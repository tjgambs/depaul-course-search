I've taken several classes with her, and I might take another if the opportunity presents itself. She's incredibly knowledgeable. She's helpful and goes out of her way to be available for students. You can't blow off her class, so only take if you actually want to learn the subject.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2011<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this teacher and this class. She lecutures a lot, most of every period, but it's always very interesting if you can follow along. I took the sophomore seminar multiculturalism philosophical approach, it was great. She really sparked my interest in philosophy. She's funny, smart, nice, a great professor overall.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2011<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DON'T TAKE HER. When she lectures, you'd think the class is super easy. Eventually, you'll be stunned on how much expectations she expect out of undergrad students. At the time she returns your assignment, you will end up in having to meet a psychiatrist to recover from the frustration caused by the so vague answers she thinks are (complete). Don't</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2011<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's pretty brilliant. Her lessons are clear and very insightful, though she tends to give some unnecessary info. Midterm/Final questions given ahead of time.HOWEVER,she didn't return anything until the week before finals. Maybe she was having an off semester. Regardless. A bit irresponsible, but likable. Returns emails and loves raisins.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2011<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amanda was a great philosopy professor, normally philosopy professor are weird, but amanda know what she talking about and make the topic sounds fun.2 film reflect paper,2 short weekly problem for homework-easy. and just make sure attend to the class and particpate you will get a good grade.

She really wants to see engagement, effort and innovation from her students.  If you read the material, pay attention, ask/answer some questions, she'll appreciate it.  She's very helpful and I've had good experiences in both her classes.  When writing papers, don't BS, she'll know.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2010<br>Class Name: PHL243<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard class but the teacher was really nice and is very exited about philosophy. if students dont participate it can be torturous! had grader in essays!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2010<br>Class Name: PHL243<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really fun class.

She is so comfortable to talk to and really enjoys what she teaches. It's a simple class in which all you have to do is pay attention and have good notes. However, she gives the questions a week before the exams and you can ask for it to be explained.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2008<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked Amanda. Shes cool and laid back. The mid term and final are passable as long as you go to class and take notes during her lectures. She gives you the questions that will be on the mid term and final. Her lectures really make the readings a lot easier to understand. The first few days are a bit rough until you get used to her style.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2008<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amanda really wanted her students to succeed. Her lectures are a bit unorganized, but it's because she is trying to explain things in so many ways so everyone can understand them. No surprises on the midterm or final. Take her if you are willing to put in the work because you will get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2007<br>Class Name: PHL245<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Quirky, funny, lively, and highly knowledgeable in the subject matter. Highly recommended. Class was: 1 in-class Mid-Term, 1 Presentation, 1 Final Essay and 2 weekly questions submitted by email. Not hard at all as long as you keep up.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2007<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely tries to explain the subject as best as she can but the texts are really complex. Uses the same complicated language the books do which is not helpful at all. Notes incredibly unorganized. No tests, no quizzes...3 short papers but they have to be perfect because she's extremely critical</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2007<br>Class Name: PHIL101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2006<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>shes bizarre, really unclear, quizzes are way hard to prepare for and it seems to really like the sound of her own voice...dont take her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/14/2006<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a good teacher but really expects a lot out of you. Lectures the entire time and tends to get very boring. Reading responses are due each week and you really MUST study for the midterm and final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Readings are rather difficult, but the lectures clarify a lot of the misunderstandings. No quizzes, no tests, and no long papers. Reader responses due every week, and midterm and final require lots of studying.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2005<br>Class Name: 100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I did not necessarily care for this class. She was not the easiest person nor the clearest one. She's too blunt and was unrealistic when it came to assessing the CLASS.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2005<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The readings were difficult for me, but when she lectured about them, they were a bit easier to understand. At one point, the whole class was failing her quizzes. When she asked what she was doing wrong, she argued with students and insisted she was right. I've had two horrible teachers at DePaul and she is one of them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok, so let's just sit back a second and realize that Philosophy 100 is a required introductory class.  Meaning that 90% of the class couldn't care less.  Oh and the reason the school has a bookstore is so that we can get the books on campus not 20 minutes away.  Basically, she wants you to regurgitate what philosophers said, not think for yourself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2005<br>Class Name: SUBFORPHL295<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her for a substitute in my Early Modern Philosophy class, and I'm so glad I got to experience her as a teacher, if only for that one day. She was incredibly clear and though she went through the material very quickly, I was able to understand everything she said. I definitely plan on taking her for philosophy in the future. Energetic & cute.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She definitely knows clearly what she is talking about, but the material was difficult to comprehend easily.  Her homework assignments are easy but her tests are difficult.  Overall, though she's nice and will explain things to you if you have trouble.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really nice.  She is a tough grader, but the class is so interesting that I did not mind getting a B.  Your grade all depends on papers--no exams.  If you have to take a PHL class, try and take her. You will learn a lot and never ever be bored. She has a true passion for Philosophy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2005<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>NICE teacher and a very smart women.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2005<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>lectures really cleared up the readings, quizzes every week but if you go to lecture or really read the readings you'll do fine.  no final, just a final paper.  very nice teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2005<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amanda is soooooooooooooo nice man!

Excellent teacher, although the class can be tough in terms of understanding concepts. There is a final paper, but no final exam. Great class to get fundamentals of business ethics. She is really pretty too ;-)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice prof.

Like every week & 1/2 you have 2 two page journal entries due. Lots and lots, I cant stress it anymore, lots of reading. Her lectures are engaging and she is really nice, but if you dont think you can deal with all the work, dont bother!

Sure, if you actually pay attention to her every word, you might get a C on the quiz. She grades the journals a little off... like she expects everyone to get a C on them. The only good thing about the class is when she erases the board... her arm moves all funny.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2005<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The thing is she is a good teacher but she gives a ton of work. Reading everday, quiz every week, and 4 pages worth of journal entries every two weeks. If you dont participate in class dont take her. Participation is 25% of the grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2005<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DONT TAKE THIS CLASS! There are other prof. that dont require as much work! She is a hard grader and asks way too much of ppl that are not Phl majors!
