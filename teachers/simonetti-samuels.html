If she has to repeat herself more than once, she starts complaining and literally yells at you! Also, she definitely does NOT know how to encourage her students, if anything she will put u down for not knowing anything in econ. JUST DON'T TAKE HER!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am graduating in June and have NEVER experienced a professor worse than her!!  Every single class, she read WORD FOR WORD off the slides.  Claims to be so intelligent yet takes no responsibilty for her teaching efforts.  Never went over the midterm with us and did not give us back our homework to study for the final.  DO NOT TAKE HER!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The WORST! How can she possibly claim to be an advanced econ teacher&#63; Not prepared..constantly late..Does not teach. All she does is mumble through the slides for 4 hours. Going to class is a waste of time!! When all students fail the midterm, you should realize you can't teach, instead of becoming mean and assigning a huge project.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>IS this her first time ever teaching&#63;  She does have some sort of illness which gives her the appearance of being tired and lazy during ever class.  Very unclear on pretty much everything--comes ill prepared with her curriculum</div></div></div></body></html>
