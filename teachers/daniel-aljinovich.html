Not only does he relate everything to Scarface, he has a ton of real world experience and loves to pick up students' cell phones.  Take notes, go to class, don't buy the book, and you will be just fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2004<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, actually made me want to go to class.

He's a great teacher and has his famous quotes of &quot;Not hard, read it like a love letter, and here we go!&quot; He's not too hard and goes off on tangents alot.
