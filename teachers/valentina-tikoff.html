She asks you to read and answer source questions - do them. Do the readings and prove that you read during discussion. She appreciates thoughtful participation. If you need help with papers, go to her office hours and talk about them. She's happy to help so take advantage of that. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2014<br>Class Name: HST298<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Tikoff? More like Professor TicksMeOff. I am really questioning my major because of her and this class. She is pretty disorganized and makes you read SO much, it's almost unbearable. The way she speaks just annoys me. She means well, but she seems very condescending when you talk to her. I recommend you avoid her at all costs.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2014<br>Class Name: HIST297<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had to drop this class. I only started it because there was nothing left when I registered. She is a nice person but is so scattered. Huge amounts of reading and primary documents. I was hugely confused from day 1. I personally need a teacher who is organized. If you do too, don't take her as a teacher. You will go mad!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2011<br>Class Name: HST172<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Miss Tikoff broke my heart. B+ :'(.Ha- Anyways, she is extremely intelligent and passionate about the material. Book is very vague and readings are very long. Essays are manageable but complicated. If you do take her, don't give her a hard time and participate. She's a very warm person and will help you out after class if you did not understand.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2011<br>Class Name: HST172<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Tikoff is really interesting. She does not choose the best books though. She loves class discussion and lecture. Her tests are difficult, but she drops your lowest one, and you have two chances for the paper. She is really smart and knows her history.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2010<br>Class Name: HIST172<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a very interesting woman. Very scatter-brained, but extremely intelligent. She really knows her material and teaches it pretty clearly. Her lectures were very helpful; but I, personally, hated the text books.  She does give a lot of reading, but with the lectures it's a pretty simple class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2010<br>Class Name: HST172<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved her! Very passionate about the subject, full of information. Class is fast-paced with lots of reading but worth it. She's very nice and always willing to help out.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/23/2010<br>Class Name: HST335<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Circle time, all the time. We sit around and listen to students present on material they haven't read. Total garbage, I want my money back.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2009<br>Class Name: HST271<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Tikoff is by far my favorite teacher at DePaul.  Her class was challenging, but very rewarding.  Be prepared for a lot of reading and great lectures!  This class will give you a very good understanding of the history of France up to the Revolution.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2009<br>Class Name: HIS271<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Tikoff is great!! ,Very passionate, energetic, and knowledgeable about the French Revolution. Lots of reading,but interesting class discussions. I loved this class and enjoyed Professor Tikoff lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2009<br>Class Name: HIST271<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have never met a more dysfunctional professor. All of her lectures are led by students, and she's a huge fan of &quot;circle time&quot;. She will sit there in silence until someone makes a comment about the reading, which there is a LOT of. Don't expect to get anything back on time. I'm still waiting for my grade in the class. She's nice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2008<br>Class Name: HIST332<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is very clear with objectives and is very passionate about subject 9(in this case French Revolution).  There was a fair amount of reading, but it was all relevant and she did her very best to ensure that every student had a chance to do very well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/11/2008<br>Class Name: HIST211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The need for a Jewish state seems much, much clearer.  Her lectures were empowering, inspiring and transforming.  It has questioned and shakened my stance as a believer, a women, and an American in a the world of today. I am forever changed and I have an appreciation for others more.  I highly recommend taking her courses. (-F.

Grade is 75% five page history papers (3), 25% participation. Discussions are student lead. Felt lost, uninterested, and couldn't please the professor. She is passionate about what she does, and is a very intelligent woman. The class was, however, the bane of my existence.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/04/2007<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ok so you're supposed to read stuff, but nobody will, so she's gonna ask the class a question, and the smart kid's gonna answer. rinse and repeat. very nice and helpful but horrible at teaching. makes you teach yourself. lectures seem to be all over the place and don't flow well.hard class. period. read what she assigns!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2007<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is insanely tough. If you can handle it, then take the class. It was my hardest honors class. All classes are discussions of readings from hw. She's passionate and willing to help, but if you're looking for an easy honors class this isn't it</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2006<br>Class Name: HST211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I LOVED prof tikoff!!  She was such an engaging professor who you could tell really loved the subject, but also wanted YOU to love it as well.  She valued our opinion and feedback a lot and while there was a lot of reading, it was worth it! Great class and EXCELLENT professor! She makes learning history a lot easier than most professors!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2006<br>Class Name: HST211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is so tough, but so good. She made me very interested in a class I didn't think I would like much. She is very interested and makes you interested. Plus she's kinda hot in a ****/teacher kind of way. (Very curvy!)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2006<br>Class Name: IMPERIALSPAIN<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow, I didn't know this course was delivered in Spanish too!  It wasn't really delivered in Spanish but Tikoff seemed like she was speaking in a foreign language the entire time.  Her lectures had no direction or organization and she is the epitome of &quot;going off on tangents.&quot;  For someone who doesn't have a prior knowledge of Spain, dont take this!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2006<br>Class Name: FRENCHREV<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful lectures, wonderful readings(TONS, though), huge focus on &quot;the argument,&quot; which can be rather frustrating if you don't read 2 or 3 times.  But great class.  She has a great passion for the subject.  If you enjoy history/historiography, TAKE this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2006<br>Class Name: HST297<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is so much reading in her class...! But quiz and paper grading is fair, she likes what she's teaching and her lectures are helpful. I'm really not into history but I would recommend her as a history teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2005<br>Class Name: HISTORY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tough to get a read on her.  She does lay out what she expects for the course on her syllabus, but getting the finer points of it is difficult.  She is not always clear when responding to questions about assignments.  She tries really hard, though.  She is engaging in class, she is always available to additional assistance, just unclear sometimes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2005<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The homework isn't fun, but she's very engaging and entertaining.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2005<br>Class Name: HST199<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Tikoff inspired me to teach History and not just study it.  Her class wasn't easy by any means but I worked my ass off for my A and when it was all done I learned so much from her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/30/2005<br>Class Name: HST355<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SHE IS VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT WHAT SHE TEACH, SHE ASSIGN LOT OF READING.

She'll squeeze blood from a turnip to get class participation even when there's none to give.  Her tests are fair.  She demands a ton of READING.  Her voice can be annoying.  Fair teacher though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2005<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A class on sugar, what can I say&#63; She assigns a lot of readings, but not too much homework. A couple papers and a group project. Mainly class discussion based. Her voice can get annoying since she's usually the one talking. Not bad, not great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2005<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's very creative and cares about each student. Her grading is fair, and she gives you lots of feedback. She wants everyone to learn to think critically and cares less about content. I recommend taking her, and definitely go to her office hours when writing a paper, she loves to help you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2005<br>Class Name: HON202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, really down-to-earth</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2004<br>Class Name: HST<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have has professor Tikoff for three classes, and although she assigns a lot of reading you learn a lot from her, and she is very easy to talk with.
