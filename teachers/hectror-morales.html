Prof. Morales went out of his way to help me and really took his time to explain this class to me.  He is an excellent professor that loves his job. :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2010<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>morales was a great professor. i've never been one to get higher than a c in a math class in my entire life-high school, middle school and all-and i got an a- in this class. he is very reasonable and gives you credit for simply being there and trying. great professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2010<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Morales is an alright professor. The LSP tutors are honestly more helpful than he is. If you need any help the tutors are available almost every day. He has you do a presentation, paper plus a final towards the end of the course which can be overwhelming if you're not prepared. Get help from the tutors if you need it and you'll be fine</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2010<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He know what he is doing, but teaches it horrible. just ask him for help on the test and he will tell you. i had no idea what i was doing but somehow managed to pull off a B! :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2010<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely Terrible! He teaches material that most people are not familiar with and yet has a complete attitude when you do not understand.  He grades difficulty and yet offers no help for improvement.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2010<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Morales was great. However, prepare for some really stupid people in this class because you're going to have to work in groups. The material is really easy, but some people, for some reason, either don't listen or can't absorb anything. Maybe I just got stuck with the brainless ones. Anyway Dr. Morales is very helpful and clear.</div></div></div></body></html>
