We watch videos. She asks questions and we raise our hands to answer. We have partner projects and quizzes. There was neither a midterm nor a final exam. She is a very sweet old lady. She appreciates students who exceed the expectations. Easy class if you do the work. On our last day of class, she bought us all pizza!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2012<br>Class Name: EE324<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the best. She is very helpful and cares a lot about young teachers becoming the best they can be. She has the best openers to class where everyone stands up and does a rhyming activity. She cares about what you have to say and does private conversations for experiences at your observations just to make sure you're getting something from it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2012<br>Class Name: EE324<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take her. She is extremely boring, she uses the same lectures and assignments over and over again. She does not like differing opinions on anything. Forget e-mailing her because it takes days for her to get back to you, if at all. You will be nothing,but frustrated if you take her course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2012<br>Class Name: ECE290<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Mossi sort of boring but she makes in effort to make every class semi interesting. There are alot of group projects in this class. Including your final project as a group project.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2009<br>Class Name: ECE303<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OMG. Ok shes a nice lady but soooo boring! I feel like that class was a waste because I didn't learn a single thing while being in there! We do useless presentations and all she does it go on and on about how teaching was back in the 1960s..save yourself the boredom.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2008<br>Class Name: ECE310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great teacher. Class can get boring sometimes but we sing songs and do lots of fun projects. She is very passionate about children and is a great role model. Take her if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/24/2007<br>Class Name: ECE303<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Does not deal well with being proved wrong. Ignores the obvious truth. Not very willing to accept other's point of view.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2006<br>Class Name: ECE303<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ms. Moss is a doll!!!  She is outspoken and passionate about children and their education.  I am not an early childhood education major, but I still enjoyed the class.  The assignments are not terribly difficult, but they each have a purpose, and help you understand the true meaning and philosophy behind ECE.  I would take her again if I could.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2006<br>Class Name: EE344<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's a fun class...you do art projects and sing songs (seriously) She can be quite wierd, and do not leave her class early she will hunt you down...hahaha</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2006<br>Class Name: ECE310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2005<br>Class Name: TL407408<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Alice Moss is the best education professor at DePaul!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2005<br>Class Name: EE347<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Moss is wise and knowledgeable in the field of Children's Lit. She is helpful, understanding, reasonable and really encourages student participation in the course. Although the course is relatively easy, what one receives from the course as a developing educator is mind-blowing.</div></div></div></body></html>
