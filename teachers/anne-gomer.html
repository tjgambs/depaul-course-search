Her explanations of the material are very clear. Quizzes are not hard if you do the homework. Definitely take the class with her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2011<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>CalcII is so much more boring than CalcI. If you don't like to listen to lectures and just follow along on the board do not take her. I got easily bored and ended up barely passing the midterm. The material is easy, but if you're easily bored I would not recommend her at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2010<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You cannot be absent because you will miss a lot of material. Quiz mostly every week but they're VERY easy as long as you pay attention and follow along with the lesson. If you tend to ask a lot of questions I wouldn't recommend her because she isn't very clear with her answers but if you can just follow along you'll get at least a B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2010<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is one funny old lady. Sometimes the way she teaches can be sporatic BUT at the end of the day just pay attention. She writes down every single step & most professors dont do that at alll. I didnt do well at all on the midterm and ended up with a A-. Just do alll the homework, do well on the quiz and the final. Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2010<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She isn's the best teacher in the world, but if you just pay attention in class you will be ok.  If you took Calc in high school this class should be a breeze.  Do the homework she assigns, it will pay off in the end.  The quizzes she gives are super easy and so was the midterm!  Easiest math class I have ever taken.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2010<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's...interesting.  She's quit elderly and thus spaces out a lot during class.  Many times she has a hard time understanding what questions people are asking and can get upset easily.  She has good intentionst though! While maybe not the best prof for teaching she's certainly not the worst.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2010<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE HER IF YOU ARE NOT GOOD AT MATH. She's unapproachable, unhelpful and get all prissy if you ask questions. She states that she loves teaching when really she just loves the stupid subject. She's a difficult person and doesn't truly care about teaching,</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2010<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a funny little woman...teaches very well..couple of quizzes mostly take home...midterm and a final...but the main thing is YOU HAVE TO DO HOMEWORK!! otherwise your not going to do well...n if you ask a question and its too long she'll tell u to meet her after class in her office..willing to help but not during class!! TAKE HER!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2009<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved her!! shes really nice and clear and made me laugh a couple times. She made calculus easy! and I haven't taken a math class in 4 years. I dont think she shuts u down when u ask questions at all. She will go over whatever you don't understand. I'm definitely taking her again</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2009<br>Class Name: BMS135<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My 2nd time taking it. Much easier this time around. Last teacher didnt have us turn in anything so i slacked off. HW due every class, only worth 5% tho. Quiz once a week sometimes, few times will be take home. Dont ask questions in class though, she may put you on the spot and pick on you when someone else brings up the same thing. Do able class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2009<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is clear at teaching and takes a lot of time to explain the problems. If you get confused you can always see her during office hours. She's nice, but tends to insult students if they ask questions she thinks they should know. Extremely boring class, but good for learning the material. Oh, and she doesn't officially take attendance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2009<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super easy to follow, all she does is write on the board for the ENTIRE class period! Sometimes hard to sit through, but everything seemed like a review of high school AP, pure recollection. Beware though, if you like to ask questions she will SHUT YOU DOWN. just dont do it</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>EASY TEACHER! everything is clear and she is very organized. She goes through every little step, which i sometimes found annoying. She goes very slow so that people can follow along, again, it was annoying. I would have liked her to go faster. And it is true that you can hand in homework as late as you want and she will still accept it. Overall, ve</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2008<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the best teacher to take. Very sarcastic. She started to do roll call but after 2 weeks attendance was not counted. HW everyday but you can turn it in as late as you want. Midterm and final really easy because her review is the exact same thing!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2008<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Go to class, do ok (like a B) on the mid-term, do the homework, and you are guranteed an A.  She grades on attendence and participation more than what you actually do on the exams.  She is a must take when she is available.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gomer is sort of spacy, but she's an excellent professor, i didn't think i'd do so well in calculus, but she definitely helped make it easy. As long as she sees effort, she'll give you an A. TAKE HER!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2007<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best calc professor at depaul! She will explain the material until you get it and goes super slow showing you every step. Her tests are the same as the examples she does in class. Do your homework, pay attention and study your quizzes  and you'll do great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2007<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is no way you can't love this professor...you get an A if you turn in all the homework and work hard. She wants you to pass, and i'm so lucky i got her for both calculus classes. Go to class, it makes the material easier to understand, and turn in your homework--you should be ok.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2007<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All you have to do is do all the homework assignments and the quizzes and you will have an easy B.  She is great, doesnt answer questions very well but a great teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2007<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's pretty easy and definitely explains every type of problem you need to know.  Stats is not the most exciting class, but it's not a bad GPA booster.  Just do your homework and you'll be fine.  She also lets you take a formula sheet into the midterm and final...which is awesome.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2006<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love this woman.

All you have to do is show up to class. Do all your homework, And you'll be fine. I honestly got an average of C's on my quizzes, a C+ on my midterm, and ended up with an A- in her class. She is easy! I love her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/13/2006<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SHES EASY AS HELL</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2006<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i just took the midterm and it was really hard!  had her for bms125 and i thought this class would be easy, but i was wrong. i suggest you avoid this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2006<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you're not very good in math, don't take this class.

She's very unclear, so you basically have to teach yourself and when you go to ask her a question, she kind of spaces out.  She is a cute old lady though (cute only on the outside).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2006<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow, she is really spacy and a little crazy.  However she is a decient teacher.  I did next to nothing and didn't show up for a lot of classes and got a very good grade.  2 tests plus a cumulative final.  Some of the questions on the final were the exact same questions from the previous tests so study them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2006<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor for math.

I felt like I was back in middle school in this class. (we spent over three classes on mean, median, and mode) super easy class especially if you've had a solid math background. All of the material was covered in my calc 1 class in highschool so i aced this class with no effort.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/14/2006<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Explains everything well, the midterm and final are exactly like the review sheets she gives out, lets you correct all the quizzes.Definitely take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2006<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>explains everything step by step clearly and slowly. gotta take her for any math classes. only downside is there's weekly quizzes and daily hw. but the hw goes unchecked sometimes and she gives you a chance to make up your mistakes on the quiz. still, gotta take her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2005<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really good at explaining the material. Probably one of the best math teachers at DePaul. She is willing to help you too.

I have never been good in any kind of math and was scared of calculus, but she was very helpful and takes out all the class time needed to make sure everyone understands what is going on.

Goes very slow and teaches the material very well. Can't beat her pace and midterms/exams, she gives the exact problem but diff. numbers. She also lets you write down what grade you think u deserve.

She has a tendancy to get tripped up by questions which can be distracting but will take the time to work things out. Very straight forward, what you see is what you get.
