Pay attention in his class, do his HW religiously and with a little help from his generous grading methods you should love ECON! I would take him again. Absolutely inspirational!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2014<br>Class Name: ECON555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Good guy, lecture notes a little hard to follow so make sure you take your own. Exams are just like HW problems</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2013<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Things move VERY quickly and it is often difficult to get a good handle on the material before moving on to the next topic.  To be fair, the format of the homework and class notes is very open and convenient.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2012<br>Class Name: ECON555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's smart, no doubt about it, but terrible at teaching.  Not an uncommon theme for professors I've had.  I don't understand this guy at all but totally respect him.  I just don't think he should be teaching, and he's incredibly arrogant.  I'm a very diligent and ambitious student with a 3.75 GPA but struggled with Dr. Donley on many levels.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2012<br>Class Name: ECON555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was not easy, but that was due to material.  Professor was always available.  Test questions were similar to homework questions, he let us have 2-sided note sheet with anything on it, including sample problems for each exam.  He weighted the exam you scored better on 40%, the other 20%.  Really enjoyed the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/18/2010<br>Class Name: ECON555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great, no BS guy. I respect him plenty. Class was very hard for me, but learned so much from it. Very fair about grading, and if you put in the effort, he will work with you if you're struggling. Study, study, study.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/14/2009<br>Class Name: ECO502<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A bit intense but don?t worry- he?s a good guy. If you do poorly on the midterm, GO TALK TO HIM; he wants you to do well. He?ll work with you even if you?re like me and need things repeated 3x. He is the econ master, but isn?t afraid to say I don?t know ? then he?ll find out and post it to BB. ALWAYS check SOC on tests. Enjoy the chalk flipping!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2008<br>Class Name: ECON555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Work with classmates on hw. Professor is more than willing to help after class; sitting in lectures you may end up bewildered/amused. Outlines are very useful- be sure to take your own notes for clarification. Tests are similar to homework Qs, but don't rely on your crib sheet. You really have to understand, not just memorize material to do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/15/2008<br>Class Name: ECO375<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just bad!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/13/2007<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I will say that Professor Donley knows what he's talking about, but he talks to his class like colleagues rather than students. I'm sure if you are really interested in Econ you will like him, but in my opionion he was really hard to keep up with. If you need to be TAUGHT, I wouldn't recommend him. I definately wish I had taken someone else...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/07/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dynamite professor.  True economist, teaches efficiently and relates material to the real world well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2007<br>Class Name: ECON375<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I heart regression.  Great teacher.  Has a good handle on how students learn. Homework was useful.  Tests are H-A-R-D. They include proofs and notation is very important. Good guy though and fun to talk to outside of class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a good teacher.  He explains the sometimes difficult material well and his tests are fair.  Grade includes a few HW assignments, midterm, and final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Is a fair grader, but most of topics covered are better explained by the book and his notes provided than by his lectures.  Sometimes gets off topic in lecture, which makes topics more confusing than they are laid out in his notes.  Is not a difficult class overall.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor.  Moves fast, but is willing to explain anything.  Extremely knowledgeable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2007<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor. Knows his subject. Must read textbook and do your homework to understand the exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2006<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No econ class is going to be easy but this guy  taught what we needed to know for the real world. He is very helpful but i must say this class was hard.  There is homework that is graded and then a midterm and a final</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2006<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great prof. great man take him if you want to learn something</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2006<br>Class Name: ECO375<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Donley is an Econmotrecian in the purist sense; he'll push you to dig deep into some regression analysis and general calculus. The class isn't as tough as I expected, however there is an extensive amount of material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2005<br>Class Name: ECON375<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought this class was going to kick my ass.  I avoided it like the plague but was surprised at how thorough his explanations were.  I really enjoyed it.  Don't get lazy in doing your assignments, especially the programming side.  It is extremely helpful for understanding of the concepts.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2004<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Knows his stuff, very interesting and fair.

VERY clear on everything.  Only problem is the multiple choice on his tests; there are 10-15 on each, and all very tough. Midterm = 40% Final = 40% Homework = 20%.  Take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2004<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His lectures are pretty easy, although he may move fast, but if you ask him to slow down he certainly will.  He is more than happy to help you outside of class.  Just be ware, his midterm and final are tough!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2004<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He sometimes moves fast, but slows down if you ask. He's very approachable. HW due once a week, but doesn't take attendance. 2 exams both 40%. I thought it was an easy and good class but i know others didn't agree.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2004<br>Class Name: ECON555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Challenging class and this guy knows his stuff, but getting it accross is the problem.

Make sure you look over his lecture notes and you'll be cool. Homework is really easy, everything you need to know is in his notes. Midterm and Final aren't bad all.

Very difficult.  Homework very challenging.  He is very knowledgeable, but goes way too fast.
