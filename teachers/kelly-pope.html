Loves the topic she teaches, and she makes you love it too. Kept the night class interesting with different styles of teaching like videos, handouts, lectures, and hands on activities. Very clear on what you will be tested on. Wish she taught more graduate level classes so I could take her again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2014<br>Class Name: 635<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher! Really loves the material she teaches and keeps it very interesting. Only issue is that she doesn't respond to emails so if you miss anything you won't get any response.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2013<br>Class Name: ACC555ONLINE<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy online class.

She makes it extremely easy to pass with an A if you actually study. She clearly explains and teaches the material in a way that is easy to understand and learn. Great professor. Earned an A and didn't have to take the final. Would definitely recommend! One of the few good accounting professors at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2012<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great online class. Pope gives clear directions on what to study for tests, the cases. There are Wimba online sessions every Sunday and more are required where she goes thru all the chapters assigned, responds to questions on the case problems assignments. Highly recommended. Final exam optional. Books on white collar crime were great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2012<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she was a pretty good... she tells you exactly what is going to be on the test, so there is no surprises ...just study hard and you would get that A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2011<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Pope is one of the best!!

She tells you whats going to be on test, had many review sessions, I recommend reading Chapter before class lectures and Study H.W. sets problems. You will get an A in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2011<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great professor! She tells you exactly what will be on the test and as long as you study that you will do great.

As long as you study and keep up with the class you should ace her tests. Make sure to study what she tells is going to be on the test because it is. She is funny and has a great personality.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2011<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not very organised and is very defensive. will never take another class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2011<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Exam problems are mostly from the optional homework assignments and not really from the assigned case homework she does assign which I thought was odd. Overall, the class was interesting. I like reading about the 2 accounting fraud stories. If you take this class online, make sure you review the optional questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2010<br>Class Name: ACCT303<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. She is ready to help anytime. It's best to read the chapters before class because she goes through the material quickly, so this way you'll be familiar with the topic. Professor Pope also gives great review before the tests. Also, if you are satisfied with your grade, you don't have to take the final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2010<br>Class Name: ACCT303<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. Goes over the problems in a way that is logical and she does them the same way every time, that way you know how to handle any quest. Gives alot of materials/problems to practice so you can study for the tests. I studied for a week and got an A on one of the tests. Doesn't curve. She really wants the students to learn. U can tell.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2010<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is a fireball!  Highly recommend e book with homework helper! The hmwk cases require thorough understand of material.  Highlight of class is her research and interviews which make this class like a CSI of cost acctng. Do cases before Wimba for most help.  Had dinner with Aaron Beam - founding/ fallen CFO of Healthsouth because of PP.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2010<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was phenomenal.  I took an online version of ACC 555 - and since she gave us her home and cell phone numbers, it was easy to get her help when the homework was too tough.  If anything, this class was almost too easy, even though I'm not an accountant (though easiness is not a bad thing if your'e still learning)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2010<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's teaching managerial accounting for online class. At first she's very responsive and replying all emails that I sent almost immediately. Towards the end of the quarter, she seems like disappeared and never replied to emails.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2010<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved the class and all the extra credit before midterm only thing I hated was the COOKIE PROJECT other than that enjoyed the class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2009<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a nice person and wants everyone to do well, but you really have to put in the time outside of class if you want to do good. All the work is done in class, therefore no assigned homework but she expects you to do all the problems on your own time. There are 2 exams and if you get an A or B on both then you don't have to take the final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2009<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher! Her material is extensive, but for crying out loud do the in class work before you get to class! It's on the syllabus, though not required! You wont feel like an idiot when she burns through the material due to time constraints. Plenty of extra credit before the midterm. :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2008<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was responsive to email questions, but she didn't grade homework quickly.  We took both the midterm and final without knowing how we did on our homework.  Her Blackboard site was kind of a mess, old lectures and missing various items due to &quot;technical&quot; problems.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/18/2008<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i would like to know who professor pope help land a job. she only taught one 303 section last quarter and i dont think that she was helpful at all. dont get me wrong she is a wonderful person but as a professor she is horrible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2008<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I learned a ton from this class...I have read the comments and I can't understand. She is one of the best professors I have had at DePaul AND she helped me land my first job! She knows a lot and you have to work very hard. She cares about her students and helps you learn.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2008<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was very intense and time consuming. Given this was an online course, the professor did an excellent job of explaining things when anyone was stuck. She was very helpful in answering questions.  Weekly conference calls were held and attendance wasn?t necessary. The calls were recorded so you could listen to them any time during the week.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2008<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>RUN! RUN! ...run far FAR AWAY!! Saying she is the worst teacher ever would be an understatement.  She is very knowledgeable on the topic but is the farthest thing from a teacher.  anyone else would be better.  NO one finished the midterm it was impossible. Says one thing and does another and takes forever to post grades.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2008<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!

Her method is to give you a ton of work and hopes that you learn from it.  It's always up to you, which method you will benefit from the most.
