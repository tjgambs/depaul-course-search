I have taken him four times so far, and I will most likely take a class ith him again. He does assian a bit too much homework, which is due the next class period, and he seems to love questions with parts a, b, c, d, and e at least.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2007<br>Class Name: PHY170<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Pando is very good at what he does. I came into physics thinking that the university level would be almost impossible, but he made things alot easier. Obviously the material is dense and difficult (it's physics!), but Pando is good at answering questions and works with the students. Definitely a good teacher to have. I'd recommend him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2006<br>Class Name: PHY170<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good at relating to students of all levels. By far my favorite professor at depaul that i have come by</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2006<br>Class Name: PHY170<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jesus is an awesome teacher.  He is extremely available outside of class.  His tests are somewhat hard but he gives lots of partial credit.  I highly reccomend taking his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2006<br>Class Name: PHY170<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is really a great guy and always offering to help with any problems you need. He does not have a curve on his tests but an 85 will most likely give you an A. I really enjoy the class and the quiz section is very helpful if you don't understand the homework.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/24/2006<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He made the first week really fun. We went to the aquarium, the zoo and the park. He would end class early and let us wonder around on our own and he really didn't give us much work to do. He was really funny and encouraged you to speak when you had something to say. Highly reccomended for an ISP course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/01/2006<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So nice and laid back about everything.  Really has a lot of tolerance for noise.  On the final paper, it seems you can choose to write about whatever you want, as long as you make it interesting and somewhat relate it to sound.  Easy to meet and talk to as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2005<br>Class Name: DISCOVER<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Regardless of the fact that I learned nothing in this class and have no idea what to write for my final 10 pg paper...JESUS IS THE****!  He is extremely laid back.  During the &quot;Discover Week,&quot; we did nothing that had to do w/ sound, got out of class early every day, and had an awesome time!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2005<br>Class Name: PHYSICS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2005<br>Class Name: DIGITAL<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While I felt like at times he was just teaching for the book, I still learned what I needed to.

He's kind of a boring lecturer as well and can make you feel a bit stupid at times.  I thought he was alright, but I am sure there is a better teacher to take for this class..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2004<br>Class Name: REL<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2003<br>Class Name: DISCOVER<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr Pando is a good teacher, but his class can be a bit confusing.

I was in his office at least once a week getting homework help, and he always...always helped me out.
