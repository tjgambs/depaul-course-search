He is honestly one of the genuinely nicest people I have ever met and clearly cares about his students. 3 6page essays midterm final and few quizzes, lots of readings, but what really matters is the participation.

I found the subject dreadfully boring and his voice wasn't helpful. 3 6pg papers, 3 pop quizzes, & he tells you what's on the midtermfinal.

Everything is covered in class, so no need to read the source material. Discussions are thought-provoking and in-depth. He makes sure everyone understands. He also doesn't mind being interrupted with questions, and understands his job is to teach, not to lecture. Wasn't really looking forward to the class, but I ended up liking it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2012<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! One of the nicest, most understanding professors who is very easy to talk to and passionate about the subject.

He understands that we are bombarded with work so he would give you a few more days to work on papers if you have a legitimate excuse. The only thing that he expects from you is to have original work, he has zero tolerance for plagiarism.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2012<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you do the readings and pay attention to the lectures, it is pretty easy to get at least a B+ in the class. He only takes attendance the first two weeks and is very helpful if you have any questions. Also, he allows you an extra day or two on papers if you have a legitimate excuse.</div></div></div></body></html>
