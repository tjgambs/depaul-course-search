The topics were boring and attending class is a pain but you have to go because attendance is taken. This was more of an annoying writing class rather than a religion class. Blogs due every week. Not fun. Take something else.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2010<br>Class Name: CTH265<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher but doesn't clarify things.

He's pretty vague as to what he expects in his journals. You're not really rewarded for working hard. Someone who shows up to one class, and someone who shows up to all of them can can get the same grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2008<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good teacher not very difficult and not much homework. Just do the reading for a daily Iclicker quiz and you will be fine. Four papers two hard ones and two easy ones basically. Take him if you need this requirement!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/22/2008<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BEst teacher and class ever.Prof really care.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2007<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Kelley is one of the most interesting professors I've had at DePaul. I thought that a class on Business Ethics would be bland ,however it turned out to be my favorite class of the quarter. He ties in current issues regarding global warming and poverty. There is a decent amount of work but if you put in the time you will get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2007<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor ever. So intelligent and clever. The class is not impossible, work hard and you'll get the grade you deserve. Definately take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/17/2007<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great prof. and has alot to teach, but he should be in the CTI building . All blackboard! i thought coming into this it was going to be easy... do a few postings and thats that; all wrong!! he grades them pretty harshly- write many!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2007<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Um I got an A, and didn't have to read any of the material, and still understood it. His activities were kind of boring, and pointless, but I urge you to take him, will be your easiest honors class if you do!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2007<br>Class Name: RELI228<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He doesn't make clear it what he wants. You use discussion board on a daily bases. I think he should teach this class on line instead of in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/30/2006<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Never talked to him once during the entire quarter.  Entirely online work.  Make sure you keep up with the online postings because he'll grade you on them with no warning.  Overall easy class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2006<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>To other Honors students, I strongly suggest you take this class!  Dr. Kelley is enthusiastic, offers much out-of-class help, and is very knowledgeable.  His essays are graded fairly and his lectures are intriguing.  I got nearly a hundred percent in the course because I worked hard on the essays and read diligently.  Final words: take his class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2006<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. Keeps the classes interesting by mixing it up with lectures, class discussions, movies, etc. Lots of reading and three papers to do but you know about them in advance and he is willing to work with you on it. Big on Discussion Board use. My favorite class of the quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2006<br>Class Name: CTH226<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is by far the most beautiful, intelligent, entrancing professor I have ever experienced. His lectures are passionate and understandable. I found myself constantly wanting to write down ever word uttered by this brilliant, boyishly cute, gift from Jesus...thank you Jesus.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2006<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Kelly is a great teacher. The class isn't easy but don't give up because you get a lot out of class. I worked hard and got the grade I deserved. He has a great sense of humor and is very smart!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/28/2006<br>Class Name: REL223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kelley is the smartest teacher I've had. He's incredibly helpful and interesting. He grades papers closely and points out every individual logical flaw even when you tried to hide it really well. He's fair and switches classes up so that you'll never get bored. But there's a fair amount of reading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2006<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is definitely good looking and the class is pretty entertaining...a too much busy work given, but overall a good class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2006<br>Class Name: REL282<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is really nice, smart, and he adjusted the class half way through to meet what we wanted to talk about. He wants to keep everyone interested, and he wants everyone to be able to write well, so that's why he graded tough on papers. He's awesome, and a really nice guy to talk to on a personal basis. Highly Recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2006<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great professor, really interesting and strives to teach his class about important issues.  Gives his students opportunities to pull up their grade and is a some what a hard grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2006<br>Class Name: REL282<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Kelly is a really nice guy. He will adjust the homework load/difficulty according to the ability of the class. He very critical on writing assignments, but not to a fault. Pretty laid back in general. Recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2006<br>Class Name: BUSINESSETHICS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had to read A LOT and write two papers that he graded VERY tough.

Ethics he goes know where you learn very little. You have 2 papers that he grades VERY TOUGH.  ALL of the students had to rewrite the 1st paper b/c he failed almost everyone.  He might turn out okay at the end of the quarter but right now i would say Dont Take HIM, NOT an easy class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2006<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>hes an awesome teacher, very smart and helpfull, sets very clear guidelines to follow, he manages to make the class interesting, expects to read a lot but you dont have to do it to do well in the class. i would def take his class again</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: CTH226<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very nice guy...not a hard class...did well and didn't do too much</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2006<br>Class Name: REL<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HE IS VERY BORING, AND IS AN IMPOSSIBLE GRADER.

YOU LEARN A LOT, BUT YOU DO HAVE TO DO WORK. WEEKLY READING IS ABOUT 100 PAGES. WEEKLY PAPERS ABOUT THE READING. PAPERS ARE HARD AT FIRST BUT THEY GET MUCH EASIER. GRADING IS BASED ON YOUR WEEKLY PAPERS AND FINAL. NOT HARD AT ALL BECAUSE THE PROFESSOR EXPLAINS IT ALL VERY WELL.
