She has no idea what she's teaching ever and she's extremely rude. I would never suggest her to anyone. I'm terrible at math so I need a good teacher in order to do well and she could not be any worse. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/04/2015<br>Class Name: 130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>She's a good professor overall! Math is not something that I am good at, but she explained everything and was available during office hours if needed.  She used mymathlabs for homework's and quizzes so as long as you do them on time you will be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2015<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the better math professors DePaul has to offer. Very sweet lady and clear in her lectures, although there will be times you want to get up and leave because math is never really that fun.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2015<br>Class Name: PRECALC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very sweet professor. Really understanding as well, if you need help just talk to her after class she helps big time. Midterm and final are easy if you did mylabplus which is the key of the class, she test what she explains. A little boring but then again this is math lol. quiz every week but dont stress that just helps. got an A :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2014<br>Class Name: PRECALC<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>awesome teacher and sweet lady. she answers all questions. she lets everyone do test corrections on every test, even the midterm. easy class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2013<br>Class Name: MA130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>boring class, but you can makeup almost all work to get a higher grade! easy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2012<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ms. Potaniec was a really nice professor and would take the time to help you.  Considering how bad I am at math the class was really easy and if you do the mymathlab work well you will most likely end up with a B at the least just study for the final since that dropped my grade from and A- to B+.  Overall easy class just it can get really boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2012<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice teacher but I didn't really learn anything from her. I based all my learning from mymathlab, its helpful but very time consuming. If you do all the work in this class you should get a good grade. The good thing about her is she lets you redo all your in class quizzes and midterm to receive half credit for everything you got wrong.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2012<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I won't sayit was an easy class as math is not my strong suit however, if you do all your homework, study for the quizes you will do fine. Make sure you do My Math Lab</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2011<br>Class Name: MAT131<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Love her. Makes class interesting and fun. I feel that the ability to learn math, is based on how good your teacher is, and she is great!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2011<br>Class Name: MTH130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AMAZING TEACHER!!!! Extremely helpful when you need it.  Make sure to do My Math Lab or else you won't get a good grade.  Lets you correct quizzes and mid-term.  She is an awesome teacher and super nice.  She also gets back to your e-mails right away with any questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2011<br>Class Name: MATH130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HIGH USE OF MY MATH LAB, WHICH IS A VERY GREAT LEARNING TOOL. HER TEACHING TECHNIQUES WERE EASY TO GRASP. I ENJOYED HER AS A PROFESSOR....WISH SHE TAUGHT MATH 135/136 :-))</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2009<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I learned solely from the Online MyMathLab Course, rather than the Ms.Potaniec. However, she allowed us to work in class online on our homework. There was a lot of online assinments...and I hate math so it was boring. But I learned from them. Never take a 3 hour class it was pure torture. Easy quizzes every class. A midterm & a Final. I got an A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2009<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class relied heavily on a new online system for HW, Quizes, grades, etc, which was easy -- no handouts, notebooks, loosefeaf to carry around or turn in. Allowed to correct quizes and tests. If you can't get an A or B in MAT 101 with Pontaniec, you were **** to show up or just don't belong at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2008<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yes, yes, and yes! I no longer fear math. Her focus is not on the grade, but on whether or not you understand the material. Lets you re-do quizzes & mid-term for 1/2 credit, which REALLY helps. Always available for help. Gave me an extension on h/w. Always reviews before the quiz. And there's the 'joke of the day!'You will NOT regret taking her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2008<br>Class Name: MATH130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great teacher. Helps you out if you need it.  Review prior to quizzes. Lets you redo quizes for 1/2 credit. I would highly recommend her would take her again if i could. Hate math but she made it easy :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2008<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a really nice lady. She takes the time to help if you ask for it. The course was online, and the homework could be done over and over again until it was correct. Very easy class but don't let the 3 hours of lecture make you zone out.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2008<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Made material very easy to understand. The night classes were long, but the class was bearable.

If you take the 3hr class, there is SOOOOO much time to ask questions in class, so you really don't have to do much work outside of class.    You know exactly what your grade is throughout the entire quarter.  She teaches the material to you like you are 5 (in a good way).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2005<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the type of teacher you'd expect in high school! She's very sweet and tries to explain if you don't understand in different ways, easier or not they are ways to try. Joke of the day... it's a nice break from a 3 hr and 15 min class. NEVER SUBJECT YOURSELF TO THAT, unless you like math. It's not her fault, that's just a god a lot of math.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2005<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a pretty boring professor and talks to you like you know what you are supposed to do...I often get lost and think I do terribly but in reality I'm not doing that bad..If you are willing to be bored shes not that bad just don't take the 3 hr and 15 min class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/08/2005<br>Class Name: MATH141<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's sooo awesome.
