Easy material, but having to listen to him is brutal. He LOVES hearing himself talk and tries to be the hip cool professor when he should be worrying about decently structured lesson plans. Avoid him if you want to actually learn something applicable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2013<br>Class Name: COM101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's great!

Although stubborn, he doesn't belittle you if your opinions differ from his own. Look forward to taking many more of his classes. Other Professors need to take note!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2013<br>Class Name: COM101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sean is honestly the best professor I've had at DePaul. His classes are not mandatory (attendance isn't part of your grade) and they're in the loop, and I still went every time because it's such a great class. It's very interesting, not difficult at all if you apply yourself, and he makes it super fun!!! Definitely take this class!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2013<br>Class Name: COM101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He loves hearing himself talk. Very easy class, but nothing you would actually want to retain for future use. Overall, he is awful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2013<br>Class Name: COM<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you're looking for a professor who is more concerned with picking favorites and being buddybuddy with students, this is your guy. If you want to learn something legitimate, look elsewhere. I am a stats major, and I can tell you the studies he has done are terrible (he attempts to correct them so much they become invalid).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2013<br>Class Name: CMNS530<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sean is nice, but spends too much time making friends. That's fine for undergrad, but it's frustrating for grad students taking time away from their responsibilities to attend class. It was common to not finish all of the readings because so much time was spent socializing. Makes sense he does well in large lectures- he wants an audience.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2012<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Horan made a 3 hour night class enjoyable. He's such a funny guy and is pretty laid back. 2 papers and 2 short exams. He really knows what he is talking about and is the best teacher I've ever had at DePaul. I would reccomend this class to anyone</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2012<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best and most social people...helped me with a lot of out of class help in understanding social meetings/communication between humans.

Was in a big class so it's hard to keep a focus on the topic sometimes but he does engage other students in the class for discussions. Tended to go off on Jersey Shore tangents at times but it was rare.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2012<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sean is a great teacher, one of my favorites.  I would definitely recommend taking his class, and register early because his classes go fast!  He assigns readings but you never have to read them.  His class isnt mandatory for attendance but i never missed a class because they are so fun.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2012<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>easy class, simply assignments. i mean he doesn't talk about communications at all. you can tell he is there to make friends not teach. but whatever, take him because you dont have to show up and he'll grade easy. nice guy though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2012<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So funny and great at conversing with a big class, I loved having him as a Professor although he does grade his midterm paper kinda hard. Just don't wait last minute on the midterm paper and you're good to go.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2012<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far the best professor I've had at DePaul. I was in a class of 120 and he made it seem like it was only 30 of us. He engaged everyone in conversation and kept the class laughing the whole time. I recommend taking him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/23/2012<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor I've had at DePaul.

He teaches in a very lighthearted and funny tone, and conveys the material very well. His syllabus and grading criteria are straightforward. I recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2011<br>Class Name: CMNS291<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I dreaded Research Methods but Sean made the class fun and entertaining. He takes subjects he knows we dont want to learn and breaks them down very well and goes over them many times. I couldn't have imagined a different teacher for this course. He was a pleasure to have.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2011<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>yes</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2011<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far the best professor I have ever had at DePaul.

He knows what he's talking about and he knows how to lecture so young adults understand.  He references reality tv all the time and makes the whole class laugh the entire time. I would recommend Sean to ANYONE having to take CMN 101.  I am definitely going to take another one of his classes!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2011<br>Class Name: COM101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Greatest teacher I have had at DePaul so far.

I learned so much from him in one quarter than I have 3 years at DePaul! He's smart and he knows his stuff! I honestly am taking another class of his next quarter!

I literally looked forward to his Comm101 class twice a week. He makes any subject fun and his sense of humor is amazing. I am doing everything in my power to have him as a teacher as much as possible. I highly recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2011<br>Class Name: CMN311<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sean is awesome.  He's a great guy, with a great personality, and he is extremely knowledgable on every subject that he teaches.  Class is always fun. He is totally cynical and that is part of his charm. If I wasn't graduating I'd take all of the classes that he teaches. I def. recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2011<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing teacher!

He is approachable, engaging, knowledgeable, credible, & has an awesome sense of humor. There was constant laughter in class, EVERY class. I learned so much! DEFINITELY going to take him again! I loved his course so much that I've decided to switch my major to communications.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2011<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sean is a terrific teacher! He knows the material very well. Go to class, take notes, participate. I know I will never have another class like it and that makes me sad... all teachers should be like this!  I GUARANTEE I had the best class of people as well!  Anyone who thinks that he is &quot;weird&quot; has to be socially inept.  He is a riot!  TAKE HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/18/2011<br>Class Name: COM101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>hes alright, i heard he eats cat food on the weekends..but whatever</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2010<br>Class Name: COMM101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy knows more about Jersey Shore than I do.

You can tell he thinks very highly of himself. I agree with the other poster.... he wants to be on Jersey Shore.  I think this guy would make a better high school teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/08/2010<br>Class Name: CMN200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OH MY GOSH. This guy was like Jersey Shore before it even aried. He talked more about his flat screen TV than research methods, whcih is cool and all, but not when you need to pass the class to graduate. I can understand why people like him, but come on, grow up. I don't spend $10,000 per quarter to hear about your fancy tv.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2010<br>Class Name: COM101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What the students below me consider &quot;weird&quot;, I consider &quot;endlessly entertaining&quot;.

He has a big head.  Kind of weird, but very funny.  He makes class fun and makes sure his students understand the material clearly before moving on. Very helpful and relates more to us because he's young himself. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! Still weird though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2010<br>Class Name: CMN211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't pass up a chance to have Sean as a professor. He's young so he definitely knows how to relate to his students, and not only that but he actually KNOWS what he's talking about! He's very passionate about his work, and knows VERY effective teaching methods. I can only hope to take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2010<br>Class Name: COM211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HIGHLY RECOMMEND! you are crazy not to take a class of his. He keeps your attention the whole class time, and makes every assignment clear on what he wants. If you pay attention you will pass the class with flying colors. I'd definitely take him for another class again. His class was one I looked forward to week after week. TAKE HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2010<br>Class Name: CMNS211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sean is the reason I am a Communication Studies major. He is so passionate about this stuff that he makes you want to love the course material just as much. He has the greatest teaching style and you're an idiot if you don't take at least one class with him in your life time. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</div></div></div></body></html>
