He's hard to understand and makes things more complicated than the book. He cannot keep track of students quizzes or Exams. He loses about half of them so even though his quizzes are easy the fact that he loses them will hurt your grade significantly. If college is not a joke to you find another Prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2009<br>Class Name: CALC151<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took this course with two other teachers and could not pass no matter how much I went to SI. Class is fair and simple do the homework you'll ace the tests. DePaul needs more math teachers like Dr. Stokolos he is soft spoken but you get used to it. Its 50/50 midterm and final and practice versions and the same as the real test.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2009<br>Class Name: MAT151<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Soft spoken and hard to understand, but a really nice guy.  I'm usually a B student in math but the only points are from class group work (so easy) and the final (curved!). He gives a practice final nearly identical to the real thing. Besides studying for the final I did no work in this class and got a 97.5%. Taking him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>extremely hard to understand. You have to kind of study on your own and read the book (which is easy to read). He is an easy professor though, tests easy and greades easy. If you are a self starter, this is an easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2008<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really horrible teacher. All of his notes are copied directly from the book. It's ok to walk out of class at will or better yet...just dont bother showing up;he won't teach you anything anyway. If you don't want to learn a thing I highly suggest enrolling in his class. And the final is worth 50%, which is unheard of.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2008<br>Class Name: MAT13O<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very hard to understand, I never got used to his accent. During lectures, he's very unhelpful especially because he mumbles, but during group work he is able to answer any of your questions. He's very easy!! Although the sample final is nothing like what we've learned in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2008<br>Class Name: MAT260<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I never got used to his thick accent, and I had a hard time following the lectures as a result. He gave review packets before the midterm and final; the midterm study guide was helpful and nearly identical to the test, but the final wasn't even close to what we spent the most time on in class. I managed to pull off a B+. Good luck.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2007<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy, but has a heavy accent and mumbles to the floor during lectures.  Can't really understand him let alone stay awake.  If you take him I suggest sitting in the front.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/25/2007<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Stokolos means well, but is very difficult to follow. He does mumble, is hard to understand, and will talk to the board the entire time he writes a problem. You will spend the entire class struggling to copy what he writes on the board, failing to understand it in your hurry. His tests are very easy after you learn the short study guide.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/25/2007<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stokolos is hard to understand, but his tests are really really easy. The test and study guide are the same but with different variables. The average on the final was 91%, I got an A in his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2007<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Stokolos is by far the most supportive and understanding professor at DePaul. He has helped me several times one-on-one/email/phone.  He provides sample exams, which are great study guides for actual tests. No matter how much you're struggling, he will always want to help.  One of the nicest professors at DePaul...no exaggeration.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2006<br>Class Name: MAT150151152<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him for Calc I, II, & III. He has an accent as is soft-spoken, but you'll get used to it. He's a good guy and cares about his students. If you need help just ask him. He doesnt care about attendance so if you know the stuff you dont need to go. Your grade is 50% Midterm, 50% Final. Homework is optional but it helps boost your grade a little.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: QR<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think English was his uhhh 7th language..Painfully boring, lecture days I used as a study hall.

Very accomodating if you communicate with him. Explains things better one on one - class is kind of a waste unless there is a project. Grades midterm and final very easy and lets you put formulas on the board. One of my few recommended math profs!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2006<br>Class Name: MAT151<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Make sure you go to classes and take notes of his examples. Easy class if you try, do your homework, and go to class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2006<br>Class Name: MAT151<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a very nice man but a terrible teacher.  He grades like they do in Europe.  There is just the midterm and final and that's it.  If you have trouble with math, do not take him.  He is very unclear and goes over examples and proofs from the book and that's it.  You are basically on your own with this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2006<br>Class Name: MAT260261<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy, but not a good teacher hard to follow hard to understand and he has the worst teaching methods ever you will get an A in his class cause it is easy but if you learned anything you are lucky</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2005<br>Class Name: MAT260MULTIV<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Classes are extremely boring, when he discusses examples from the book for hours.  His tests are fair, and he is a generous grader.  Group activities count for 40% of final grade.  I would recommend taking him if you want to get a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's hard to understand and a little on the boring side BUT he really tries to humor his students.  Dr. Stokolos is really a sweet guy and willing to help his students out.  I'd only recommend him during the day or after a pot of espresso, though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His class is super easy, mostly just analyzing graphs and using critical thinking to analyze them.  I didn't learn any math skills, but I did learn how to use Excel which is a plus.  Also, he's very hard to understand but is also helpful when we do our in-class activities.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2005<br>Class Name: MAT147149<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Prof!Sooo happy I stayed with him throughout the calc series.I NEVER would have passed if taken with anyone else.I highly recommend him for Calc.   Don't get thrown off by his accent...you get use to it.So helpful if you ask questions.He tries eveything in his power to pass you, even hands you the midterm and final on a silver platter!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2005<br>Class Name: MAT152<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is awesome!!!

He really tries to help the class. He'll always make some funny joke or umm interesting metaphor. The chain rule consists of tomatoes and cucumbers. lol. Anyways, even though the class was a 2 hour 8:30 class I really did not mind going to class. Nice guy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2005<br>Class Name: MAT147149<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy! heavy accent but you get use to it after the 3rd day.  doesn't grade homework but would be wise to do it, really helps during the midterm and final.  Does 4 classroom assignments worth 40% total.  Those really help out in the end when it comes to your final grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really easy grader. SUPER BORING though (be thankful you'll only have to be in class like once a week). Doesn't really care if you talk during the final/midterm.Project sucks but all ISP 120 classes have to do it. Has a very heavy accent, so really hard to understand. Semi-easy A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2005<br>Class Name: MAT148<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I heart Prof. Stok-a-lok-a-ding-dong!  Now, I actually enjoy calculus.  Class can be long (its 2hrs), but we get &quot;10 minutes break&quot; in between which thankfully lasts 30 minutes. Homework is optional, but you have to do it to pass; final and midterm are worth 60% total. Stoks is helpful and nice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>you don't really need a professor for this class, but take it with him b/c he's a super easy grader. just be prepared to be bored during his lectures. he tends to go off subject A LOT.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very easy! but doesn't know what he is doing!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2005<br>Class Name: CALCIII<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>best calc teacher i had and i despise calculus! i learned most from him, tests and quizzes are easy, if he sees that you are putting effort he will help you a lot</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's a nice guy that tries to  help if you ask.

All anyone really needs to do is take notes from the board, since the boo doesn't explain it that well, and thewy should be fine.

Hes smart and funny.  Doesnt collect homework, but you have to do it otherwise you cannot do well on midterm and final (worth 60%).  Always willing to help, excruciatingly lame (but funny jokes).
