You'll either really like him or really dislike him. I thought he was a cool guy, but his pwrpts were hard to take notes from. You can easily get an A in the class, even if you don't do great on the quizzes (there are 5, no tests).

The most fun I've had in a Bio class ever.  The exams are straight from his notes so TAKE GOOD NOTES.

I had no real interest in biology before Bio 155, yet it was entertaining and fun.  I actually learned something about the way the world works.

This can be an easy course, but if you enjoy learning, you will be able to learn something as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/06/2007<br>Class Name: BIO102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Anth was da Bomb.

I did all the homework and went to every class.  There were never more than 10 questions on the tests from the assigned book & his lectures consisted of jokes and off-topic points.

The tests seem to focus on random parts of the lecture and the class average is in the C range for a test that seems like it will be simple.

His exams go all over the place and are not a good reflection of material covered in class. Disorganized as well. He is not approachable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/21/2004<br>Class Name: BIO215<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a very good professor, his exams weren't a fair representation of material covered in class. Better as a lab instructor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2004<br>Class Name: BIO103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For what he was teaching-Plants-he did an ok job. Lectures were boring, but mostly cuz the info was not too exciting. Just read the book for stuff you don't get and TRY to pay attention & u'll be fine. Tests were kinda hard, but he curves tremendously.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2004<br>Class Name: BIO215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He makes going to lab fun. Makes jokes, keeps you with him during lecture no matter what the material is.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2004<br>Class Name: BIO103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I only had him for the first four weeks for plant biology, which is pretty boring. Powerpoint ok, couldn't remember what to teach when it didn't work once. Still young, so he needs more practice. Test was ok-huge curve.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2004<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The easiest science class ever!I got an A and I didnt even buy the book!His tests were kinda hard but the labs were easy(we got to go to the L.P. Zoo for a couple)Just take good notes from his ppt lectures. He's a cool good-looking guy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2004<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought he was a pretty cool guy.  I didn't do spectacular on the tests, but I still pulled off an A somehow.  Letures can be kinda boring, but he's funny.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2004<br>Class Name: BIO215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Anthony was a great professor and not too bad on the eyes either. All of the labs were out in the field where Ecology takes place. He was really understanding and let me take the final after break b/c of my train. I recommend him to anyone!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2004<br>Class Name: BIO115<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>4 tests, some quizzes. teaches class with a powerpoint presentation. tests aren't fair - they don't cover the material well, only certain parts of the material. unless youre really good in this subject, don't take him. i wish i didnt.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2004<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an awesome professor. His test can be hard but if you do your work, you'll be fine. he is a resonable guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2004<br>Class Name: BIO115<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>just lectures,doesn't clarify procedures and information</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2003<br>Class Name: ECOLOGY<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I feel like the professor didn't really know what he was talking about. I found that the labs did not work well with the material and he was often given to advertising for local businesses in front of class instead of instructing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2003<br>Class Name: BIO215<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is young, hot, and passionate about the subject matter and makes the class an enjoyable one.  However, his tests are all about applying the material to the real world.  I'm a student with a high GPA and I got a &quot;C&quot; overall in the class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2003<br>Class Name: BIO215<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teacher is HOT!!!  I hate his exams though.  I would be better if the exam were straight forward instead of being on how to apply the material to real life experiences.  Other than that the course is cool.</div></div></div></body></html>
