Great lectures, fair tests, and practical assignments. Very nice personality. If you will make reasonable effort, you will do great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2012<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Aguirgre-Urreta is awesome. He is one of the few teachers at DePaul that actually "teach" instead of just reading slides. Lots of reading and casework will keep you engaged. No exams but TONS of busy work. I took it over the summer and it was very time consuming. Hes a great professor and a good guy. You definately have to earn this one.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2012<br>Class Name: ACC535<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Aguirgre-Urreta is awesome. He is one of the few teachers at DePaul that actually "teach" instead of just reading slides. Lots of reading and casework will keep you engaged. Two exams cover quite alot of material and make up about 50% of the grade. Keep up with the reading and cases and you will do well in his class. He really cares.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2011<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent instructor. With the case studies, and discussions in class, he made me interested in this subject I was not interested in before. Highly recommend this class with prof. Miguel!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2011<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.  Tries his best to keep the class interesting with case studies and how the topic relates to us.  No mid-term or final.  Weekly quizzes, bi weekly analysis of a current IT development and one presentation.  You'll get an A if you put forth some effort.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2011<br>Class Name: ACC610<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher and great class!!

Provides a few too many cases studies but information is interesting and he keeps the class moving along.

It didn't help that he constantly read off the PPT slides either.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2010<br>Class Name: ACCT201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice teacher, he knows a lot!

Just make sure you read all the chapters before studying and you will do fine on the tests. You have to do a group presentation but just make sure your topic is interesting</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2009<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is probably one of the worst professors I've taken at DePaul so far. Avoid taking him, if possible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2009<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I wouldn't say the worst, but try to have someone else if you have options, if not, don't sweat it. Again, he's not a disaster!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2009<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have one advice for ya, KEEP AWAY!! Too sturdy. all he does is reading from the author slides ruining what should be one of the most interesting classes. MIS is my  major and he definitely throws me off the subject. In addition to that, he's got a thick accent which makes it really hard to understand what he's saying.</div></div></div></body></html>
