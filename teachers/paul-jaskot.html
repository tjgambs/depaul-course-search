You won't pass the class if you don't pay attention and take really good notes. The texts and readings enhance his lectures. Uses a slide format but keeps your attention. Very helpful if you make an effort. He's very passionate about the subject. Best class I've taken at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/04/2011<br>Class Name: HAA240<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really good professor, he really knows his Art history. You have no choice but to pay attention in class and do the readings because he will call on you. He likes when you engage him and it will save you from a pop quiz. He gives those if no one answers his questions about the readings. Don't let that scare you he is helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2011<br>Class Name: HAA281<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Jaskot is honestly one of the best teachers at DePaul. I wasn't very informed about architecture before taking his class, but I went to his office hours and he was very helpful. Although he makes you work for your grade his expectations are very clear and as long as you work hard you should be able to get the grade you want.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2011<br>Class Name: HAA281<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT CLASS. If you are a student at DPU definitely take History of Modern Architecture. I learned so much about history and art. Very interesting, and relevant. This class will literally help you understand the world around you. 1 vocab quiz, midterm, 6 page paper and final. Not too hard, just stay up on your work. Lots of reading  but &quot;required&quot;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2010<br>Class Name: HAA280<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Jaskot was an awesome teacher. He made the lectures interesting. I'm not an architecture or history major but I felt like I actually learned a lot and was interested in what he had to say. He makes jokes and that helps the lecture too because its a lot of info in one sitting. He is tough and expects a lot from his students so go to every class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2010<br>Class Name: HAA363N<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not so hard, really.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2010<br>Class Name: HAA280<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Jaskot is an AMAZING teacher. I was not interested in the topic of art history at all before I enrolled in his class. He is such a great teacher, that it became my favorite class. Do not miss any classes. The text book is more background but where you learn and what is important is in the class room.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2010<br>Class Name: HAA280<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Paul is a wonderful human being.  He is genuinely excited and engaged during all of his lectures, and does not settle for one-word answers during discussions.  he likes to say, &quot;I don't believe you.. convince me...&quot; which makes the students actually think analytically and be critical.I HIGHLY recommend taking any of his classes</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2010<br>Class Name: ART356<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Jaskot is terrific, there's no other word.  If you want to learn take one of his classes, he honestly makes you feel like you're at Harvard.  Also make sure to take notes he is very thorough and definitely knows his stuff, also don't miss  class as his is not a blowoff class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>makes the class challenging, lectures are interesting, he is a very cool and smart man, although you do actually have to work hard to get a good grade</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/29/2008<br>Class Name: ART356<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>wonderful, charismatic, funny, intelligent...you gotta love him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2007<br>Class Name: HON205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Jaskot is extremely knowledgeable and approachable about the topic.  The coursework was extremely interesting.  Lectures got a bit boring sometimes, but hey, I prefer discussion-based courses.  Not an easy A, but an easy B if you show up and pay attention. Would definitely recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2007<br>Class Name: HON205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I worship this man.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2005<br>Class Name: ART238<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Jaskot is wonderful!  He certainly challenges students, but he is very willing to help students with their papers.  Prof. Jaskot's lectures are great.  (I actually almost cried once, it was so beautiful!)  Recommended for non-art majors and art majors alike.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2004<br>Class Name: ART397HOLOCAU<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Paul is an excellent professor with thourough lectures and well-argued new perspectives on topics you thought you already knew.
