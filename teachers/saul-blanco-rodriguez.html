His class lectures are extremely informative. He is also really good with communication outside of class, especially office hours. The homework and quizzes were fair for the most part. Although Discrete Math with him is by no means easy, Saul knows how to make it fun and engaging.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2013<br>Class Name: MAT140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Has a thick accent, so it can be hard to understand him at times. He is very helpful, and will do his best to give you assistance if you need it. Coursework is challenging but fair, and he has a good sense of humor as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2012<br>Class Name: MATH135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It was a nice class. His sense of humor is a bit strange sometimes, but his lectures are easy to follow and is always available to answer questions. If you do the work, you'll do great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2012<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>not my favorite teacher but willing to work with you</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2012<br>Class Name: MATH140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He will give worksheets every day as supposed to a lot of examples in class. It took some getting used to, but I ended up liking his way of teaching. Lectures were fun and he was available for extra help and answered emails quickly. Overall, a great class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2012<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's extremely helpful and willing to explain the material. I hadn't taken calculus before, so I needed a lot of help and he was always available. His lectures were easy to follow. The course requires a lot of work, but his exams are fair. I would take another class with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2012<br>Class Name: MATH135<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His English is not bad but he expects you to understand material without it being covered in depth.  If you struggle with math at all go with another teacher. He will respond to emails but may not answer the questions you have.  The book is expensive and you will need it or will fail.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2012<br>Class Name: MATH135<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He simplifies everything. Almost too much, actually. Extremely easy course with this teacher if you have taken calculus before. He is inadvertently funny. I would choose him over other calculus teachers any day.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2012<br>Class Name: MAT140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class requires work, but you will learn a lot from it, whether or not you like math. He is a good teacher, but you will not do well unless you attend every class. He will generally give you a good grade as long as you do well on HW quizzes, attempt the reading quizzes, and come to class every day.</div></div></div></body></html>
