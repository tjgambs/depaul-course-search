Everything on the quizzes is different from the homework and worst of all i feel like he tries to throw people off. The best an average student would be able to do is survive and get a C - but other then that dont take him. i now have to take the class again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2015<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prepare to teach yourself everything for this class.

Explains the material in a clearest possible manner. Quiz every class from previous class material. He grades the quizzes and provides with grades the same day or latest next morning. Very helpful outside the class.  I would absolutely take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/22/2012<br>Class Name: MATH136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! Crystal clear explanation. Very helpful in and outside of class. The homework is not mandatory, but I highly recommend you to do it even if you think you know the material. It will pay back in quizzes and exams, since they are all from homework problems. Take his course!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2012<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is horrible. He doesn't properly communicate himself. His tests are nothing compared to what he goes over. And he just doesn't care about your grade. In other words this teacher is a weiner.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2012<br>Class Name: CALC901<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a good teacher and really likes helping you out, but his quizzes and midterms are beyond hard. They are twice as hard as the homework and it takes almost 30-45 minutes just to do 3 problems. He is a very very helpful teacher and he thinks everyone in class understands it but after every class students get disappointed and discouraged.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2012<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Business Calculus with him was easy, he took test/final questions on the test...he took them from the book. Offers alot of out of class help for students who are bad at math.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2012<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very helpful and explains everything really well. We had one quiz each week related to the prior week's homework and will drop lowest quiz. Final is cummulative, but overall if you know the material it will not be difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2011<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy to understand what this man is saying. Quizzes are not that bad if you do your homework.  You don't have to take the final if you have over 100 in the class. Great teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2011<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really good teacher and knows what is up when it comes to Calc. He always let us out early and if you get a high grade you do not have to take the final. He is kind of a scary guy but is really cool and will answer any questions you have. Take him. You will learn a lot of calc and get a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2010<br>Class Name: STATS103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ah-mazing &lt;3</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2010<br>Class Name: STATS103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took him for Calc, where it was way easier. Only reason why I gave him a 3 is because the final is cumulative and pretty hard. The quizzes are easy and I've heard there were harder Stats teachers. He's very helpful. Very clear it's just the final is cumulative so it's easy to mix things up, so that loses a point. Take him for calc, maybe for stats.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2010<br>Class Name: CALC135<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Curved quizes and exams. Homework not required. Crystal clear explanations. This isn't an exactly blow off class, you do have to work if you're not very good at math. The best part of all is that he usually lets you out 30-60 minutes before the class ends. I'd say take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2010<br>Class Name: STATS136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor. He is very confident in what he is talking about and will even give you his cell and wouldn't mind you calling him for questions.  is, he gives you based on your work. One thing though, make sure you dont ask dumb questions. He will point you out and make you feel stupid. He is a very intimidating guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2009<br>Class Name: MATH094<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>really nice guy. straight forward, no surprises. all the homework was online and there was a quiz every week. always welcome to answer any questions and to call him outside of class to ask questions. i highly recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2009<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great math teacher.weekly quizes if you do hw you will do ok midterm and final.

Hands down. He doesn't try to trick you and everything is straight forward. Weekly quizes, midterm and final. Homework is not collected.

Hes a great teacher and very helpful, he even gives you his number to call for any help, how many teachers do that&#63;  He tells you what to study for quizzes and finals, curves and gives partial credit even if the answer is wrong, cant get any better.

Very fair in grading and doesn't collect the homework.  The key to the success in his class is to do what we all hate, which is homework.  If you do the homework, you will do just fine on the weekly quizzes.  He explains the material thoroughly and with clarity.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2006<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors.  really enthusiastic about the subject, very clear in his lectures, and always willing to help.  6 quizes, Midterm, and Final.  DO THE HOMEWORK because his quizes and tests are pretty much all the problems from the homework, and there will be no surprises.  Also, a very fair grader. I would definately recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2006<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Teacher but challanges the way you think.   He is really nice and cool to talk to.  Calc is a hard class and he makes you think.  Just go to class, PAY ATTENTION, and youll do ok on the quizzes.  Just make sure you take your time, his questions are tricky.  He drops the lowest quiz and encourages you to ask for help.  Def.  take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2006<br>Class Name: BMS125902<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class consists of &gt; (6) quizzes, 30 pts each from which your lowest is dropped. &gt;&gt; (1) Mid-Term in class that is 100 pts & (1) Comprehensive Exam worth 150 pts (only from chap 3-5). He is a great teacher...Very helpful and if you study the notes, you do not need to do homework!! the quizzes/tests are directly from questions on notes.

There only two exams in his class which is the midterm and final. He does not collect homework, but you have to do it anyways to understand the materials. If you mess up on one exam then thats it for you. Since he does not collect homework, you are actually losing some free points to improve your grade. I recommend you </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.

He's very comprehensive and is always very responsive to questions.  He's the best teacher I have ever had!  He'll even meet up with you at a coffee house to help you with your homework or studying.

He isn't nitpicky at all on quizzes, and doesn't stress the homework, although you're better off doing it.
