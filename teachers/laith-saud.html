This is my second time having him & I still love coming to his class just because his lectures are so eye opening and hilarious! He relates lessons with his own personal experiences!If you haven't taken him, you're def. missing out! I would 100% recommend him for any of his classes!! #ILoveLaith </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2015<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Love this guy. Simply put, amazing, inspirational, and hysterical. His lectures are eye-opening and simply great. Definitely recommend him for any class! Check Benedictine University's library, they have the book in a pdf for free.  #LaithForPresident</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2014<br>Class Name: REL263<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Laith is, simply put, a badass. Everything else you've read about him being an Easy A and being super smart is all true. Show up to class, engage in intellectual discussions, do minimal reading, write a good final paper, respect Laith, and you'll do great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2014<br>Class Name: REL263<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's perfect......

Just a midterm and a final group debate/paper. The class was about Islamic culture yet I really don't remember much about that at all. My final debate was on capitalism. He's really chill and the class is an easy A. He cancels every now and then too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2014<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Anyone who thinks Professor Saud is arrogant is clearly insecure and jealous of the man's charisma. The class seems easy because Professor Saud knows how to lecture and keep his students engaged in a discussion that's enlightening and refreshing. Take his class, he's by far the best professor I've had at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2012<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Basically what everyone's been saying his an awesome teacher that puts a new spin on things, take him asap</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2012<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Le best! He makes you think a lot about religions, the world and even yourself. A couple of short papers and a final group project.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2011<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>In addition to all the comments about an easy A ( which is true) the professor is one of the most knowledgeable and intellectual professors I have come across. Great guy to talk to outside of class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2010<br>Class Name: REL264<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My roommates told me to take him because it was a guaranteed A. And it's true, this guy gives good grades just to please students. He tries to make Islam look trendy even though it's a Religion. He clearly bases grades off who he likes.  I'm Muslim and did all my work well and he gave me an A- when I deserved an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2010<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>VERY INTERESTING, this guy is always making sure his class is participating and involved with the class debate, class is a breeze and easy A, will definitely take him again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2010<br>Class Name: IWS263<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Make a long story short; coolest teacher ever.

Very professional and knowledgeable. Clear speaker and very cool, down to earth. Professor Saud does not believe in grades, so if you want a class where you'll learn alot and still pass pretty easily, take his class!!</div></div></div></body></html>
