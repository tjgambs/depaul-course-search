She is helpful and she works with you. I had a rocky AQ and I missed class a lot , but I communicated my issues to her and she went out of her way to help me stay on track. She understands if things come up just TELL HER! The class was boring but I would rather take it with an amazing prof like her. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2014<br>Class Name: HLTH201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing professor. She does not repeat what's off powerpoints and explains it in her own words and lectures about interesting things. She is very knowledgeable in her subject. Great attitude, always there to answer questions after lectures. Midterm and finals is a written exam and requires you know the material. No textbook! Just PDFs on D2l  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2014<br>Class Name: HLTH201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Jerome runs a fairly interactive class. Always attempts to communicate WITH the students instead of talking to them. Class can be somewhat boring once in awhile, but the topics she covers are interesting for the most part. She is organized as well. And also  allows students to make up points easily.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2014<br>Class Name: HLTH229<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Dr. Jerome! Night classes suck and I used to make up excuses not to go to them but not with Dr. Jerome's class! The material she presented was so interesting. Readings every week, all on D2L. A short presentation on an article. Fair grader. Worksheets every class so you'd probably have to go not to miss out on points.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2013<br>Class Name: HLTH380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would recommend all the health science major to take her!!! She is ready to help you anytime!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2012<br>Class Name: HLTH201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Jerome is amazing. She is very clear and gives direct information that you have to know for the midterm and final. Some reading, but its not anything to drastic. In addition, you have one group project that is an easy A if you just follow the directions. Midterm and the final are the only tests. Can easily get over 100%!</div></div></div></body></html>
