I took her last quarter for Acc 101 and this quarter for Acc 102. Accounting is not the easiest class for many students, I can see that. However, she does her best in helping students to pass.

She does want her students to do well and is always willing to help.  To be successful in this course, which I learned, is that YOU MUST ASK QUESTIONS ON STUFF YOU ARE CONFUSED WITH.  She will go more in detail if you ask questions, and will do so during office hours.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2010<br>Class Name: ACCT102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very nice, helpful, and pleasant.  There seems to be a disconnect in the class however.  I don't find her lectures to be very clear and struggle because of it.  She does ask if everyone understands, but doesn't modify her teaching style when we don't.  It's hard to dislike her because she seems to genuinely want her students to do well and is likeable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2010<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>How this teacher has negative comments is beyond me. Really sweet lady, cares about her students, and is lenient on grading. She's disorganized at all, powerpoints each class and explains everything thoroughly. But, just like any other class, it does require effort on the student's part. Take her, if the opportunity presents itself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She can't teach in my opinion.

Her powerpoints and notes do not help with the homework at all! She does not prepare you well enough for the midterm or final. Everyone did pretty bad and she does not curve. One time we had a substitute and she made everything Wendorf taught a lot easier to understand. Take a different professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2009<br>Class Name: ACC100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At the beginning she was helpful but after Chapter 3 she was always rushed to finish the lecture; we were always behind in class. She gives you notes, you might think thats a plus, but they werent helpful. Her online quizzes suck!Everybody in class had to read the whole book numerous times in order to understand the material.Not helpful at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2009<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT TEACHER!!! If you dont get something ask her she will explain it to you until you get it. Good amount of homework which is useful. If you want to do good sit in the front and really pay attention.

Its just a hard topic. In the beginning she was helpful and timely but in the end she got quick and never returned things on time. You need the book.

It's definitely possible to get an A but be prepared to work hard. The classes and powerpoints are NOT helpful!  I ended up teaching myself through the book and from eduspace. Lot's of guess and check with eduspace. Midterm and final were really hard. The lab does boost your grade though! I do not recommend this professor!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2009<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am assuming all the negitive grades are from one person only who might have suck at accounting him/her self.. not the professor fault!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2009<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an amazing professor. I don't agree with the comments below. I think she is great , her class is not boring like other accounting class , makes jokes and like to have fun. She puts her full effort in teaching and try to get us through.the quizes and home work is all online and can be checked b4 submitting , that a straight 50% of ur grade!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT again DO NOT take Professor Wendorf!!!! Her class consists of Power Points for each Chapter.. and these power points are such BS.. they don't even highlight the main points of the chapter!  You basically end up teaching your self how to do all the problems.  If you take her then expect to learn on your own through eduspace!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2009<br>Class Name: ACCT101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For an intro to Accounting class I would take a different teacher. She is condescending and at times rude. She gives you quizzes and homework due the day of the midterm and the final. Doesn't really curve is very unorganized. If you go to her office she makes you feel stupid. Some of the other professors have much higher reviews, take them</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2009<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tries to be funny but that doesnt work for her! Dont bother going to her office or asking her for help, she'll either tell you that you should know the answer by now or she'll just leave you more confused. Waits till like a week before the final to put up the slides on  blackboard & assigns hw and a quiz right before the final. Avoid her if u can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2009<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take mickey; she is very unorganized and doesn't take a great effort in seeing her students succede.

Incredibly unorganized! I cannot believe that anyone in the real world will respect her. She makes too many mistakes and gives a lame explanation to cover it up.

She tends to keep things pretty plain and simple so its easy to understand. Homework is modest and not to hard. Test aren't to hard either. As long as you pay attention in class and do the HW you will be fine. She also posts all of the notes on Blackboard so you don't really have to take any notes yourself which is nice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2008<br>Class Name: ACC300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The subject is not exciting.  Really cares about what you learn.  If you do what you're supposed to, the class isn't too hard.  She gives you alot of stuff on Blackboard to help study.  SUA was intense, but helpful.  Don't know what class some of these reviewers were going to -- she covers the SUA in class and I got help online and in her office.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2008<br>Class Name: ACC300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mickey is a kook! Very pleasant teacher and knows her stuff well. The material is basic common sense but the tests are way harder.

She has no real world experience and is VERY unorganized! Her lectures consist of her reading the slides, as college students we know how to read. Wasted our money and time.

Good luck.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2005<br>Class Name: ACC300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easiest ACC class ever, though boring.  I haven't studied once, did the SUA the night before due and doodled during lectures, still got an A.  Her jokes aren't funny but you can rip on her and she laughs with you.

I had Murphy for acc 101 and she was harder. Wendorf at least goes through the homework and she puts notes up on blackboard. Accounting is a hard subject and it is difficult to grasp, if you are failing or doing bad maybe it accounting is not your thing and most of the teachers are not easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE. She is very obnoxious.  Makes things that are quite simple ideas (once I learned them on my own from the book) very unclear and hard to understand.  Her quizes are like riddles.  She never has any answers for you when you ask a question, just leaves you more confused.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is one of the ten hardest courses according to DePaul.

She is the worst teacher EVER. Don't let her niceness fool you. She is extremely disorganized, unprepared for class, and tells the corniest jokes.
