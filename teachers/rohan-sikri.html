If you want to doze off take his class. He is difficult to pay attention to, was always 5 minutes late and held out class for an extra minute or two every day. If you want a class that is easy and a waste of time, take it. Cool subject, but boring professor. I have never watched the clock so much.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2012<br>Class Name: PHILO100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Rohan is a first rate lecturer. DePaul should be saddened by his leave. If you're not intrigued by his unique command of the english language, read a bit more literature. I can only hope the rest of my philosophy teachers will captivate me as he did.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Even though he's so monotone he's a really great guy. I loved when his wife would come in and they would double lecture. He assigns a lot of readings but the mid-term/final are open book/note, so if  you read, you're golden. He is a super easy grade & loves students that participate in discussion. I would recommended him, just do the readings</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2012<br>Class Name: A317<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought he was super interesting and gave a plethora of insights from different views. You will not get by if you do not read but honestly i loved all the readings, they were never boring. But i love philosophy. I think it is a great class and should be required by all students to open their mind and learn to understand everyone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sikri assigns work, but then takes forever to grade it. His lectures can be monotone and drains a student's energy level. He seems very narrow-minded, and perceived the students to lack intelligence. He takes a LSP 200 class way to seriously, I understand it's college, but this is a general requirement, not a class someone takes for their core work</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2011<br>Class Name: PHL287<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought the class was extremely interesting, but Professor Sikri was difficult to follow at times. He has a tendency to seem a bit standoffish, but he's very helpful outside of class. He definitely knows what he's talking about, and he will make you think!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2011<br>Class Name: PHIL000<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy.

He'll give redo for first paper+will read papers if send in before deadline</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/25/2010<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he does speak in an extremely sophisticated manner losing my attention often. a bit boring. he lectures. no slides just speaks. you really don't have to read just take notes on his lectures and you'll be fine. the book can be taken out of the library. he is monotone. he seems like a nice guy and helpful if u ask questions</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2010<br>Class Name: PHL247<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid if you can !</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2010<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's a cool guy, very laid back and helpful when you ask.  but he does talk with a VERY sophisticated vocab and isn't the easiest to follow.  he's pretty monotone too.  the class itself was pretty boring, i remember nearly falling asleep a few times.  the midterm and final essays will take awhile...but he will help you a lot with them if you ask.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2010<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is really great, but do not take him at 8:30 in the morning.Will ask you to write essays for your midterm and final but grades VERY fairly!Even offers essay revisions before you turn in your papers! Weekly quizes which are straightforward. Honestly he is a really helpful professor plus he has the coolest accent ever!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2010<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE IT. IT IS BAD FOR YOU AND YOU GPA.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2010<br>Class Name: PHIL248<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was guy who taught from the book but expounded on the reading. spoke to you in a manner that made you feel right where you were supposed to be, not condescendingly. expected participation to get things moving but at 8:30 am no one was fired, sometimes neither was he. He is pretty flexible and understanding.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2010<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you like listening to people who talk with an unreasonably sophisticated vocab and who pretend they are teaching at Harvard then this is the guy for you. Class material is one of great pertinence and interest, but his dull personality ruins this.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2010<br>Class Name: PHL247<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Sikri knows his material backwards and forwards, and has a well-deserved ego about it. Zero discussion, zero class participation, fascinating readings, interesting lectures, broad essays, and occasional snarky quips about idiotic students are what make up the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2010<br>Class Name: PHL247<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you like monotonous, drawn-out lectures, then this is the class for you.  It is pure lecture.  No discussions or class interaction.  If there are ever films, they are boring as well. Don't take this class. Attendance is mandatory.</div></div></div></body></html>
