Make sure to take notes and the two papers will come soo easy!  She was great to listen to and I loved her lectures!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/29/2010<br>Class Name: PHILO101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I like her. She's probably my favorite professor at DePaul. Her class is not a class you can just show up to, not pay attention, and expect to pass. Which is why I think people don't like her. She's very quirky, almost awkward, but you can tell inconceivably intelligent. I find her very funny and engaging.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2009<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved her class. She is funny, sometimes odd, and tries really hard to get her point across. Asking her for help was not hard, and she was willing to. An easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very nice and funny. Her class is so easy. If you just take notes the essays will write themselves and she is definitely not a hard grader. You do not have to show up for class she does not take attendance and she gives you an A for participation at the end of the class even if you didnt say anything</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2008<br>Class Name: PHL103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very unclear teacher. spends too much time dancing around topics. Seems to change her mind and not answer questions; disreguards questions. Should not be teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2008<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's only unclear if you don't do the readings. If you do the readings, then she's not unclear at all!! She's quirky and funny and knows the stuff well and will answer any questions you have. Also, go and see her while writing the papers, she'll help you out a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2008<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is quirky and funny bit can at times be unclear. If you take notes on what she says in class the 2 papers will write themselves. She negotiates with the class and is understanding. Participate in class and you will be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2008<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the worst teacher I have ever had, she is not clear at all about things she says and I don't even think she even knows what she's talking about.  She does not care if you show up to class, is very bias and sometimes cancels class because a few people don't show up.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2008<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a devoted and caring teacher but tends, on occaision, to make the material unclear.  However, she never fails to make herself available to her students should they have concerns or require extra help.  Lectures and the readings are crucial.  Midterm and Final come right from class notes.  No surprises.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2008<br>Class Name: PHL200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>avoid her shes soo boring everyone in class falls asleep for atleast one point during class. also heis not very helpful and didnt really care about our class she was rude to students if we wanted help</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2008<br>Class Name: PHI248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have a lot of respect for this teacher.  She genuinely cares about her subject, and cares that the students understand it as well.  Classroom discussions are EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.  A lot of midterm/final material is taken directly from discussions and is not readily apparent in the texts.  Final paper 10 pgs and VERY challenging - start early!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2008<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She seems easy and nice but once you get your tests back, you will find out she's hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2008<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice woman.  Extremely QUIRKY!!!!  Lots of case studies,  Group Project, 10 Page Reseach Paper Plus Final and Midterm.  If you need to take a PHL class take her, but only if you dont mind lots of work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2007<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Robin is a sweet teacher and very knowledgeable in philosophy..reading assignments every week, 2 papers due throughout the semester, no tests/quizzes, just one final..make sure u take alot of notes in her class..do not recommend taking the 3 hr night class and dont skip class. she meets with her students and is very helpful</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2007<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She uses some difficult books yes, but if you take good notes the papers write themselves.  She has some interesting personality quirks...you'll see.  Final was a breeze. OH--AND DON'T PLAGIARIZE.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2007<br>Class Name: PHLSECT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>When she starts out on the first day of class with her &quot;THIS CLASS MIGHT NOT BE FOR YOU&quot; speech you may not want to come back.  Don't worry.  She is a great teached and she is definitely very into what she teaches.  There are two papers, and while they may be a pain to write she makes herself fully available if you should need help. Final was easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2007<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There are two papers, and they are just hard to start writing, and very long.  She is a funny lady, she really knows what she is talking about.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2007<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She may be nice and all, but i wouldnt take this class unless you're ready to read almost 100 pages every week and write papers too. One week it was 131 pages!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2007<br>Class Name: PHILO100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best/nicest teachers I have had DePaul.  Attendance isn't mandatory but I would still go to class.  She taught philosophy really well and I actually learned something but didn't need to spend a ridiculous amount of time doing work and preparing for the class.  She tells you what she expects from you so its pretty hard to not do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2007<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very nice, answers your e-mail, lectures well, requires quality papers, and does not take of points if your paper happens to be late. She encourages class discussions, but do not force it. It makes sense to go to her class because you learn a lot there.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2007<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's really nice and seems like she knows what shes talking about. If you go to class, take notes your papers should write themselves! 1st essay is about you, 2nd about two Philosophers final about another philosopher. I havent opened my book at all this quarter but i go to class and so far i have an A in her class. Trust me shes not hard, just go</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2007<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a great professor.  She is really into what she teaches, and you can tell by her lectures.  Two 8 page papers, and one final that was rather easy if you go to her finals review class prior to taking it.  I got an A and I never even open the books.  Just go to class, listen, and take notes, and you should be set.</div></div></div></body></html>
