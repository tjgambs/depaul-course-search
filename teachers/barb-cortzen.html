Had her for an entire year and she never once graded the homework.

Her accent really isn't that hard to understand.

She typically offers night classes and for calculus, be prepared for what you're getting yourself in to.  There are three cumulative tests in the quarter with an emphasis on what you just learned.   Tutors are given specifically for her class that help ALOT. One of the better math classes i took</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2011<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really funny and helpful. Most of the test questions come from old hw assignments, so as long as you keep up with the hw and know how to do every problem, you will do well. Your grade consists of two tests and the final but she will change the weight of one test to help your grade. She really wants every one of her students to do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/31/2011<br>Class Name: MAT148<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVED HER!

You have to put the work in. She is a great math teachers if you are willing to pay attention, take notes, do the homework, and ask questions. If you do not do one of these things you will struggle.

Our entire class struggles through her terrible 3 hours-twice a week-sequence. Shes awful, mean, flips if you dont understand a concept instead of just explaining it.

Easily the best math teacher at Depaul. She was very helpful and her tests were very easy. She basically took everything off her practice tests and put them on the test.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2009<br>Class Name: MAT147<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow.  I loved Bah-bah-wah- Her accent kept me so entertained and she is SO funny! Although funny,her accent is hard to understand.  I would definitely reccommend her.  The class isn't that hard, if you study and all the test questions come from the homework, and the pre-tests.  Overall good professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2008<br>Class Name: MAT147<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's hardheaded, but when you need her help she is there.  She's good at explaining things when you're confused on them and spends time on things that the class is having trouble with. I've never had such a good calculus teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2008<br>Class Name: MAT141<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her for a couple of math courses.  If you're majoring in Computer Science, you'll like Cortzen's classes.  She used to do programming, so her teaching style is quite technical.  She gives you a good deal of freedom in how you do math problems (just make sure to show your work), and her exams are very straightforward.  Strongly recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2008<br>Class Name: MAT152<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's somewhat of a fair grader but she takes away more points then she give if there's something wrong with the problem. Had her for MAT 150/151/152...used to love math now I hate it. She is not very understanding if you just don't understand something. Tries to help you out but usually useless.

I don't understand why homework doesn't count for anything. It doesn't seem fair to me. I'm usually pretty good at math but this class was really hard. Only about two tests and the final were taken into account for your final grade. thats ridiculous. I I've never gonna take another class with her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2008<br>Class Name: MAT151<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>grate profedssor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2007<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is a joke.  You can attend literally half of the classes and still pass. Quiz every week, pretty basic, most people leave afterwards, and she sometimes give points for staying.  Pretty nice overall, but sometimes doesn't know what she is talking about.  Oh yea, she loves her smoke breaks.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2007<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2007<br>Class Name: MAT152<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's probably the best option of all MAT 152 teachers. I had her or MAT 150/151/152 and she's a very fair grader. Like what others said, test problems directly off homework. Just do the homework and look it over before test. No surprises on exams and good prof. to take for average math students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2007<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good foundation in Calc class, but it is a bit all or nothing. My grade was compromised of 1 test, a midterm and a final. The tests are not hard, but in order to ace them you have to pay attention to detail and study rigorously. She explains material very well, though.  If you study the book, you will be fine. Recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2007<br>Class Name: MAT215<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr.Cortzen is a GREAT professor. The problem that some people have with her is that your grade is primarily based off 3 exams; you MUST do well on the final to pass/get a good grade. Doing well on the final + visiting the TA's office hours + class participation= a good grade!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2007<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Go to class. Take notes. Do your homework. Do the test reviews. Get A. Repeat. Three tests a quarter, all the problems right from the test reviews, right from the homework. It's not mandatory, but if you stay on top of your**** you should have no trouble getting an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2007<br>Class Name: MAT215<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Seriously, she is not what others are saying she is. I took her looking at what others said on here, now I am so regreting it. There is only midterm and final plus homework. If you ruin your mid term, like me, then you are bound to fail the class. please do not take her!

Then tests are based on homework (exact numbers)...so take notes in class, do homework, then test shouldnt be hard at all..a easy B if you attend class and pay attention.

When you ask her a question, she doesn't quite answer it directly. Your grade is only based on three tests which can really lower your grade. She lectures the entire time...

I was never very good at math and she totally changed that:) There was hw that was not graded but all the tests and the final were based off of the hw. Oh yeah, Participate because she tends to be more flexable when she grades</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2004<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Collects homework before tests, 2 tests and a final, final worth 40% of grade.

So you really don't have to do it. But on the other side, all tests are based on q-ns from hwk. So if you do your homework and understand what you were doing, you'll be ready for all the tests.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2003<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ms. Cortzen was such a great professor.  She knows what she is talking about and she is always there to help you.
