And sometimes the crap she says about technique is complete garbage (vowel shape especially!!!). But she's very nice and easy to work with if you're a girl and a vocalist.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2005<br>Class Name: CHOIR<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She doesn't teach choir anymore, she's just the accompanist and occasionally does woman's sectionals. She's obviously a great musician and a really sweet lady, but she doesn't really have the authority needed to direct a choir. She's ok with the women, but the men pay no attention to her at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2004<br>Class Name: MEN123<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Has NO idea how to direct a choir.  Does not belong in this field of music.  Most likely a wondeful solo teacher for piano/voice, but is clueless in terms of the choral ensemble.  Disgrace.</div></div></div></body></html>
