In this particular course, COMM 313, John Brooks fell flat of the standard expectations for a college level professor. His teaching style is out-dated and too old fashion. It is nice, however, that his tests (including the final) are taken online. Beware of absences</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2015<br>Class Name: 337<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Brooks was one of the hardest graders I've ever had at DePaul... He for some reason gave me a 410 for participation when I never skipped a class and I usually asked questions or commented in every class. He expects way too much of a full-time student. Would not take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2015<br>Class Name: PRAD337<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Rather not say</div><div id="right"><div>From a straight A student: he's horrible. Take home tests use trick questions & ask things that aren't in the book & aren't discussed in class. He expects u to make a PR plan but barely teaches ANYTHING & gives no rubric explaining what hes looking forhow hes grading. He acts pompous & grades harshly. I learned nothing. Waste of time and money!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2014<br>Class Name: PRAD291<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very nice guy and probably knowledgeable in his profession, but he also one of the worst professors ever. He is so vague and there is no clear answer on anything. He never uses the book and doesn't even touch on advertising...only pr. Everything is take home, but its extremely difficult to do well because he doesn't use lecture notes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2014<br>Class Name: PRAD291<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Only take this class if you are into PR - does not touch on advertising at all. Really not helpful when it came to research, pretty much didn't learn anything. But a nice guy with easy enough assignments if you read. Definitely boring when lecturing, but will let you out early. Always a plus.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2013<br>Class Name: PRAD337<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class wasnt hard take home tests, mid term and final but he is beyond VAGUE, UNCLEAR, UNHELPFUL about hw assignments, papers, and quizzes. Does not post grades online and when you actually do ask what it is you get an email with just a letter grade. Extremely boring. Not the worst but I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND TAKING CLASS WITH HIM.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2013<br>Class Name: PRAD337<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Most BORING man alive. Class is not hard, but it is still difficult to pull off a good grade because he is so VAGUE and UNCLEAR about what he wants/expects from assignments, papers, presentations etc. He will not give any grading criteria, barely explain anything and is a overly harsh grader. Not the worst but take a different prof if possible</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD255<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Only take this class if you're thinking about PR. Overall, it was super easy. Everything was take home and I didn't have one test/quiz to study for. The exam was open book. I ended up with an A. He's a clear teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVED his class.  Tough grader but I learned so much from him and class was so much fun!  Quizzes are take home and the final is open book.  Easily my favorite class taken thus far at DePaul.</div></div></div></body></html>
