Very funny and is willing to help any time.  Found out that he is gone when I stopped by his office for career advice.  Will miss him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2007<br>Class Name: SOC279<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's not everyday you see your professor on HBO but, one day I heard his voice in the livingroom, which freaked me out.  He is pretty cool and very clear.  He tells you what will be on the exams although they are still quite difficult.  He is far better than other professors who teach stats.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2007<br>Class Name: SOC279<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely clear and helpful. He explains things in a way that was very easy for me to understand. The class was really not that boring even though I thought it would be (because it's stats).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/17/2007<br>Class Name: SOC381<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dude!  He walked around the parking lot after our graduation to hand out flowers to his students.  This guy cares more than anybody I know in that department.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2007<br>Class Name: SOC279<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent Prof.!! good to work with and present the material clear for students to understand.  But you need to pay attention to the class otherwise you're going to be sorry.  Attendence is not required but if you miss class you're going to be lost. I really recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2006<br>Class Name: SOC279<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His lecture is entertaining for a obring topic.  He tries to be funny and tells a lot of stories.  It may not seem like it at the time but he covers a lot of material.  His exams are rather difficult but you'll learn a lot.  He is very excited about the topic and his sincerity makes him very cute.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2006<br>Class Name: SOC380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Brilliant...and cute too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2006<br>Class Name: SOC381<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>May not seem like it, but is actually a really cool guy. Very helpful if you ask for it and has lots of interesting sociological tidbits. I have to admit I did not like him at first but he's pretty cool.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2006<br>Class Name: SOC380381<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you haven't taken research methods, take him.  He's extremely knowledgable and helpful.  The class was not hard at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2005<br>Class Name: MATH242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm not a sociology major but after taking his class, I am seriously considering the major.  He makes statistics very real and practical.  But his tests aren't easy although it is open book & notes.  Worth a conversation with him about your career path.  Very difficult to get hold of him outside of Tues. evening office hours.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2005<br>Class Name: SOC495<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is simply Hot, Hard, and Helpful. I love this class! Everyone needs to go to his office hours because even though he is hard he really helps you learn about stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/23/2005<br>Class Name: STATSRESEARCH<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yes what they say is true.  Professor Kim peaked my intrest in research and even helped my attempts to get a job out of school.  You should take him up on his after class hrs at the bar.  He is very interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2005<br>Class Name: SOC379381<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not only is he extremely clear in class, he is even more helpful if you spend time with him one on one.  He helped me with the classes, and then found an internship for me afterwards.  He is the busiest professor in the department and yet he  spent hours talking to me about my career.  Be sure to go to his office hours on Lincoln Avenue.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2005<br>Class Name: SOC379381<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would not have graduated if it were not for Prof Kim.  His classes laid the necessary foundation for my Master's studies.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2005<br>Class Name: SOC379381<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Kim is a character...don't let him scare you too much. He's picky and demands a lot, but when you don't give him what he wants, he still gives you an A. MY PERSONAL ADVICE: Don't work with a group in 380-81. He'll help you a lot more if you work alone</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/10/2005<br>Class Name: SOC379<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice teacher, cares about students.

Take good notes and you will do fine on the tests b/c you can use your notes. Ask questions b/c he moves sort of quick.  He is helpful when you ask.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2004<br>Class Name: SOC379<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher!  I had him for a night class and we never stayed the whole time.  He said what he had to say and then we got to leave.  He makes his tests very easy and we got to use our notes.  He's a great guy, and I highly suggest him.</div></div></div></body></html>
