Not that this class is hard or has any quizzes or tests, but he is one of the few professors I have actually met at DePaul that truly cares about your future. TAKE HIM!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2014<br>Class Name: ORGC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Wayne is the MAN!
