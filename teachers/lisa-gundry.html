This passion comes through very clearly, and adds to the overall quality of the course.  It's fairly easy to get a good grade, and there are fun activities scheduled during class meetings.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2009<br>Class Name: MGT573<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's one of the nicest professor who always respect her student.

The class is fun and you can actually apply the techniques learned for personal and professional purposes. Very group discussion oriented. I recommend it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/01/2008<br>Class Name: MGT573<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tremendously fun class - she kept the energy level high and the assignments lively.  Introduced a slew of concepts, creativity tools, some of which will be more useful than others for each individual.  Fair grader and very open to student feedback and contributions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2007<br>Class Name: MGT537<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher I have had at Kellstadt.  She cares deeply about the material, and she helps the students to get excited about creativity.  Some of the work is difficult, but it is useful out side of class.  I would highly recommend this course and Dr. Gundry!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2006<br>Class Name: MGT573<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Creativity in Business was an exellent class to get any business student to start thinking outside the box.  At first I though it was going to be stupid, but Professor Gundry does a great job with outside speakers and in class assignments to really involve everyone in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2005<br>Class Name: MGT573<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is possibly the best professor at DePaul.  Her lectures are informative and lots of fun.  You learn things without knowing it.  There are a few papers, but they are well worth the effort as she is a rather generous grader.  She lets you know exaxtly what she is looking for.  Definetely an awesome teacher, take her class if you ever haveachance</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/02/2005<br>Class Name: NA<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the best teacher and friend a student could have.

Unfortunately she is also pretty boring. She is a fair grader, and the class expectations/assignments were clear. Very nice and helpful, just not the most captivating class. Participation counts</div></div></div></body></html>
