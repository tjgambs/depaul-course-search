Sometimes he gets a bit too excited and things aren't very clear. Make sure to read the book and attend lectures. The first 40 minutes of lecture were always a recap of the previous lecture. Friday discussions were not discussions, they were more lecture. However, he always answers questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2014<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Gilliland has a great sense of humor so lectures are always enjoyable. That being said, biology is tough with a lot of self-learning and it is CRITICAL that you keep up on reading and not cram the weekend before an exam. Make sure to complete the topic lists and use them as study guides for exams. Also, final grades are curved.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2014<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Without previous knowledge of bio this class would be impossible. Dr. G doesn't have time to re explain or take time on any subjects as he piles  a lot into each lecture. That is the nature of a college course though. Notes are taken for the entire lecture, every lecture. Hard-ish class but survivable. Attendance is taken.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2014<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Quirky guy, very approachable. He rushes through lectures, heforces the 17 chapter schedule on the syllabus. He gives study guides per chapter, and will base test questions off of it. Tests are hard whoever you take, but he will most probably curve. Take him and build a rapport with him if you want to work in research. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2013<br>Class Name: BIO260<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is dumb, He knows the material but doesn't explain it well. Will confuse you. Makes the exams and quiz super hard because its open note. Wouldnt take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2013<br>Class Name: BIO260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Gilliland is an amazing professor! I already loved genetics, but Dr. Gilliland made me love it more. Lectures are very interesting and he explains complex topics very well. Do not be fooled by his open note quizzes! If you do not know the material inside and out, notes will not help you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2012<br>Class Name: BIO260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very entertaining teacher.  Treats material like a puzzle to be solved, which I really liked.  Tests were extremely logic based (i.e. you can't just memorize the material).  However, all the exams (4) and final were OPEN note.  Easy A if you generally get A's... That being said I know some people really struggled</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2012<br>Class Name: BIO260<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think he is getting a little more credit than deserved. He does do a good job teaching his subject (I took Genetics) but he still has some room for critique. He is one of the better professors at DePaul but you still need to put the work in. He gives some wonderful resources online. Be prepared for a 10 page final with a topic per page.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2011<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an excellent lecturerer, using analogies. He also explains the material very well, but is fairly simplistic in lecture. Quizzes and tests are more difficult, and there is heavy use of the textbook in this course. Ask questions! He's very willing to help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2011<br>Class Name: BIO260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Knowledgeable, funny, cool, helpful.  Quizzes were open notes, but unless you knew the material the book did not help much.  Very enthusiastic and passionate about teaching. Great professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/03/2011<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He explained the material very well, and I wish he could have taught the whole course. He's very patient and thorough in his explanations.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2011<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cloning and Biotech. Whole class is discussion based. 2-3 hours of sitting around and going over the 2-3 articles assigned for the week was not hard at all. Quizzes are open notes and you can use your laptop. Lowest quiz score was dropped. Final is a breeze (another discussion). He stares at you for approximately 6 seconds after you answer a questi</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2011<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It is embarrassing to say that I almost gave him a standing ovation the first time I attended one of his lectures.  He explains the material extremely well with analogies galore!  He is patient and has a sense of humor.  Fun Fact:  He explained atoms by juggling in front of us.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2010<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He always explained the material very well and didn't use powerpoints, which made understanding the material much easier. He makes corny jokes, but it makes going to class not boring. I actually learned a lot from him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2010<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He always explained the material very well and didn't use powerpoints, which made understanding the material much easier.

Everything was open notes. The guy is very helpful and very intelligent...he knows his stuff. I would recommend him with this class, not sure about genetics, heard it's hard with him so I would stick with Silliker</div></div></div></body></html>
