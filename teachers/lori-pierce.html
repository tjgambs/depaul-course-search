She goes from topic to topic, and has a way of belittling students when their opinion or answer is not what she wanted. Her grading is tough and almost impossible to get feedback from. The subject matter is so interesting, not the worst class ever.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2014<br>Class Name: CULTURE<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Condescending, rants frequently about pop culture instead of sticking to course material. Very knowledgeable in history but highly apt to criticize those with a lack of knowledge in the topic. Unless absolutely required, refrain from taking her. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't Take This Class. She goes on random rants during class and you almost never finish talking about a topic before moving on to the next topic. Best of luck if you take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All these comments are spot on.  She goes so off topic with these abstract, redundant rants.  LSP-200 prepare for a draining semester.  I advise pottery 100 or maybe smashing some pottery over your head before this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2013<br>Class Name: AAS220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher. Had her for Buddhism and it was the WORST class ever. Pick another religion class. Only take this class if you can stand a teacher who tears your self-esteem to shreds. If not, this teacher is not the one for you. She will make you feel like an idiot whenever you speak because she is so rude. RUN THE OTHER WAY.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2012<br>Class Name: HON301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very rude and demeaning professor.  I do no appreciate the way she talks to students or runs her classroom.  My advice is to avoid her at all costs.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rude and insulting.  She is also very unfair wit her grading scale. Just the worst.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2011<br>Class Name: AMS220<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is very difficult. She gives a lot of reading and essays to write almost weekly. Also, she wants you to write in a very specific way and if you don't you might get a lower grade. I managed to get a A- but it was not without a lot of stress and a few nights of staying up until 6am writing papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2011<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>worst prof i've ever had at depaul. if you don't write the exact way she wants, she will rip you apart. and you don't know what she wants until it's too late. she's horrible, she ran like 3 discussions and if you have a discussion group don't bother reading the other groups because participation is worthless.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible! At first I thought she was very nice, but I was very wrong. Her grading scale is nowhere near being fair. If she actually dies email you back, she is very rude. She was so rude that it hurt my feelings and I felt put down. I don?t understand how a school like DePaul would give her a job. I hope she is better with her next class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2009<br>Class Name: AMS224<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doesn't respond to emails. Her classes consist of her talking non-stop</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2009<br>Class Name: AMST300<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the worst professor that I have had at DePaul.  It's not because she's a difficult grader or that she is particular about writing style, but because she is incredibly opinionated and creates personal vendettas against students who openly disagree with her &quot;factual&quot; opinions in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2009<br>Class Name: HON111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't do it. No, I'm serious, don't do it to yourself. Listen, I'm not exactly a slacker, but I have never been more stressed out then by this course. I cried -- tears and all -- to THREE librarians and went to FIVE different libraries in TWO days. And when I wrote to her in a panic, she basically told me I wasn't trying hard enough.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2009<br>Class Name: HON110<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sucks that my 'intro' class to college was HORRIBLE. Seriously, she thought we were stupid, way too much writing, and zero feedback, just insults. She would always say look in your style guide, buy a style guide, blah blah. Stop trying to make up for your inability to teach by shoving a style guide down my throat. Not one person could stand her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2009<br>Class Name: HON110<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is one of the worst professors ever.  Super hard and there is no pleasing her, ever.  She is always right and if she asks a question and you answer it, you are still wrong.  DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE THE MOST STRESSED OUT PERSON IN THE WORLD.  Oh, and race is an illusion.  Tell her that.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2008<br>Class Name: HON110<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's not awful, and she can be a lot of fun during field trips and even in class... cool person to talk to. But not a very good writer, hate to say - and extremely critical despite this. Hard to understand what she wants, contradicts self often... pretty silly &quot;rules&quot; and all. Not a class for english/writing majors... you will be FRUSTRATED!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2008<br>Class Name: AMS261<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DEFINITELY a B. She was horrible. I usually love writing and topics about ethnicity and race, but she killed it. She has very aggressive &quot;teaching&quot; style, and her comments on returned classwork and homework (including the final paper with the impossible grading standards) were not constructive so much as insulting. TAKE HER IF YOU'RE INSANE.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked her class.  She was an interesting teacher, and very intelligent.  She did care a lot about writing, but it's important.  She's a hard grader, but I feel like I learned a lot in the class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2007<br>Class Name: AMS261<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is not the worst but not even close to the best. She is very unclear with her guidelines and gets MAD when you ask her to explain, as if the students are idiots or something. But, without touchign the textbook, I still got a B in the class. Not too bad if you have no other choice</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2007<br>Class Name: AMS265<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For a boring class i think she makes it fun and i HATE american studies.

EVEN THE OTHER PROFESSOR TALKED BAD ABOUT HER. HER WAY IS THE ONLY WAY, NOT UNDERSTANDING AT ALL, DO NOT GO TO HAWAII WITH HER CAUSE SHE WILL RUIN EVERYTHING FOR YOU. YOU COULD BUST UR A** IN RESEARCH BUT SHE WILL NOT CARE CAUSE IF IT DOES NOT INTEREST HER IF IT'S A DIFFERENT OPINION FROM HER, THAN ITS WRONG.

She took a while to get the final grades posted but other than that she wasnt too bad, swore quite often which was surprising at first.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Too much work, too much ego, too many essays, too little help, too little reason, too much Lori.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2005<br>Class Name: AMS<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is HORRIBLE all she did was talk about herself and trust me she's not that interesting.
