I don't really even think she taught much; it was mostly life experiences she talked about. Try to think about that older friend your mom has that doesn't get the hint that you don't want to talk, and that is this woman. She's nice though, and will give you good feedback.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/13/2014<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is somewhat difficult to understand when she talks. She makes the class much tougher and explains it much longer than it actually is.  She is a nice person, but not the best teacher. No need to buy a textbook for this class though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Leeb is a sweet woman. However, she does not, teach you how to write. Whatsoever. "Lectures" were life talks. She was very unclear in her expectations & grading. She did not once clarify to me on what grade a paper received, & would not inform me when I asked. I had no idea what my grade would be until the end of the quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the worst professors I have ever had. She is the hardest person to get in contact with. She will never answer emails. She is so unclear with what she wants. Her class is basically a joke, yet she will give you horrible grades for no reason.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take her. It is nearly impossible to get an a. What you get on the midterm is what you'll end up with in the end. She's a nice person but a bad teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2013<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is SO nice, but never replies to emails. Her lectures were dull, dry and TORTURE to sit thru. I mean, she would ramble and end up off topic. She's your basic English teacher:great at writing, proof reading, and she's read every book imaginable.She's just not teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2012<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would definitely not recommend taking her section of WRD 103. Her lectures never relate to the class and she does not teach you how to write. AT ALL. Overall she is very sweet but class is painful to sit through.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/02/2012<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Leeb for business/professional writing- which is required for my major. I don't really recommend Leeb but she isn't that bad. What she teaches in three hours could definitely be taught in about forty five minutes. She is a very particular grader but you get to resubmit two of the assignments at the end after you correct them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2012<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Has good intentions, but I never understood how the discussions related to what we were writing about.  Deadlines were confusing, and never really set in stone.  Very hard to pay attention.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree that she is a nice teacher, but the class was extremely boring. Half of the kids never showed up and the other half were on their mac laptops! She never shows up on time to her own office hours, and we NEVER used the textbook. DISCLAIMER: SHE DOES NOT TEACH YOU HOW TO WRITE.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a relatively nice person, but her classes are useless and they rarely have any relevance to class topics. I felt that I wasn't learning anything during lectures, and I felt that being in the class was a complete waste of time. Avoid if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2011<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is convoluted in her lectures and clearly biased.Out of all the WRD professors DePaul has to offer she is easily one of the most unqualified.

Covered stuff that you would prob encounter in the business world. If you do everything, and get help on the revisions you'll prob get at least an a-.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2010<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She speaks weird but it only takes the first class session to get used to it. The class is fairly easy. The class is pretty boring though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She lets you meet with her outside of class often. BUT, her comments are not useless. She tell you you need to do this and that to get an A, however, you'll never get an A. Stay away.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DON'T DO IT!!! STAY AWAY!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I tried to be fair coming into the course, but she wasted the opportunity I gave her. She is quite easily the most useless professor I have ever had. I learned absolutely nothing, her lectures were a waste of time, she shows up to class late often, and is very vague about 99% of her requirements.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Once you get past the voice, she can be interesting. Likes to talk. She's available and tries to be very helpful. You always have to ask for specifics. We only did three papers and a research paper. As long as you revise, you can get a B+ or A- on a paper if it's not perfect. She does expect you to have learned from previous writing courses.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2009<br>Class Name: WRD504<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Seems to be a fairly nice teacher, although I have my reservations about how helpful or instructive she will be. Her voice can be really distracting, and she does not seem to be that good of a lecturer.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2008<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>so nice but terrible teacher.  she likes to rant on able being maketable to companies for 2 classes and doesnt take the time o actually show you anything. sits in a chair and reads examples. not a good way to learn.  class structor i bad but i would recamend her b/c she is easy.  you will be on your own for this class though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2008<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the nicest lady ever, the class wasn't hard but you will have to work for your grade. She grades very fairly and if you are afraid of grammer, she is the one to take because you can revise as many times as needed. I learned so much from her- take her if you are worried at all about this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2008<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You really have to ask her questions about the paper(s) you are writing about. Don't expect her to spoon feed you everything. If you see her during office hours she will help w/ questions. Overall she is a really nice and personable professor, and is eager to help you if you try. Revise your papers and you should atleast get an A or B in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was one of the most boring lectures ever. It was a struggle not to skip class. I can't be too hard on her because outside class she's the sweetest person ever.  Its impossible to do poorly unless you skip the 2 in class ssignments or don't revise your papers.  Don't buy any of the books, you won't need them. She's too nice to trash, but a bore</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2007<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horribly boring. Unless you want to sit and do nothing for an hour and a half, do not take her. She is awful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly, I think I would recommend her. Once you get over her extremely annoying, crying voice, she's pretty easy. Go meet her for conferences and she'll tell you exactly what you need to get an A. I got an A no problem and she actually did point out things to me to make my writting better</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2007<br>Class Name: ENGL202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Annoying crying voice, unclear what she wants, impossible to get a A, boring life stories that has nothing to do with class(she goes one for 1 hr on one story), need coffee, and still I havent learn anything yet besides the formats. She grade harshly and doesnt teach u to write professionally either. She thinks big of herself. Bad teaching</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>hhhhhhhh</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2006<br>Class Name: ENG202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you're a guy good luck trying to get an A.  I made all the corrections she asked for my papers and ended up with a B.  Other friends had the same problem.  She's not clear, but the class isn't hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2005<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's pretty unfriendly and goes off on the most boring stories, and weakly tries to relate them to the class.  You have no idea what she's really looking for, her grading is highly unclear.  She made what should have been a fun class into boredom and tedious teachings.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2005<br>Class Name: ENG202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mrs. Leeb is a nice woman, however she is a mediocre instructor. Besides formatting certain documents, and a couple tips on writing… I did not learn much in her class. Her class, however, is not too challenging. Just take her class and get it over with since it is a requirement.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2005<br>Class Name: ENG202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Oh my gosh! this class is boring...boring!

She goes on and on and she is boooooring. She means well but speaks really slow and repeats things over and over and over and over and over. Get the point&#63; You'll earn your grade in her class by staying awake. Other than that it was a good class. It sucks, because this class is required!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2005<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OH,wow.
