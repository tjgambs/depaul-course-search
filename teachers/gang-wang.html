If you actually care about probability theory and statistics, you have nothing to worry about. Take him. He just wants to see dedication, hard work, and interest. You'll have to go to every lecture, read each chapter of the book, and even do the even problems, but afterwards, you'll be a probability wizard. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2015<br>Class Name: CALC2<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is extremely intelligent however I do not think his personality is suited for teaching.

So what if his accent is some times challenging to understand, he still makes sense of every piece of information that's given. MathLab is his teaching mechanism. Very helpful and thorough; makes sure every student individually understands every topic. TAKE HIM!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2014<br>Class Name: MAT304<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Wang! A legend of the DePaul math faculty. I won't lie, Dr. Wang is really tough, but he's an awesome guy who will push you to work and succeed. Wangs also offers a good amount of extra credit so you can get your grade up and his lectures are super funny. He is tough, but worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2014<br>Class Name: MAT351<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really hard class, but Professor Wang provides many opportunities to improve and offers additional office hours. He does a decent job showing the application, but I always had to use additional online lectures to understand what was going on.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2013<br>Class Name: MAT151<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing guy.

The test were nothing like the hmwk and he only took points away from my work shown.  When I tried to do my own method that worked for me, he wouldn't count it and gave me 0 credit.  DO NOT TAKE HIM.  Got a D+.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2013<br>Class Name: MAT152<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The problem is the way that he teaches the class. He gives you a few examples of a problem in class, and then your homework on My Math Lab consists of 90% problems you didn't learn in class. His tests are also randomly generated from MML, so you might not have even learned it. Hard grader, but sadly, a kind of nice guy. Don't recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2013<br>Class Name: MAT152<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He teaches a concept in class and then when you get to the online homework (MyMathLab), you have to learn everything else that he didn't teach. You will spend about 3 or 4 hours on each of the two homework assignments due each week. He does give some extra credit but not enough to make this a class worth taking. Avoid this professor if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: MAT261<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE TEACHER! teaches one type of problem in class which forces you to teach yourself through MML. you will spend over 10 hours a week on 2 HWs and 2 quizzes online due over the WEEKEND.  he also DOES NOT give partial credit which is ridiculous in math. and he uses MML to make tests, so extremely hard and problems that you have only seen once.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2013<br>Class Name: MAT151<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Clear explanation, but too much work. I dropped the class mid quarter with an 88 because I was doing 10+ hours of MML work a week (not exaggerating, exact numbers from MML). I love calc, had an A last quarter, but this class had so many problems! 2 hw and 2 online quizzes per week usually amount to 60 problems that take 10 mins each. Don't bother!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2013<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He uses MyMathLab so much, it felt practically like an online class. During class, Dr.Wang did not touch on many of the types of problems in the homework, which means you have to teach yourself using MyMathLab. He is just so good at math that he seems to forget that he needs to boil down the topics and make them easy to understand.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2012<br>Class Name: MAT260<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The professor was horrible.  I have taken many math courses and this is by far the worst professor I have ever had.  Still managed to do well in the class from teaching myself using mymathlab but the professor did not teach the class anything.  He did not believe in partial credit and the tests were extremely difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2012<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely terrible professor.  If you try to talk to him, he will just tell you it's your fault for not understanding.  Relies on others to teach you the information and doesn't cover anything once it's been said.  Forget about asking for a review over anything.  His tests are brutal and are focused around things he doesn't even teach.  AVOID HIM.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2012<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE PROF! His accent is hard to understand, he is stubborn, doesn't always answer questions asked in class, and he just plain doesn't teach well. Don't take this class if you are not highly proficient in algebra.   He is by far the worst prof I have ever had.  Only plus is that his accent and antics can make him pretty hilarious at times.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/30/2012<br>Class Name: MAT152<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great math professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2012<br>Class Name: MAT152<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class material is very hard. You have to study every week, but if you attend class and really work hard you can do well. He is a good teacher but you have to know your algebra and attend class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2012<br>Class Name: MAT152<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a fairly good professor.

Sometimes he goes a little fast and doesn't slow down but overall if you study you'll do well in his class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2011<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best math teacher I ever had. He moves at the optimum speed. From beginning to the end of class you listen and take notes. If you do this well you won't have to learn from the book. He prepares you well for the exams. If you study what you know what you need to know you will get an A. Take this teacher if you want to learn math.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2011<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As long as you do the MyMathLab quizzes, hw, tests... you're golden.

They can only be due to incompetent or unprepared students who received bad grades. His notes are great and I didn't need the text book. Practice quizzes are exactly like the real quizzes. His summer calculus classes require knowing your precalc and trig because they are accelerated.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2011<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this with Gang Wang in the Spring and learned NOTHING!  This class was a complete waste of time.  I had to teach myself everything and got little to no help from Gang Wang.  He makes you feel stupid for asking questions.  I took this again with Prof. Butterworth in the summer, got a B, and now understand the material.  Avoid Gang Wang!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2011<br>Class Name: CALCA<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Wang is a great professor. He does stress that you must know algebra! He cares about his students. One day i missed class and he emailed me and asked if everything was ok and to check with him to let him know in the future. I think people are intimidated by him in. Hey, you gotta know algebra period</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2011<br>Class Name: MAT152<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Im a math education major and I still struggle through this class. He knows the material inside and out, hence the phd. Though he expects that we also know it at his level which is asking an awful lot. I pay a lot of money to learn this, and yet have to look to online videos and discussions to teach myself. Stay away!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2010<br>Class Name: MAT152<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is so hard!  Im a math major and i struggled with this class. He gives a quiz every week and lets he redo it for 1/4 credit.  Homework every week, a midterm, and a final. The weekly quizzes, midterm, and final are made up  of problems chosen randomly by his computer. If you like when professors rush through material Gang Wang is right for you! :</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/06/2010<br>Class Name: MATH150<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DONT BOTHER. impossible to do well, let alone pass. comes off as a good guy (in the beginning), but could care less if his students do well or not.

It is hard to learn during his class and most of the time i did have to teach myself outside of the class. He is very smart though and he does want his students to do well.

If you are disciplined and good at calc you should be fine!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2007<br>Class Name: MAT161<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Wang is a math wiz. I took  3-courses of his (two calculus and one prob/stats) back in 2002-03. He expected students to do their homework & if you didn't, he knew. If you showed strong effort, he respected you much more. His exams were based off the homework AND prep-problems that he had. If you did all of these you were golden.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2007<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher!  I am an accounting major, so I didn't really need the class.  I took him for MAT 150 and 151.  Although the class is a little difficult, IT'S CALCULUS!

Bad grades lead to bitterness, obviously. Gang Wang really understands his material very well, and if you are having trouble, he will always help you during office hours, or through e-mail.

I promise you, you won't regret it. Gang Wang likes to make his quizes and tests so much harder than the homework that  no one does well.

I was taking his stats class, and I had a serious medical problem that didn't allow me to complete all of the required material, and he would not even give me an incomplete.

In the first class he goes over some materials that everybody should knwo and he suggests dropping the class if what he covered is too tough for you and he's right.

Without huge extra credit I would get an C in his class. He's funny at times, but that doesn't matter much when your grade is endangered.

I failed a math class for the first time in my life with this teacher.  I am taking the grad. level Mat451 and am passing with an A !!!!  Do not take this teacher if you want to pass.
