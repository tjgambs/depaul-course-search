There's nothing on D2L, but he responds quickly to emails. He is a tough but fair grader on papers. The problem is that there are only two papers and one test (the final) in the class, and it is VERY hard. You must study up on every case and write detailed briefs or you'll have a tough time on the test. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2014<br>Class Name: PSC366<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the worst professors I've taken. Incredibly hard grader. Only one exam but it's 40% of your grade, and grading method is unfair and outdated (0 points unanswered question, +2 for correct answer but -1 for incorrect).  Pointless lectures, wasn't good at generating discussion. Do yourself a favor and avoid him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/06/2011<br>Class Name: PSC260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just had him for 1st amendment.

HIS CONTROL OVER STUDENTS WHEN THEY TALKED TO MUCH= AWESOME. VERY FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL! TESTING= NOT SO FUN OR EASY BUT FAIR. IT BASICALLY COMES DOWN TO DOMINATING THE MATERIAL AND STUDYING HARD BECAUSE THERE ARE NO GIVE AWAYS OR PITY POINTS. PURLY BUSINESS!! TAKE HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2010<br>Class Name: PSC364<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Barnum is a terrific professor -- not an easy professor.  Those who are looking for an easy A would be wise to look elsewhere.  The amount of reading is easy by 300-level standards, but he expects you will know it forwards and backwards for your final and in your papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2009<br>Class Name: PSC261<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The lectures are interesting and he tells you everything that you need to know for the tests, but that means you have to go to class and take good notes. Overall, the class is really interesting with class discussions and he is always willing to help you. I would definitely recommend this class and professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/15/2009<br>Class Name: PSC255<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredibly boring. He doesn't require textbooks which is nice. Class is pretty easy. One paper. Midterm and final aren't horrible, but the grading is most certainly not to our advantage. He takes off for wrong answers, making it possible to get a negative score.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2008<br>Class Name: PSC260<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Barnum would be a good professor if he had any fairness. His lectures have nothing to do with the ridiculous midterm/final. Plus, a final paper with absolutely no guidelines other than a topic. Tons of studying and effort for a final/midterm encompassing a text book he wrote and 200 some pages of supreme court case briefs. Not worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/29/2008<br>Class Name: PSC260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i hate to say it...but the class is boring. he could make so much more of the subject. maybe its time 8.30 timing too. tests are pretty hard but also curved. you learn a bunch but i am not especially impressed with the lecture.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2008<br>Class Name: PSC262<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>chilll teacher.. not big on participation but ull do it anyway cuz the material is interesting. his tests r kinda tough. he liked to cancel class on friday a lot - would say, &quot;If you guys answer this question then no class on friday!&quot; otherwise really interesting class, but u still gotta put in some work. he went to Stanford too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2007<br>Class Name: PSC262<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His tests and papers are difficult, and you do have to do all the reading. The material is really interesting and class discussions are fun, so I think it was well worth it. If you are serious about politics he is a great teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/03/2007<br>Class Name: PSC260<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What I loved about the class was the discussions of court cases, I learned a lot more about the Constitution than I had known before. I absolutely hated the exams. I feel that he doesn't prepare you well for them. You need to know almost every aspect and detail of cases to get an A, its imperative that you have a darn good memory! Unfortunately I didn't =(</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2007<br>Class Name: PSC262<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good prof. True the exams are tough T/F w/essays but his very liberal curve makes up for it. Funny and engaging. Even if not pre-law still useful info on how to keep cops from violating your rights. Tough elective class but a necessity for pre-law students. I'll take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2007<br>Class Name: PSC262<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Barnum is a great Professor;and he knows his material.I learned more in his class about law in just 1 quarter.  I plan to take him more often.  I just feel that I can understand when he teaches how the court system works, I learned in just 1 quarter.  He sparks an interest for me to pursue future law courses. Fun teacher nice person.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2007<br>Class Name: PSC364<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible professor. He is incredibly difficult. The average score on his final is a zero. How&#63; Because if you get a question right, you get one point. If you get a question wrong, its minus two.  Also, if you want help with papers, he will not see them earlier. So basically, you are Screwed.  He does not have notes and is terribly unorganized. RUN!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2006<br>Class Name: PSC261<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher!! Very liberal but not imposing. Very knowledgable. Goes over cases very thoroughly in class. Don't ever have to speak in class if you don't want. Yes, he has a different testing style (+2 for right, -2 for wrong, 0 for no answer), so if you don't know, just don't answer the question. Classes are nice and straightforward.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2006<br>Class Name: PSC262<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow, i put soo much work and received a C.  i felt as if i got robbed. get this clear, for the midterm & final, if you get an answer right - you get 2 points, but if you get an answer wrong- u get MINUS 2 pts. in reality i got a 42/50, but since i got 8 wrong, that was minus 16 pts. SO DONT TAKE HIM,</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: PSC262<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome! This teacher was one of the best I have had. He will make you work for your grade but if you do the work and keep up, you'll make it out fine. Although I want to stress he is hard and lots of memorization is needed. However, I would gladly take him again because I feel Ive learned more in one quarter class than in one full year. Awesome!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2006<br>Class Name: PSC262<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you plan on going to law school, take Prof. Barnum. Yes he is difficult, but you will learn the cases backwards and forewards if you apply yourself and participate. Although he is tough, he's a good guy so he won't try to screw you over.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/04/2005<br>Class Name: 262CASESTUDY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was such a great teacher.

Is the only prof that still takes points off for a wrong answer in T or F. Expects us to know the cases quite intimately, but only discuses them briefly in class.

His lectures are stimulating and interesting, he makes the class laugh while still teaching intense material. Every political science student should take a course with him. He is difficult, but do the work and you will be fine. He is A+!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2004<br>Class Name: PSC261<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Exams & papers are challenging, but if you go to class & study, you can get an A. Very willing to help students outside of class-1 hour before the final, a group of us went to his office for clarification on something & he told us which parts of the study guide were not on the exam.
