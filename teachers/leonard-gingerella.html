Professor Gingerella makes it interesting and provokes thought.  There's some work involved, but it's actually a fun challenge and doesn't feel like classwork.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2008<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just took this class for December intercession. Great class. Book is not 'mandatory' like he says it is. The only thing we used it for were 2 cases (that you can easily copy from the book). Grade consisted of a huge group project, 2 cases, and a final exam. Really easy. He encourages a laptop so everyone is facebooking the entire time, anyways.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2008<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Profesor Very helpful cares about his students doing good not only in school but in there professional life..

He's a great teacher n VERY EASY! attendance not required. Basically you learn how to do a business plan n at the end of the quarter u turn 1 in that u do in ur groups. there was a midterm/final combination test, n it was so easy. just go over the slides n u'll be fine. I had him 4 a night class n we always got out super early :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2007<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>THis was the first class he taught at DePaul which the class did not know who was the teacher till bc it was TBA on the schedule. It turned out that now I am graduating, he was the best teacher I have ever had at DePaul. Now he teaches graduate students since after he taught an undergrad class, but he deserves it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2007<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No 40 page paper is due.  If you show up for class and do the assignments you will do fine.  We never had to stay the whole 3 hours - usually done by 8:00.  Great guy from a great city.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2006<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had this prof. for winter intercession, during a week long course, m-f 9am-5pm.  we had a group project to do, and we had half of each class session to meet in groups and work on it.  Very fair grader.  Expect to present in class more than once.  Great sense of humor, great experiences in enreprenuership.  We didn't have a 40pg paper.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2006<br>Class Name: MGT370<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a great teacher with lots of experience. All you have to do is work on the business plan. He looks at details and will help you through out the classes. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2006<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He lets you make up work if you miss it..thats about the only good thing about this class.  A ridiculous 40 page paper due at the end of class.  Good idea but too much detail.  He seems kind of condesending to students who he thinks are &quot;airheads&quot; and picks favorites.  Cases due each week, Take home midterm, and final 40 page paper</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2006<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is a 40 page paper due by the end of class and it's single spaced.  Do not take him, other classes are way easier.  Who has that kind of time for 40 pages&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2006<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy.  Very understanding.  He has a lot of experience in the field and has great stories.  I would reccommend him any day.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2005<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is interesting and very experienced. Bonus - he lets you make up work if you ever miss. Final project was long and tedious, but he is pretty understanding in grading. Lectures went the entire time, sometimes with no break so nights may seem REALLY long. Stick it out and it's usually worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He flies every week from Austin, Tx just to teach two classes. best class I have ever been in since I came, Jan 2005. Very enthusiastic, knowledgeble, not boring one bit, well experienced in the field, class seriously participates alot-very fun. downside is, you have to spend every min in class.</div></div></div></body></html>
