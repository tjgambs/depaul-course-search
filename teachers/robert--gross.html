He is using visual aids a lot, he is very clear about what to expect from quizzes(4)+Take Home Project(1), exams(2). He gives tons of extra credit. He goes over the material before quizzing you on it or giving you test. You have to really try hard to fail this.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2015<br>Class Name: RISKMGT<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's really nice and is clear in lectures but the lectures didn't exactly prepare me for the midterm & final. I felt a bit confused still. The final project was a lot of work and very stressing. I ended up getting full points but it was very difficult for me. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2015<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is hard to begin with.
