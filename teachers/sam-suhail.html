He excellent teaching style made every class interesting. He is undoubtedly an expert in his field. I would research some disease process and ask him questions and he knew everything. He is young but he knows his information to the top. I recommend him for any class especially medicine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/21/2011<br>Class Name: BIO115<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I TOOK HIS BIOLOGY CLASS BECAUSE I HEARD A LOT ABOUT HIS SUPERIOR TEACHING ON CAMPUS.

He's a waste of tuition money; you could get all the information from a book.  He cancelled almost half our classes on top of generating the final exam from generic &quot;battery&quot; sets.  Utterly disrespectful to paying students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2010<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sam is an okay professor. He cancels class a lot which is ok but when he doesnt, he is a good teacher! his tests and finals are easy and to the point</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2010<br>Class Name: BIO201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If we even had class, he would show up late. The lectures were very boring and contained no new info that the book didn't give us already. However, he was very willing to help me before the final. The labs were definitely the best component of the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2009<br>Class Name: ANATO1551<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Forget about trying to reach this professor by email or by phone. He will not respond!Even if you leave a call back number or a short message via email he will not respond.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2009<br>Class Name: CHE310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree with the previous comments. He was absent alot and without any advance notice. He is willing to help out if needed. His absences affects everything though</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2009<br>Class Name: CHE310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He cancelled about half the classes. Literally. And on days before exams, he gave you the entire test question by question. Once again, literally. &quot;Question 1 is about blood pressure. Question 2 is about the parts of the respiratory system.&quot; I'm not making this up. Easy A&#63; Yup. Will you learn anything&#63; Nope. Waste of time and money.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/29/2009<br>Class Name: BIOL201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>EXCELLENT TEACHER.....TESTS WERE FAIR AS LONG AS YOU FOLLOW THE NOTES.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2009<br>Class Name: BIO201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Like some people said, lectures were a joke. 8:30 am to find out he's not there; and don't bother looking for an email, cuz you probably didn't and won't get one. Lectures, when they did happen, were straight from the book. Labs were good thanks to TAs. VERY unhelpful with emails; he either ignores them or replies curtly and uselessly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2009<br>Class Name: BIO224<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>one of the more difficult bio classes i've taken. to succeed: either go to class every day and keep up with your notes/the book the entire time OR miss class but MEMORIZE the book before the test. he asks very detailed questions and you REALLY need to study to pull off an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2009<br>Class Name: BIO224<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Warning this class is not a joke. He does grade the tests on a curve which helps.  For our 1st test the class average was a D. I bought the book after the 1st test and it did help me understand more for the 2nd test. Class is boring you don't really learn much, just study REALLY hard for the tests and you'll manage. You will fail if you don't study</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2009<br>Class Name: BIO224<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT TEACHER. VERY VERY SMART AND MADE THE CLASS VERY FASCINATING. NOT TOO MANY GUYS IMPRESS ME AND HE DID, PLUS HE GOT LOOKS.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2009<br>Class Name: BIO224<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>3 tests, 1 dinky hw that counts as a proj which is supereasy. His tests require an all out study day w/ a friend, but tells you evrytng thats going 2 b on it #by# material is semi-tough not him, reads off ppt (posted on bb) & ads 2 it bring laptop 2 class annotate ur notes u CAN attend either of his sessions Tu/Th o MWF despite what u signed up 4</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2008<br>Class Name: BIO310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kept me interested in the class. Test were fair and had lab info on them, i liked the pictures he had on the tests. multiple choice and matching mostly. Hes a physician so he talks about some really cool clinical experiences at times. Great professor and very nice to talk to.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2008<br>Class Name: BIO310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class and great teacher. He looks young but he knows his information very well. The powerpoints are way better than overheads for this class. His tests are very fair if you come to class, take notes and read the powerpoints. im taking him for anatomy too</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2008<br>Class Name: BIO310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A great professor and his medical background adds a lot to the course. The class is no doubt advanced and I consider it difficult, but if you study the notes and come to class, you can ace it. I highly recommend</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: BIO310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was a joke the teacher was late or never there (dont even bother coming). Lab lasted a half hour sometimes less. Tests and powerpiont straight from the publisher. Tests were inconsistent and included multiple repeats of question on the same exam. Basically a self-taught class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2008<br>Class Name: BIO310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice, but do not like his teaching methods. Straight from power point and he is always late to class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2008<br>Class Name: BIO310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He put very little effort into teaching this class and it shows. Read straight from powerpoints provided by the publisher. Labs were a joke and lasted only about 45 minutes. He was late to most of the classes when he actually did show up. His tests ranged from easy to excrutiatingly detailed. This class was such a disappointment.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2008<br>Class Name: BIO310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If he  showed up to class, (he cancelled 3 lectures) he read straight from a power point provided by the textbook.  No need to show up to class..He never does.  He was helpful though, and gave the class the exact material to study for the exams-which we all needed because the lectures that he did have were so incredibly boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2008<br>Class Name: BIOPH202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really cool professor. He is a medical doctor as well, so he's always bringing interesting information into lecture. He's funny and just a really chill dude. Tests are fair. His reviews basically tell everything that's going to be on the exam. There's no way anyone can fail this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2008<br>Class Name: BIO310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Suhail is very intelligent and elaborates on the subject with ease. Being a doctor he sometimes talks about medicines and treatments but overall the lectures are OK. Huge slide packets(100-120) but he literally cancels a lab day and tells you everything thats gonna be on the exam. Not super easy but manageable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2007<br>Class Name: BIO310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Suhail is extremely intelligent and helpful. In addition, his lectures were somewhat interesting as long as he wasn't rushing through the material, which occurred at the beginning and especially toward the end of the quarter. Labs were extremely easy and boring. His two midterms and final exams were solely composed of multiple choice questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2007<br>Class Name: BIO310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>In two words &quot;THE BEST&quot;.  Easy going and very smart. He is a young professor, yet very knowledgeable. He is a medical doctor, so he explains the material very well. I recommend him to anyone! His personality is great! Labs were fun, keeps students interested!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2007<br>Class Name: BIO310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very impressive and smart professor. Very clear on the material and he teaches with passion. Goes out of his way to help students during and after class. Exams are fair!!Very motivateing professor!!!</div></div></div></body></html>
