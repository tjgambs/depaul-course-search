Don't expect his class to be like others that you have taken, because the structure will be fundamentally different.

He does not care about his students. He canceled about 3 of our night classes and 1 of those we did not find out about until we arrived in the classroom. He doesn't respond to emails.

You have an in class response paper to something u read, and then a mid term which is basically u writing for 2 hrs straight.

He's inconsistent with his grading & allots/takes points arbitrarily and not based on actual merit.

Otunnu's taeaching evaluation in the department of history (they are in files at the reception) and confirmed that his evaluations are at the top.

His teaching expectations are shaped by his previous training and teaching in Canada and the UK. If you have been getting good grades for poor quality work, don't take him.

Otunnu. However, those who qualify to join any majot university should take him. His expectations are quite high and he lectures with that in mind. Excellent professor who is willing to help student reach their full potential.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2009<br>Class Name: HIST241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took the same course with some of the people who wrote quite harshly about the professor. Those of us who participated in class, followed the instruction he gave, and worked hard, got very good grades. The professor was quite clear in what he expected us to accomplish. he was very clear in his lectures. The grading was clear as well.

His assignments were beyond unclear, ambiguous, and very little guidance was given as to what we even needed to do to get a good grade in the class. Suppose it didn't really matter -- his grading on things like participation (which was worth 15% of the final grade) were done arbitrarily. Nice guy, but I'd never take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2009<br>Class Name: HIS241<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am a senior with a 4.0 who enjoys history.  WORST PROF. EVER.  SOOOO unclear in what he wants in EVERY assignment.  Only lectured in 3 of 10 night classes, other classes were exams that were never clearly explained.

He is unavailable, and inconsistent and also lectures for less than 2 hours of a 3 hour night class.  He cancelled one class because it was inauguration night.  Not worth the money, aggravation or time if you ask me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2009<br>Class Name: HST132<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS MAN..it's clear he couldn't care less about how his students do, he is very unclear and short about what he expects out of you, on top of that the subject he gave my final paper on wasn't even covered in class and barely in the assigned reading, and i have to write a ten pg paper and do a 20 min presentation on it...AVIOD!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2008<br>Class Name: HST241<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know what these people are talking about.  This man was possibly the worst professor I've ever had... he's a nice man, he's just never in the country enough to teach a class, and doesn't care.
