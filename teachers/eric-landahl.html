It's a lab based class where you observe the material you're learning, then analyze your data to solve problems. Even without lecturing you learn so much, you just have to be willing to put in the effort. Lots of extra credit and exams aren't bad at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/19/2013<br>Class Name: PHY171<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As was stated, he does not teach. We asked him to do so and his first "lecture" was an assessment of our class and had NOTHING to do with the physics we were studying. The workload is huge and you have to teach yourself. He should NOT be paid to teach since he does not do it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2013<br>Class Name: PHY171<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gen physics is already messed up at DePaul (you don't get taught), but he took it to the next level! He never lectured (he did twice actually but about easy math stuff). It also seemed like he was never willing to help. That is, when he was even around (he studies at Argon lab). Arrogant, disrespectful, unclear, & unprepared. Absolutely awful</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2011<br>Class Name: PHY270<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor. Knows his stuff and is very helpful when asked questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/05/2009<br>Class Name: PHY171<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor. Sure he's new at teaching but for being so new I couldn't ask for more. He was extremely prepared to teach the material. And sure the homework was hard, but he always made sure we were prepared for tests.</div></div></div></body></html>
