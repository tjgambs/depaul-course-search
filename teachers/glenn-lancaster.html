He keeps talking all the lecture and it turns super long, and if you're not REALLY into the topic you may fall asleep in class. The lecture was tough but if you keep with your texbook, make a lot of annotations and ask him any questions you might have, it helps a lot.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2014<br>Class Name: CSC402<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It was an easy class, he mostly goes through java and helps you. I had to review the lectures couple of times for his later homeworks.   Overall he's a decent teacher and was willing to email me back about my questions. (Usually 1-2days)  Helping eachother is KEY. The forum he provides you... make sure your classmates abuse that. It helped alot</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2014<br>Class Name: CSC402<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice man, but absolutely horrible teacher.  Forgot to post quizzes and HW to online section's D2L.  Hasn't even opened any of my HW files almost halfway thru qtr.  Comes late to every class.  Teaches incomprehensibly and boring.  Will say he is about to go over quiz questions, or handout a HW, and then never does. Disorganized, doesn't seem to care</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2013<br>Class Name: CSC402<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Disappointed. No course grades were given to students until the week before the final. Homework was error ridden and responsiveness to questions was horrible. I would NOT reccomend this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2012<br>Class Name: CSC374<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good man, good classes - one of my favorite DePaul professors.  I took him for CSC 373 and 374 and would definitely recommend him to everyone.  Friendly and extremely helpful and knowledgeable - if you are struggling with the work or concepts just ask for help and he will demonstrate anything/everything with seemingly endless patience.  Five stars.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/08/2012<br>Class Name: CSC383<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Lancaster is a great professor. He will stop everything to help you until you understand the concepts. Students always come first. He is OK with HW assignments being late as long as he knows you are trying. He really knows his stuff. I took him for two different classes because he is that good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2012<br>Class Name: CSC224<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I went into this class knowing no Java, but a lot of python. Thats my fault. Still the organization in this class is not existent, and i cannot hear his lectures. His monotone voice just lulls you to sleep. He cannot keep a single thought for very long, and his lessons reflect this. Overall I did not do well in this class. recommend different prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2012<br>Class Name: CSC373<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Lancaster is a good man. I never spoke to him during office hours, but from what I heard he is very helpful. His lectures were organized and very easy to follow (exceptions exist) I would suggest taking this class with this teacher. You will be surprised about how much you learn. Thank you Lancaster for being the best CS teacher so far.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/28/2010<br>Class Name: CSC343<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is not only one of the most knowledgeable and brilliant professors at DePaul, but he is also a phenomenal, funny, patient, friendly and considerate of his students?He will assist you more than any other person ?included your parents- till you get what the material is? I salute you, Dr. Glenn.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/13/2010<br>Class Name: CSC224<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, just attend class, pay attention, and ask questions if you need to and he will help you get a good grade. He does tend to speak very softly, so sit in the front of the room. he was one of the friendliest professors I've had at DePaul. He is really helpful one-on-one and very knowledgeable about his material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2010<br>Class Name: CSC373<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teachers there is at DePaul.

Way better than my last C++ professor at least!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2009<br>Class Name: CSC373<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy. Obviously knows his stuff. But... Completely disorganized. Publishes the syllabus, but doesn't follow it. Doesn't return grades. Changes due dates at last minute. Can be very frustrating to deal with. The homework is challenging, but he's a very easy grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2009<br>Class Name: CSC373<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best Teacher ever. If you have to take CSC 373 and you don't take it with him, shame on you. Bet Teacher ever. I got 106% overall in the class and i wasn't even sure how i would pass the first assignment and/or midterm. Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2009<br>Class Name: CSC373<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a helpful teacher, and is a good teacher.

Every other word that comes out of his mouth is &quot;Uh&quot; or &quot;Um&quot;...He is incomprehensible and because of this he is very ineffective at teaching and I would recommend waiting for a different professor instead of taking a class with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy was one of the friendliest professors I've had at DePaul.

I was surprised how disorganized he was.  Also, he was 7-11 minues late for each class.  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.  If he was teaching a class I needed, I would actually wait to see if someone different was teaching it next quarter.  I got a very good grade, but learned almost nothing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2006<br>Class Name: CSC261<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A good teacher but he seemed to be pushing a bit too much on some advanced topics, especially since this is a beginners class. For a few assignments, we had to use some advanced functions that he wrote which was confusing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: CSC261CSC262<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easier grader, very helpful, and laid back.
