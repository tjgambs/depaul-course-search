She created an environment that made us feel like a family rather than classmates. Her passion and knowledge of the material was clear in each lesson, and I would definitely recommend taking any of her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2012<br>Class Name: MOL201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great person.

Pick her brain and listen to her life story. You'll be fine in the class if you let her get to know you and show serious effort at connecting the material to your experience.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2009<br>Class Name: MOL342<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nesreen is an amazing professor and a wonderful person as well. She is extremely intelligent, and could definitely be at a better university than DePaul, so we are lucky to have her! Her class is fun and something that I always looked forward to, which is why I'm taking another class with her in the fall.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2009<br>Class Name: MOL342<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nesreen was one of the most fun teachers I've had. She is super easy but also extremely smart and passionate about the topic. I learned so much about Arabs and their culture, media, and literature! Great for first timers</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2008<br>Class Name: ARAB2000<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>nesreen is cool and makes the class a confortable environment in which everyone can share experiences and want to participate more...all learning environments should b like this...shes funny and nice..come to arab culture club and see..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2008<br>Class Name: MOL340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fantastic professor.  She's brilliant, and should be at a better school than DePaul.  However, she takes pride in building up programs and luckily DePaul is her project.  Take her, learn easily.  She builds her own course material, no stupid textbooks. She's great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/14/2008<br>Class Name: ARB101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Nesreen for ARB 101 102 and 103. I would love to be in her class again. She sets a fun mood for her class. Everyone knows everyone and we all chill and learn Arabic. She is extremely knowledgeable about the language and culture I LOVE HER.She is AWESOME the most SWEET professor you will meet at DePaul. Makes learning arabic fun & easy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2007<br>Class Name: ARB100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SUPER EXTRA ORDINARY!!!!!

You wont really learn too much unless you do a lot of stuff on your own outside of class.  She's better than the other Arabic teacher here at depaul.  so  if you want to learn arabic take her i  guess.  Depaul's arabicprogram sucks though!!!</div></div></div></body></html>
