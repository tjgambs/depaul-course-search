It's nice for an intro to doing monologues and getting up in front of people but we didnt really work on charachter development as much as i would have liked. super easy class though</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2007<br>Class Name: THEAT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very fun class!!! i absolutely loved her class. i love acting for film more than theater and she doesnt force theater acting at you. VERY VERY FUN! 100% reccomend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2006<br>Class Name: PERFORMANCE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was awesome! I highly recommend her. The class was so easy and so much fun, I was actually sad when it was over. My favorite professor at DePaul</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: PRF290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This woman is so cool. You come into her class and get to play games, be funny, and just sort of hang out. Yuo do have minor homework sometimes but can do it five min. before class. Midterm is a monologue, final is a scene. I'd hang out with her outside class. Take the workshop!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2005<br>Class Name: NCMTG<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sharon is a dangerous woman who teaches as she performs, with commitment and mystery.  Take any class she offers.  She is the Grand Dame of Chicago theatre.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: PRF290<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes awesome. A little rough on the edges at first but sh can be a lot of fun as well. Only a 2min monologue as a midterm and a 2-3 page analysis as a final. very easy class, great arts and literature requirment. EASY A. you wont want to miss a class. TAKE IT</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2005<br>Class Name: PRF290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing class. Cool teacher (she has dreads) who is really into the physical aspect of theatre so alot of the classes were yoga style classes. A little unconfortable for the guys I think but fun all the same!</div></div></div></body></html>
