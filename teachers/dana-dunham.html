I really enjoyed her class. She does make you read your stuff out loud to either the whole class or a small group, which can be intimidating and difficult at first. However, I think that was a good thing for me, because I was always shy and now I feel a lot more confident about my writing and what I have to share with the class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is awesome and so nice!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice women, young and still a kinda new teacher.
