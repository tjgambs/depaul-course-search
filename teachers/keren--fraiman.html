I am a third year poli sci student who has had a fair share of poli sci class and nothing compares to this one: 150 pages of reading a night. Luckily, no term papers, just two short reflective papers on the reading. She is nice and clear She'll show clips. She's a very tough grader. Exams are short answer and essay. </div></div></div></body></html>
