Why I came to DePaul's entrepreneurship program. Learn enterprise concepts taught around the world from the DePaul professor who created them and apply them in a team consulting project. He opens his network to students and is always available. No wonder he won both teaching awards at graduation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2015<br>Class Name: MGT595<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Rather not say</div><div id="right"><div>Very good class with a lot of learning to be gained. You will be be a part of a team to help grow a social venture that requires help. It will require a lot of work and motivation but I can guarantee you this "It will be worth it". Prof. Patrick will help your team along the way if you need him. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2014<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Like everyone's said Prof. Murphy is very knowledgeable and truly cares about his students. He's a great teacher for the business capstone- you really put everything you've learned to good use. Recommend being a team lead for the project (lots of work but guaranteed an A plus excellent experience). Wish he taught more classes. Awesome prof overall!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2014<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Murphy is one of the most inspirational and motivating professors I have ever had.

I've had two classes with him at DePaul and both have been my favorite classes in my time here. If you want to be inspired, actually learn, and enjoy a hilarious class in the process well then you need to take a class with him. Murphy is THE MAN!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2014<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>The grade consists of a midterm and a project. The midterm- he didn't grade and decided to give everyone an A. The project- as long as you do it, put some effort into it, and don't anger your team lead (since the team lead grades you), then you'll pass with an A. Just show up and look interested.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2013<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was without a doubt the best class I have taken at depaul.

While it is challenging you will be glad you did. Most of the class is providing help to the entrepreneurs. Don't buy the book! If you are outgoing and well organized be a team lead. They have to do a bit more work but it will be rewarding. Take him you won't regret it. Only one test and its easy and a Final presentation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2013<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is by far the coolest professor at DePaul.

I can write an essay illustrating how good this class is but I can sum it up with BRILLIANT. I was a Group Manager and it wasn't an easy job at all, but it was definitely a pleasant experience that i will carry on to talk a bout for years..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2011<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Murphy was such a pleasure. You can tell he loved teaching, and I learned so much from him. His class is challenging and forces you to learn, but he's really helpful. He's also very encouraging to his students.

He is an amazing teacher, I was scared the first day because the course seemed really demanding, but I am SO GLAD that I stuck it out. The midterm is hard so study!

TAKE HIM you're life will be better for it!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2010<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Murphy is a credit to his profession.  Many professors at DePaul are mediocre at best.  Murphy is a great teacher.  He is professional, well dressed, upbeat, and well traveled.  Class time flies, and he actually teaches.  The group project was intense, but fun.  Watch out for his exams. Questions are tricky with more than one right answer.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2009<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is by far one of the best teachers at DePaul. I think every teacher who has a bad rating on here, should go and learn something from Mr. Murphy. Do not think that this is a blow off class, because it isn't. You learn in many different ways. He is very accessible and wants his students to succeed!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2009<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Simply amazing. Murphy is one-of-a-kind teacher who loves to be around people and has one of the greatest minds at DePaul.  Do yourself a favor and attend his class.  The actual work for this class is time consuming and requires literally a daily commitment, but Murphy is there to help you every step of the way.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2009<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this class. For sure sign up to be a manager it will give you lots of experience that you can't find in another class.

He really wants everyone to work together and learn as a group, not just as individuals.  The class is easy if you pay attention.  You're graded on attendance, midterm, final, and project.  Each are worth 25%.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2008<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very entertaining professor. Funny and class time flies by fast with this one. It can be a lot of work, but its worth it because you might use it in the future. Midterm and Final isn't too hard , you just need to think &quot;into&quot; the venture and seperate parts and explain it. Smart professor too!-Wish there was more of him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a great professor. Made the class very fun and exciting. You learn a lot in this class about managerial concepts and how to think.

The lectures are interesting and fun but the project is the part where you learn the most. The mid-term was a complete shock for almost everyone because the concepts were never presented in the same manner as they were presented on the test. Overall, an okay class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2008<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr Murphy is an asset to DePaul B-School. He knows his stuff and is a great person for advice if you have any questions about the class or jobs, etc. His class is more work than others but the amount you learn makes it worth it.

His lectures are entertaining, clear and with pure substance that is relevant to the subject matter. It's no wonder the Entrepreneurship program is ranked high when you have a prof. who is as engaging as he is. Challenging but not overhauling. Recommend to all!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2007<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent night class, he made management fascinating and is extremely talented.

Yeah I get it, hes cute, quirky... whatever, but all he cares about his getting it into the Tribune and that other people think he is &quot;innovative.&quot; I see right through him and I think he is a phony. I learned NOTHING about MGT in this class just learned how to waste my time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2007<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree with the comment below.

He takes things very seriously, and makes the class very entertaing. You have to READ the book. Lectures are okay. Two exams, and one big project. His exams are hard, but if you read you will pull off a B or A.

The midterm was very hard but the final was really easy. The main part of the class is the group project which is a pain if you have slackers in your group. Although if you talk to the professor and make it known that you are putting a lot into the project he will look highly upon it and grade you easier.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2007<br>Class Name: MPS500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors I've ever had.
