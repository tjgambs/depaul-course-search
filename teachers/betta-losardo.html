This class is a very difficult online class.  You will have to work hard to get a good grade.  There is very little feedback from classwork and sometimes it is very late in coming but if you work hard you can get a good grade.  Prof is very quick to respond to email questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2011<br>Class Name: IN307<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This instructor offers no feedback on any assignments including the final paper.  No textbooks are used, instead articles are chosen that are relative to the class of which many are interesting.  This class is held online, and feedback from the instructor was mostly one-liners.  I would not recommend taking classes from this instructor as a result.</div></div></div></body></html>
