I liked the way he shares his real life examples and breaks down the class material.  I can sit in his class and just listen to him and get the text material.  He explains things very clearly.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/15/2014<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good class.  Prof papabathini is a good resource.  He explains well.  One of the best professors at DePaul.  He always met with my group to answer questions and gave us good feedback.

Show up to every class and pay attention for a C.  Read the book and never show up to class and you'll get an A.  The exams are everything.  The real work is the project, but it's only 10% of your grade.  I wish I put in half the effort on the project and just focused on the exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2014<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I really enjoyed this class.  Professor Papabathini has lot of real world experience.  He has lot of experience working in consulting field and starting businesses.

It is professors like Papabathini I enjoy taking classes at DePaul.  He talks about real cases in business and compares class material with real life experience.  It is demanding but challenge you to think.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2014<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class because I am thinking about starting my own business.

Lot of Vocab words.  The prof covers everything thats in the book in his presentations.  He has lot of real world experience.  He answers questions that are not only in the book but also real world business questions.  You do have to read the book to do well on the exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2013<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do yourself a favor and avoid this guy. He is very inconsistent and does a terrible job of providing clarity in terms of due dates, expectations, etc. He just upload a bunch of stuff on D2L all of which has different information and different due dates. No consistency. He also has no idea how to answer students questions, he just says "look to d2l"</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2013<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>100% Power point! very boring! lots of definitions. Attendance is mandatory hundreds of definitions, that will come on both midterms and finals! But on the positive side the prof gives many chances to bring your grade up. study guide has 300 questions but only 75 will be on the test! Shame could have been a fun class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2013<br>Class Name: MANAGEMENT300<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Most boring class i have ever taken.

He makes all his slides from the book chapters, posts them on d2l, and every class reads directly from the slides. I thought he'd give us info on how his experiences relate to the course but everything isbook orientated. Not to mention he talks so softly I can't hear from the 3rd row...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2012<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked the class.

The entire class worked with 1 client.  He made me think about starting my own business.  I wish he shared more of his own experiences instead of the speakers.  He started several business and worked International.  Has lot of experience.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2010<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just took this class.  Great Prof.  Very helpful.  His lectures are clear.  He tried to sell Entrepreneurship as a career option.

Relates most lectures to the real world. This was a consulting class with real clients. Can be unclear in expectations. Changes the schedule often. Tough on the students. Will call you out and put you on the spot if you aren't paying attention. Straightforward/blunt but a learning experience.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/28/2010<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I like the class.

Prof. Papabathini is very knowledgable about entrepreneurship.  He has worked for fortune 50 company and started several of his own ventures.  He has lot of partical experience unlike many professors.  He is well traveled and has international business experience.  His exams are straight from the class lectures.

Groups are assigned with a real life business client.  The quizes are based on class lectures.   Class is good if you like business start-ups. Prof is good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2010<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is a joke. 1) he has no idea what he wants from the class which makes it impecible for students to know what he expects. 2 He is SO DISORGANIZED that he doesn't even know what is due and when! 3 he wants the projects and papers done a certain way, yet doesn't offer any guidance. Avoid him at all costs, and DePaul FIRE HIM!!! NOW!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2010<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Edward needs to take a step back and reevaluate the quality of work he is doing. I understand he's a busy individual but he needs to learn how to be a more effective communicator outside of class. Also, he needs to provide far more guidance in class during the group project like providing more templates. (After all, that is what Accenture does) ;)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2010<br>Class Name: MGTICS3<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The prof teaches how to start/run businesses.  He brings in entrepreneurs to the class and we work with real businesses.  It's a good class cause he teaches us real world stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2010<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class project is everything, yet this guy is vague at best about what he expects. Teaches us nothing, yet expects the highest quality deliverables. We've all done MKT/FIN/MGT projects in those classes--this class has you do them again; you will learn nothing. I would avoid this class and this &quot;professor&quot; at all costs.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2010<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can't fathom who would give this guy a good rating. He is the most arrogant, yet dumb, professor I've had. His teaching style comprises videos of other professors. He has somebody &quot;check&quot; his e-mail maybe once a month. Never available outside of class. Class project teaches nothing and requires a ridiculous amount of work. I want this guy fired.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2009<br>Class Name: ENT394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>lot of group work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2009<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is fluff and a waste of time.

No quizzes.  Merely graded on final deliverable.  Need to work with a team to get this done, so hopefully you are in a good group.  This class is different than others, bec you actually work with real entrepreneurs.  Easy A if you put a little effort into your final deliverable!  Lectures pointless bec no tests!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2006<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tough class.

I actually learned stuff that I can use in the real world.  Worked with clients who are real business owners.  The Prof was very knowledgeable about consulting and has lot of experience.

Have to do lot of outside class work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2006<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE! Class name is misleading..this is not an entrepreneurship class, it's a consulting class!
