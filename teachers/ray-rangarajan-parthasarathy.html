Made class interesting. Lots of hw but graded leniently. Lots of extra credit work. Exams tough but adds many bonus points so final grades were ok. Would take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/24/2015<br>Class Name: IT403<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Took IT403 Statistics and Data Analysis. This prof made statistics simple and easy to understand. Weekly home work had many problems to practice. One final exam. I found this class to be useful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2015<br>Class Name: IS421<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: C-</div><div id="right"><div>This is just ridiculous. I can't believe prof. is repeatedly doing this. A good leader is one who can learn and improve hisherself from the criticism rather than defending himherself and criticizing hisher critics. I don't think this is professional at all and I hope that it stops. My only advise: Improve your self rather than being defensive. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2015<br>Class Name: IS421<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>His an old school teacher, will make you read & hand write lots of works. 8to10 pages long handwritten "extraCredit".  Expect standard long question and multiple choice for midterm. TakeHome final, will take at list 12-15 hours to finish it. (Yes, Both are handWritten) I will never take him again. DPU should review his Credentials. good luck</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2015<br>Class Name: IS421<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: C-</div><div id="right"><div>Subject is easy but Prof makes you work so hard which isn't needed. Students should have options to use PC (we in technology field). It took me so much time to hand write final which was unnecessary. If someone's going to copy, they not going to learn. It's not Professor's problem. Let student make decision and allow modern technology usage. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2015<br>Class Name: IS421<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Yes he pushed hard and assigned lot of work but that work helped me to learn the material better. Midterm is in class exam. Final exam is take home open book. Gives lots of extra credit. Easy grader. In group project all student got full points. Easy AB if you study. If you want to get grade by doing no work that's your problem</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2015<br>Class Name: IS421<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>excellent lectures. real world examples. made class very interesting. no handwritten work when I took in fall but what's the problem with hand writing if you are a student that wants to study? students that are here to study had no problems with this prof. it is those who wanted to get grade without study that hated him. would take again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2015<br>Class Name: IS421<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher. I did not mind handwriting certain assignments because it helped me to learn and remember the subject. Professor explained this is to deter copying and help students to remember. In other classes I found two persons did the work and others copied the file. Sincere students get an A or B. Those who copy will of course complain.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2015<br>Class Name: IS421<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B-</div><div id="right"><div>Just avoid this class if you can. you will end up doing so much pointless work like writing 10 pages by hand and draw tables and diagrams by hand, when you can do all that easily by using tools like MS Word and Visio. One of the hardest prof. ever. So much unnecessary work, especially if you are talking other class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2015<br>Class Name: IS421<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I wouldn't take class with this prof again. Group project has 15 people in team assigned by him. We can't use PC and have to hand write notes, extra credit, and take home final. Grading were given unfairly. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2015<br>Class Name: IS421<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Has great knowledge about the subject but he always find away to make things difficult to the students .</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2015<br>Class Name: IS421<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Makes things difficult unnecessarily.

Pushes students to work hard but eventually gives good grades to everyone in the class. Lectures are very interesting since he uses humor. I would take his class again anytime.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2015<br>Class Name: IS421<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting lectures with lots of humor and industry examples. Lots of extra credit. Exams were ok for students that actually studied. If you put in reasonable effort and study, easy A or B. He is very helpful and kind if you meet him in his office and ask for assistance with subject matter. Respected by all students that come to study. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2015<br>Class Name: IS421<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Initially plays tough -midterms tough but towards end loosens up. Most class got A or B final grades. No one failed. Guess he wants to scare the students into working hard. Knows subject matter well. Encourages participation a lot. Adds humor to make class interesting. Provides numerous real world applications which makes lectures very useful. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2015<br>Class Name: IS421<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class itself is interesting, but the way its taught is not well organized and very well explained. I wish I could have taken this class with someone else. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2015<br>Class Name: IS421<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: C</div><div id="right"><div>worst professor ever.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2014<br>Class Name: IS421<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Lots of extra credit. Tests are tough, but easy grader. Makes you work for your grade, but eventually tries to give a good grade to everyone. When I took this course from talking to my friends it seems 95% of class got A or B, only a couple students said they got C.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2014<br>Class Name: IS421<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you read his class notes and text you can do well.
