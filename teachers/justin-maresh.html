He's passionate about the material and presents information in a manner that gets you excited about it too.  He expects students to work hard and develop a mastery of the material.  His lectures are upbeat and entertaining.  I miss having a class with Dr. Maresh.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2011<br>Class Name: HON221<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is such a nice guy and genuinely wants his students to learn. He's also super thorough when answering questions. and he is hot. so so hot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2010<br>Class Name: CHE342<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Biochem's a difficult subject but Justin makes every effort to make things understandable, especially with the notecards. Problem sets every week, kind of annoying when you have an exam that week. Not all biochem prof's concentrate on organic so much, he does a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2009<br>Class Name: CHE342<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Biochem sucks, Justin is awsome. He never fails to make me giggle. He is really helpful outside of class, although he is lightyears ahead of us normal people, and he talks a lot about things I only slightly comprehend. He's a total nerd, but if you are taking Biochem so are you, so you'll love him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: CHE104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class material was definitely a little bit challenging- but just the material before the midterm. He is incredibly helpful, friendly, open to all questions, and has a genuine interest in teaching students. He knows his material! Plus, he's cute. I recommend.</div></div></div></body></html>
