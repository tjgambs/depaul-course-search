No homework, no participation points, no attendance. He gives you the exact problems that will be on his tests, all he does is change the numbers. You are allowed to use your notes for tests. He makes the material more difficult than it actully is, found myself teaching myself the material at home. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2014<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>class is misleading. pro open book, open notes, he gives you the problem to be tested ahead. cons he grades hard, teaches the whole class period and has odd way of approach to mathematics. you will not learn anything. But he is the best choice because the others are hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2013<br>Class Name: MAT135AND136<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is extremely easy but I don't know how much I actually learned. It is a SUPER easy A. Class attendance is not mandatory. His teaching methods are old but as long as you take notes you will be okay. Exams are open note and open book so there is not reason to get anything less than 100%. HW is given but not collected.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2013<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's an okay guy, the way he teaches is old school. All the exams including the midterm and final are open notes and open book. Easy A if you pay attention to what he writes on the board.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2012<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Hardy for MAT 135 and MAT 136. No prior knowledge of Calculus. If you pay attention, take good notes, and do the homework, real  talk, sit pretty close to the fron [his handwriting is small and scribbly] no reason not to get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2011<br>Class Name: MATH135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You pretty much don't need to pay attention to what he says in class because everything can be learned more clearly by reading the book. His lectures are confusing. He lets you use your notes, your book and any in class problems on the tests. He also only gives four tests through out the quarter including the midterm and final, so take good notes!</div></div></div></body></html>
