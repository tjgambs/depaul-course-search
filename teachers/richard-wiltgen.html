I'm now a senior, Economics major with a 3.8 GPA. I got a B in this class but worked super hard. These other comments are accurate. Tests are convoluted MC based solely on his lecture, a method of teaching that should not be used for Econ. If you like the subject and care about grades, do not take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2011<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All that counts for his class are the midterm and final. His exams had nothing to do with the the readings in the book, they were supposedly based off his notes but you cant understand any of his notes b/c he mumbles.Attendance is mandatory, and he wants everyone to be on time but he is always late.DO NOT waste your time or money taking this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2011<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wiltgen lectured from a stack of notes in his textbook but rarely looked at them. Besides not providing any help on sample problems for the exams, the grade for the class was based soley on  midterm & final. Both contained 80-90 questions with essays. Not only were they long, the questions consisted of 5 confusing choices each. I studied for 30+ hours the week of the final and midterm. Ended up with a C- in the class. Worst college class taken to date. At least I passed</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2011<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor I have ever had.

Lectures might be boring if you're not an Econ major, but if you come to class every day and take notes, you should be fine. The class consists of a mid-term and a final. He also curves.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2010<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have never been in a class that I hated more. He has no powerpoints or anything to make it easier to learn, he just sits in front of you and lectures. Its only a mid-term and a final, but the 80 multiple choice questions on the tests are nothing like what he says in class. Hes strict on attendence but yet he's always late. DON'T TAKE HIS CLASS.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2010<br>Class Name: ECO330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just be ready to do alot of work. One of the hardest but one of the best classes I have ever taken. Take alot of notes.Final and midterm come from class lectures so write everything down. However, he is no help outside of class. So if you need extra help don't bother asking him because he is usless</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2010<br>Class Name: ECO330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is tough. I have not received my  final grade yet, but wanted to rate this guy as honestly as possible. You need to attend every class, and take TONS of notes.Test are pretty much based off his notes.He speaks fast and mumbles, so it does not help that the test are based off his verbal notes.Honestly,try to take another class, if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2010<br>Class Name: ECO330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy knows his stuff, and is very serious about his class.   However, this particular class, ECO330 requires a high level of understanding the in subject matter, and a personally interest in the material.   Do not take it unless you are prepared to work hard.  The professor is great, although he sometimes talks fast, he's not bad</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>When it comes to economics this guy knows his****.  His class is exteremely hard if your not a good test taker because the midterm and final make  up 100% of your grade. I got a C- and still think his teaching method is the best for econ. If you have other econ classes to take, knock one out with this guy and the other will be a breeze.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He seems clear when he lectures. The problem is that his test don't match what he teaches - meaning he gets his multiple choice question from a book. There 80 on the midterm (40%). and the final is  60%. I never read the book even a little so maybe that was the problem. But I usually never read textbooks and always get As and Bs. Not for slackers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He takes attendance but usually he is 5 minutes late to class. Midterm counts for 40% while the final 60% of your grade (difficult test). The other comments are right about him using the word &quot;alright&quot; often and changing the volume of his voice. He is very knowledgeable of the material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2007<br>Class Name: ECO330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is by far the best econ teacher at Depaul.

The whole class is based on attendance, midterm, and final which are both hard, he doesn't give you a study guide, only based on whether your a good note taker. i came to every class, took notes like a secretary and i got a D, maybe i'm stupid but i passed my other classes</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2006<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher sucks.

If you are a teachers pet, he will be nice to you. He is not clear at all and his tests are extremely hard. He claims to grade on a curve, but he doesn't know the meaning of the word.

He talks like this the whole......time. Very Hard, his tests are almost impossible and this was my second time taking MACRO. Only 1 midterm and 1 final so there is no room for error.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2004<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Everyone compalined about him but I thought he was very good. Pay attention, read the book before he talks about each chapter in class, and take good notes. He challenges people to think which is why a lot of people don't like him, but he was good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2004<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the only class I struggle to pass!!!
