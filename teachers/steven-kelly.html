His assignments half the time were unclear as was the group project. I got an A but I would never take him again because I don't feel as I learned anything. One quiz, weekly homework, group project, and cumulative final. It helps if he knows your name and you attend class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2014<br>Class Name: MKT393<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The guy is full of himself. He was late to meetings. Based on his vague comments I don't even think he reads the paper. I asked him why I lost some points on my first draft, and he struggled to answer. I personally think he is biased, and I would never take another class with him. His opinion of you will effect your grade!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2013<br>Class Name: MKT393<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SUPER HELPFUL!!! He just doesn't care about students turning in papers but he also helps the students find their interest and guides them in the direction! ONE OF THE BEST PROFESSORS!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2013<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Kelly is a good guy. He enjoys teaching and is very fun and enthusiastic in class. He can come across as being a little unfriendly outside of class, but if you show him that you care about doing well and are a genuinely nice and personable individual he will like you. Overall it's a fun class that is enjoyable and relevant.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2012<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had A++ going into final exam,which I was really confident about but surprisingly received final grade of B+.Because he's absolutely biased.He likes u,u receive A+.He doesn't,GOOD LUCK!evn tho u might have well over 100% like I had.Absolutely rude when u go before/after class for any help.U don't believe me,ask ForFinalGradebreakdownAtEndOf Term.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2012<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Kelly has a ton of experience in the marketing world and really knows what he is talking about. I enjoyed this class. It consists of lectures, individual weekly assignments from the book (not difficult),  and a final exam. No midterm. Dr. Kelly is in charge of the marketing internship program, and he is willing to help find internships!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2012<br>Class Name: MKT393<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The guy is full of himself and a tough grader.  His opinion of you will affect your grade.  He is the only option for this class so you really have no choice.  If he would have liked me I would have got an A but he didn't oh well.  He really needs to check his ego!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/27/2011<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was fun and easy. Mostly based on discussing about marketing about companies. Slide shows are method of teaching. Fair grader. No book is required. Easy A or B. And you'll learn something.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2009<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pointless class, fairly easy if you do the work. If you participate he'll remember you. His powerpoints always led to tangents that had nothing to do with the material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2008<br>Class Name: MKT393<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Challenging course. The guy really helps you with your paper and other assignments. You really want to make a good impression with him because he has mad hook-ups with jobs in the future. Seems a little arrogant, but cared about me as a student.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2008<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher. Very enthuised about marketing. Alot of group work in the class so be prepared...! Be prepared to work for your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2008<br>Class Name: MKT393<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't think that he's such a hard grader. If you put in some decent effort, you'll be fine. I didn't like him, however. I thought he wasn't interested in my career plans or professional interests at all, and the career advice he gave me was quite perfunctory. I wouldn't take another class with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2007<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall good professor. If you pay attention to his lectures and read the book, you should be fine. He's also really helpful, so you can ask him any question and he'll try his best to help you</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/20/2006<br>Class Name: MKT393<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took internship with him and this guy is great.  We talked about my project and he was very helpful and interested in what I'm doing and about my career.  He helped me work out my networking plan and my project will help me find jobs.  I don't know what other students have found but he is great one on one.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2006<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take this professor. You can go to every single class...get an A on the midterm....get an A on every assignment (each over 3 pages single spaced)...then, turn in the take-home final (which should be impossible to not get an A on) and somehow not finish the course with an A. Do not take this professor. His grading is unfair.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2006<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2006<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Grading is hard but fair.  If you follow PP lectures he tests on that in the book.

Whole class is about Power Point and some Hand outs, not clear about Mid Term and Final. Nothing from Power Points comes in the tests.
