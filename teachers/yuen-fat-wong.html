He makes funny groans. He confused himself and spends most of class time trying to figure out problems for himself.  He gives you a great practice sheet for the tests.  Seriously not a bad class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2007<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Agree with comments below. You won't learn a thing!Knows his stuff, but doesn't know how to explain. Just come on days b4 quiz, he'll give you the quiz so if you know how to plug in #'s, you'll get an A. Will def. take the class since it's an easy A,you have to be a brain dead if you don't get an A or a B!If want to learn something, don't take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2007<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>YOU WILL NOT LEARN WITH THIS TEACHER. A CLOWN ON A BIKE COULD HAVE COME INTO CLASS AND HE WOULDNT NOTICE. HE GIVES LIL TO NO HW AND HIS TEST AND QUZIES ARE THE SAME AS THE PRACTICE SHEET.

He gives practice tests before test days, which are the same questions as the test with different numbers, and he explains quiz questions before handing out the quiz. And plus he doesn't really keep track of homework. Take his class, you'll enjoy it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2006<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2006<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2006<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this class was impossible.  after failing 4 times i finally gave up</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2006<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this is the hardest teacher in the world if u want an A dont take him. it was almost impossible to pass for me and i took it 3 times already</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2006<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>it's so easy to get an a in this class. the practice tests are exactly the same but numbers are changed. put the test in your book (or write it in your book) and cheat. a monkey could get an a. unless you are determined to learn, take this class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2005<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hate math, Wong is just right for you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2005<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT take this class. There isn't anything coherent coming out of his mouth. His lectures aren't understandable in any language and since he doesn't know what he is doing, there's no point in going to class.  Study off the book and the practice test. That's all you need to pass his exams. Learning in this class isn't an option.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2005<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow- this class was a test in communication.  Once I got used to he style of speech, the rest was a breeze.  Stats itself is a dull useless subject, this prof knows it and even jokes about it. The lack of a syllabus makes it necessary to go to class every day.  You never know if there is going to be homework or a test.

The practice tests are pretty much the same as the acutal tests, which are all open book.
