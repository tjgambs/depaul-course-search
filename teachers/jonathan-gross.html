I never got the impression that he was arrogant, condescending, or closed-minded - just the opposite actually. His instruction exemplified the much vaunted critical thinking that the university is supposed to teach. Thanks to him, I found a zeal for romantic poetry. Take his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2015<br>Class Name: ENG382<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of my favorite English professors I have taken at Depaul. His lectures are very enlightening. He seems to always draw from pop culture and current issues. He weaves this into his lectures and it makes them really fun and interesting. He is very nice and understanding. I recommend to participate a lot and as always read the text assigned! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2015<br>Class Name: ENG382<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He gives extremely insightful, intelligent and creative lectures. He provided handouts to encourage critical reading of the poems we read. The class was a hybrid, which allowed for more time to independently read. He was available for office hours. Prof. Gross is a must take as an English major because he actually teaches you to critically think. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2015<br>Class Name: ENG231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Dr. Grosss teaching style. I enjoyed the class discussions because the information was simply not fed to me but rather I was forced to critically think about the novels and overall understood them better. Dr. Gross provided modern comparisons to enhance my understanding of the material. I would definitely take again. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/21/2015<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man is so intelligent, but he has no organization. He knows his stuff, but his thoughts are often poorly communicated and go off into a thousand tangents. He asks that you read quite a bit, but it's not the worst content nor the hardest. I would say that he is a helpful teacher, but there's barely any assignments to ask for help on.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2014<br>Class Name: 231<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked him as a professor. He was frazzled at times and didn't have a clear class structure, but that was kind of fun. We did have to read a bit, but it wasn't too bad. He doesn't give clear grades or post anything on D2L. I didn't know where I stood in his class until after our final grades were turned in. But funny guy in his own way.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2014<br>Class Name: ENG442<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great professor and so humane. Great role model for students. He is also adorable looking and interesting to listen to. By far the most interesting professor in the English Department.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/21/2014<br>Class Name: HON100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Gross is extremely qualified to be an English professor.  He will help those that seek it.  However, most students like to have structure and organization; this class lacked predictability.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/13/2014<br>Class Name: ENG442<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>His graduate course in English Romanticism was challenging (in a good way) and a topic that could be interesting.  However, he lacks any "teaching" skills, is terribly condescending, arrogant, and takes disorganization to a new extreme.  While clearly a great scholar, he was neither a good teacher nor a particularly nice person.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2013<br>Class Name: ENG471<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow. I am amazed at how disorganized he is; he decided to change the syllabus mid-way through the course. He doesn't respect students' time or opinions, and his arrogance becomes really frustrating.  He doesn't listen at all to student reports and consistently interrupts them and makes condescending comments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2012<br>Class Name: ENG340<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Prof. Gross because, OH MY! You have to do some critical thinking on your own. I am extremely grateful for teachers like him who don't force-feed information into your brain but instead he gives you a piece of critical information and YOU get to expand on that idea. He's not a horrible teacher if you learn how his brain works.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2008<br>Class Name: ENG340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE. not helpful. disjointed and unclear lectures. not willing to TEACH. tremendous (almost impossible) amount of outside reading and/or knowledge necessary to succeed. arrogant, stubborn, closed-minded and whiny.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2007<br>Class Name: ENG349<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible professor! Does not reply to e-mails, doed not follow the syllabus, and does not respect students' contributions to class discussion. This class WILL lower your GPA.

You actually have to READ and DO the work.  It could mean doing research and re-reading/skimming the text over again.  VERY intelligent and knowledgeable.

We are in COLLEGE now, not junior high!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2006<br>Class Name: ENG340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Studying English I realize words are powerful device to communicate with.  Dr. Gross is a disgusting professor.  I have never had such a poor experience in a English class.  No structure, poor communication, does not follow the syllabus, or use the text accurately.  If you have no other choice and have to take his class, begin practicing meditation</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2006<br>Class Name: ENG245<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Gross is a very passionate, intelligent man. He really wants his students to succeed in his class and, if you approach him, he will be very helpful. Tough but fair grader. If you pay attention in class he will give you a good idea of what he wants in your papers. He's also very funny and insightful. Loves it when students participate.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2005<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ridiculously difficult.  Literally keeps me awake at night worrying about all of the impossible assignments.  Extremely intelligent, articulate, and passionate person, but Gross is someone I'd rather have as a friend/mentor, not as a teacher.  (Especially of a subject I'm not majoring in.) Plenty of other teachers to choose from.  Save yourself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2005<br>Class Name: WORLDLIT<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Expects students to know EVERYTHING and would get frustrated when we don't.

Syllabus was not followed and we were not given a grade on our midterms until the last day of class. He didn't even know some students' names on the last day either.

Don't take this class if you aren't going to actually read the material.

Hopefully, this is a good thing. Unbelievably creative and innovative approach to teaching. If you want to think on a different level this is the man to take.

Seems like a nice guy, but if he senses you don't care he will act like a jerk.  I think he's a fair grader, and he doesn't seem like he would fail anyone.
