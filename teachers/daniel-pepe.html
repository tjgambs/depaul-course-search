I highly recommend taking a class from him. He's funny and overall an inspiring guy.  He did get frustrated with the class once for a lack of reading, so have the readings done before class. It's easy. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2015<br>Class Name: 100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He looks like Seth Rogen. Only thing I can imagine half the time in class.  Grading wise I can see he only gives easy A's to kids who participate in class. Student's who don't speak much, I advise you to stay away.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2015<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Pepe is amazing, he scans the text posts it online for you so you won't have to buy books. Read, attend class, take detailed notes of what he says to add to the notes that he writes, & ask him for help if you need it. Also participate and give him feedback, he'll appreciate it. I actually gained an interest in philosophy because of him. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2015<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Pepe is a cool dude. This class was made easier by his efforts. There is a reading everyday, 1 page summary each week and 3 major assessments. He isn't the easiest grader but if you ever need help he is available. I would recommend the class, he keeps it interesting and tries to answer all questions one may have pertaining to the subject. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2015<br>Class Name: PHL101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the weekly 1 pg papers make me want to die</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/21/2015<br>Class Name: PHIL100201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Teacher - he is obviously very knowledgeable about philosophy.  He seems to answer anyone's difficult questions regarding philosophy without even missing a beat.  You can tell that he takes this very seriously and is super passionate about it.  I definitely recommend Daniel Pepe, but only if you're ready to learn, work, and be challenged. </div></div></div></body></html>
