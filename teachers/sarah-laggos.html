If anyone has ever worked in a serious environment or has an ounce of common sense, then this class will be easy.  Simple in class assignments, final memo, and class participation.  If that is what you pay thousands for, then you will be satisfied.  If you want more, find a challenging teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2011<br>Class Name: MTK376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A good looking Greek American so guys be gentlemen & behave.

She has left us because we didn't give her enough love. If you had a chance to take her congrats. If you missed the opportunity well sorry to hear that.

You most likely will not get an A. Especially since she will grade you based on what score your classmates evaluate you on. (she takes average of those 2 scores, and she won't accept good scores from peer evaluation so you have to purposely give bad grades even if person did amazing)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2009<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super easy and fun class. Midertm is to go to a networking event and get 5 business cards (no class that day), a couple small group presentations (on the spot and easy), 2 class presentations, and final is a memo, individual evaluation, and group evaluation. So easy. Had once a week. Let us out early and even cancelled 2 weeks of class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2009<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice, outgoing person. 2 class presentations and a couple small group presentations make up most of youre grade in which you'll get an A or B just for presenting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/21/2009<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's great...very outgoing, very interactive with the whole class.
