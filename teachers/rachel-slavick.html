She had no respect for the students in the class, and it became very evident that this was because we weren't theatre majors. The class itself was very easy, but she takes herself far too seriously, as well as the course material. You could not pay me to take this class again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2015<br>Class Name: PRF290<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Rachel is a great acting professor. I had a hard time warming up to her at the start, but once you start to understand how she works and critiques you'll be fast friends in no time. DO NOT take this as a blow off class. She is VERY serious about participation and attendance and she knows if you're slacking. I had to work for my A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2014<br>Class Name: PRF290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I absolutely loved her class! The activities we did were interesting and fun; she does a great job creating a comfortable environment for non-majors to perform in. Her class is very improv-oriented (unlike some other PRF 290 classes) but it inspired me to check out improv theaters around the city. Definitely take her class if you get the chance!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2014<br>Class Name: PER290<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hypocritical. Self centered. Her personality and communication skills ruin any part of class that would otherwise be fun and helpful. Some exercises seem to contradict each other.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2013<br>Class Name: PRF290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was my favorite class!! Slavick is the best drama/acting teacher I have ever had because she actually cares and you can tell. She breaks everything down so that you know exactly where you need to improve to improve overall. She makes it so fun and understands that her students are not actors and may be nervous to get up in front of people.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2010<br>Class Name: PER290<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kind of the Artsy-fartsy type. We never actually did scenes, we just walked around the classroom and were supposed to feel different.. Easy A, but most days are just so dull.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2006<br>Class Name: PRF290<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/13/2006<br>Class Name: PRF390<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2006<br>Class Name: ACTINGIMPROV<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great fun! she allows you to explore so much and is very open minded. her classes are great and you learn a bunch from her well rounded class. she's very clear with her directions and is very happy to clear anything up for you. i love her willingness to explore and accept and her coaching is great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2005<br>Class Name: PRF290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rocks</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2005<br>Class Name: PRF290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2004<br>Class Name: PERFORMANCE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2004<br>Class Name: PRF290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>go to ALL classes and you will get an A</div></div></div></body></html>
