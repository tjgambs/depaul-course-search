He may not be the most sociable and intimate person, but he is an amazing professor. He listens, responds, and allows you to express yourself freely. The class is not hard, but it's not a breeze either. I encourage other students to take the class. You won't be dissapointed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2012<br>Class Name: EE334<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is VERY boring. I like the experiments we do, but everything he says just makes everything else confusing. He also does this thing with his belt that is very weird. He's approachable though if you need clarification. He also grades really easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/13/2007<br>Class Name: EE334<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Kozoll is really sweet. He is not mean AT ALL! Actually he does crack a few jokes, you just have to joke back and he loosens up. You totally get used to the belt thing. Super sweet. Class is really easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2006<br>Class Name: TL415<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice guy! Very helpful if you ask for clarification. If you come to class, pay attention and put forth the effort, you can get an A. Great class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2006<br>Class Name: EE334<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2005<br>Class Name: EE334<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is okay. I hate science but he does make us do little experiments which helps.  Kinda hot but the belt thing is odd ... almost asked but thought it might be rude!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2005<br>Class Name: TL415<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a pretty good teacher. You do a lot of in-class science experiments that make the class go by quickly. The belt thing is really strange, but you can tell he likes teaching. He has a Ph.D. too... he's really young (young-looking at least)!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/12/2005<br>Class Name: METHODS<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a difficult teacher, does the belt thing.  Not a very GOOD teacher though, does not know how to get the point across...very open ended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2004<br>Class Name: EE334<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a really nice teacher. He is pretty easy and donesn't require too much work. He does this funny thing with his belt that you should watch for. Definately take him for Methods of Science</div></div></div></body></html>
