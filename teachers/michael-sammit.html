His classes are difficult to follow. He is an easy grader and will give you points for just about anything. If you need x-credit to boost your grade, just e-mail him and he will give you something to do.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2004<br>Class Name: PHI101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sammit is a really really laid back guy.  He has trouble explaining things.  His teaching has no substance, and that can get people angry.  His knowledge of the Simpsons is very funny though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2004<br>Class Name: PHIL<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
