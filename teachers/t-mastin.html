She's very helpful, I contacted her several times with questionsproblems, and she always responded quickly and politely.  She's a pretty fast grader for the fast December term.  There is a lot to do, but I never felt overwhelmed, and I was able to get ahead.  You will need the book!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2013<br>Class Name: PRAD334<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took the class online in 3 weeks and wow did this women give a ton a work. Every other day there would be 2 quizs due and a paper. Grading was semi-tuff not easy tho. Id shop around before taking her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/18/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD334<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A bit unclear in the beginning on assignments but she was very attentive and such a sweet person.  The book is used a lot so make sure to do the readings.  I would take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD291<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As Charles Barkley would say, she's "turrible." Crammed 10 weeks worth of work into 5.  Every class there was a reading response which counted for attendance... and taught you nothing.  There was a final exam AND a final project.  Had the option of taking her again fall quarter, opted to take an 8am with another professor instead.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD291<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her for a night class and it was a horrible experience.  She took over after the midterm and still tried to cram a full quarter's worth of material into 4 class meetings. Papers were due on the same day as exams, and there was a lot of reading. She also says she understands how much other work we have, and then gives you tons more.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD291<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was disorganized and very unclear as to what she wanted for the final (large part of your grade). Tests are short answer and difficult. Must study for this class. Has a habit of saying "in that regard" after every sentence. I don't reccomend this teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/07/2011<br>Class Name: PRAD334<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Mastin is probably one of the sweetest ladies I have met at DePaul. She genuinely cares about the students and will help whenever needed. The course is based out of the text, and her exams are based on cases from the text, but easy. Couple presentations too. Overall, nice lady with very relevant experience. Easy class i you read.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2010<br>Class Name: PRAD255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor. Taking her for the third time this quarter!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2010<br>Class Name: PRAD334<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very intimidating at first, and it can be hard to understand assignments and projects, but as the quarter progresses, it all becomes clearer. She is so sweet and really strives to make sure everyone is comfortable and understands the material. The class is really cool because it is essentially run by the students it tends to be laid back</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2009<br>Class Name: PRAD338<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Mastin is awesome. She is thorough w/ directions and very organized. If you don't understand, she is more than happy to help you figure things out. It is helpful that she takes the time to meet with students to make sure that they are understanding the assignments and projects in the class. She's SO nice! Do yourself a favor and take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2009<br>Class Name: PRAD382<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've taken her twice and I didn't even have any interest in the second class, I just enjoy her that much! She is such a sweet lady and really enjoys teaching! She makes an effort to  know everyone in the class. Very helpful if you need anything, in class or out!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2009<br>Class Name: PRAD255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took her, and at the beginning she seemed to be very harsh; however, she turned out to be the biggerst sweethear ever.  I just loved her classes.  Her tests are not that hard if you do readings and go to class. I am taking her class again and can't wait to work with her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2009<br>Class Name: PRAD255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a great prof. The class is really not that hard (quizzes are super easy as long as you go to class) and she makes the class as interesting as possible with the 'whats going on presentations'. Shes really understanding and there for students; the only way you'll do bad is if you just really don't try.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2008<br>Class Name: PRAD255<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are a frosh then take the class If your SR trying to take a blow off class, even though its easy there is so much busy work and must attend class. 5 exams 1 every other week. She doesnt really go over the material. she trys to learn names and listen pointless &quot;Whats going on&#63;&quot; projects in class. she post the slides but does not go over them.</div></div></div></body></html>
