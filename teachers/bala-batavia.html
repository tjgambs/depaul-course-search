As long as you do all of the homework and understand it, you'll do fine on the exams.  Midterm was pretty easy, final was much tougher.  Not much interaction during class, so it can be easy to lose focus.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2013<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The professor is a very nice guy and has a good attitude, but his teaching skills are subpar. The classes are almost pointless to show up to as he doesn't ever go over examples to formulas he shows. Basically have to teach yourself. Tests are nothing like what is shown in the book or hw. Tests=105 points each + 10 points for HW / 200 points total.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2013<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have an engineering degree and math is my jam.  However, this professor confused me on simple things like how to find the median, or take an average.

Do NOT take this class, I'm not sure if it was because of the professor or the material, but it's nearly impossible to pass unless it's your second time around taking it.

He teaches word for word from the book, and makes learnable information impossible. Class isn't mandatory, but he gives a huge bonus for showing up 100% of the time.
