Does assign lots of reading that is tough to understand. He goes over everything but is sometimes hard to follow. Only two papers which aren't horribly hard and he goes easy on you (like I said, doesn't believe in grades). Classes were a little dull but not difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2015<br>Class Name: PHL245<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>He's a really great teacher. Hard to follow at times, but he's got great insight into the reading. He hates grading which is great, but there are only 2 papers on which your entire grade is based. Classes were fun and chill, he's not a rigid professor. I would definitely take his class again, knowing what to expect now</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2015<br>Class Name: PHL245<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take this class if its your first philosophy class! There is a lot of reading (50+ pages per week). There are many hard concepts! Only two papers, no tests. Show up to class everyday bc he goes over all the readings more in depth. He's a nice guy, swears a lot and is willing to help during lectures. All texts are posted online.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2015<br>Class Name: PHL245<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far my favorite prof. Clearfair grader. Fun to be around. Open to talking tohanging out with students. He's wicked smart. If you have the chance, take a class with him. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2014<br>Class Name: PHL245<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Just take his class. You will enjoy it a lot. You learn an amazing amount of information, but he delivers it all in a very enjoyable, catchy, and interesting way. Tangents will happen, but their fun. You won't fall asleep. Small quizzes, an essay or two. Just read all of the material and you're good. He smokes, though, so it might smell a bit. lol </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2014<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A bit out there during is lectures, but keeps things interesting. He super straight forward about he wants. Outlined the entire midterm, which he referred to as a glorified quiz. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2014<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best and smartest guys you will ever meet!  TAKE HIS CLASSES!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2014<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Will is a great guy. Although his lectures are all over the place and often hard to follow, he will spend as much time as necessary with you outside of class to help you better understand the material. He doesn't believe in assigning grades so as long as you show him that you put in the time and effort in writing your papers you should get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2013<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I made an A. He is an easy grader. He's hard to describe...ingeniously eccentric, and quite possibly, mildly autistic. And yet, he makes low brow jokes, at which, the freshmen loved to giggle. WILLing to help. He made it interesting. Promptly answers emails. DO NOT procrastinate on papers! I would definitely take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2012<br>Class Name: PHL232<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The instructor was totally willing to work with me outside of class to further explore ideas relating to the material and was immensely helpful. He knew what he was talking about and what he was talking about and made complex ideas comprehensible and more important applicable. Endless respect for the dude.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/19/2012<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The instructor is able to articulate the material in a way that isn't just comprehensible but applicable to modern day life, which isn't common in the philosophy classes i've taken. His lectures are really entertaining and vivacious. one of the greatest instructors i have had at this school.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/19/2012<br>Class Name: PHL245<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I saw Will eat an entire walrus once. Coolest thing I ever saw. Also, the quizzes are easy as long as you do the reading and grading is fair. Would recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2012<br>Class Name: PHIL245<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This Professor is awesome. I loved him. He is very smart and kind and will give you some great things to take notes on. Write down what he says it makes it so much easier. Plus, he is kind. My friend recommended him and I really enjoyed the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2011<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>NOT A HORRIBLE INSTRUCTOR...HE DOES RAMBLE...I ENJOYED THE DISCUSSIONS...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2010<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great teacher he doesnt stop talking during his lectures...usually its interesting discussion.  The HW is mostly reading with a quiz at the start of each class you take a relatively easy quiz.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/03/2010<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I dont know what these people are talking about. The class was really good and intresting. Long lectures but its a philosophy class. He is extremely helpful and willing to help you get an A as long as you participate and ask for the help! TAKE HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2010<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lectures and is boring. Style of teaching is horrible. Makes us answer one questions for a 4-5 page final paper, but the question can be answered in less than a page. quizzes are easy, but you must read alot! stay awayyyy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/13/2010<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I wouldn't be surprised if he gave the first rating to himself. He made no sense, and assumed everyone was interested in his monologue. he rambled most of the class, TO HIMSELF. and smoked cigarettes and drank mountain dew before class at 9AM.</div></div></div></body></html>
