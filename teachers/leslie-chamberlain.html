She didn't answer emails or phone calls and cancelled class multiple times! Would not recommend. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2015<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>this is a pretty easy class. You show up and do ALL the works on time then you will get an A! There were two group presentations. Assignments are just watching online videos and sometimes do some works. Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/06/2014<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's the last person you'd want to be stuck on an island with but the first person you'd want to meet on a bus. nice lady, very clear with material and tons of energy. I rated her as very easy because nothing is challenging but you HAVE to do everything required of you. Go to class, do your work, and keep you A. No reason you can't get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2014<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Leslie is absolutely incredible. There are not many people on this earth that have the drive and enthusiasm that she carries. Her class is not 'easy' you do have to work, but if you WANT to get an A you absolutely will get an A. Work hard, come to class, pay attention, you'll do fine. She's a great person to know (she knows A LOT of people).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2014<br>Class Name: MKT398SSI<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Leslie is great. She really goes out of her way to help every student in the class. She truly has a passion for this class, and was helpful in every possible way. This isn't a 'blow off' class though. You have 10 weeks to make it work, if you put in work and effort you'll get a good grade. Loved having Leslie as a teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2013<br>Class Name: UIP240<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What she teaches she has loves so much she does not see the flaws in the content even when the rest of the world does.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: UIP240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, really cares about students and is always willing to help out.
