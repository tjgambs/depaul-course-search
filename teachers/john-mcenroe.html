Be ready to learn on your own. Make sure you do homework, he calls on students for credit. As for the exams, based straight off the homework, easy if you know what you're doing and study the homework. Definitely Recommend! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2013<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. McEnroe was not a very interactive and engaging professor. The class was pretty easy though if you are willing to put a little bit of effort in. Overall though you probably will not get much out of the course itself. I did a lot of studying outside of class, which was helpful but I would have liked to learn a little more in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2013<br>Class Name: ACC3045H<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a very average teacher. You either liked him or you didn't. He was very passionate about accounting. I was very confused in his class and basically memorized the homework answers for the test not knowing why the answers were what they were and got an alright grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2011<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm the same guy as the 304 review, so I'll keep it brief. There's a lot of stuff you have to memorize, but it's doable. Sometimes he can be confusing but if you need help go to his office, he's welcoming. I got my first A in acc off him so just study and you'll do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2010<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm not the smartest in the Strobels program but I worked hard to understand the homework and notes and wound up with a B. Mid/final is pretty much understanding the HW and notes. Unlike a certain other prof, McEnroe is pretty helpful. There's a curve. Take him if you can, be relieved if you have to.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2010<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>John McEnroe is amazing!

Participation is based on answering homework problems in class but he puts the homework answers online so there is no reason you'd get the answer wrong.

He's fair in his grading.. notes are probably not as clear as can be but as long as you do the homework, you'll be fine.. he's really understanding.. and overall, just a nice guy.

Knows a lot about accounting and the business world in general.  His lectures are not very clear and his notes are hard to follow because he's all over the place.  However, as long as you do the homework he assings class notes are not necessary because tests are just like homework.  Recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the best teachers.

Makes it really easy for his students to learn and understand the materials. Need an &quot;A&quot; then take him. As long as u know the homework u know the exams.

I agree with most of the comments, but here's the thing. McEnroe, at least for our class, goes too fast during his lectures. Important lessons aren't understood very well. The book is helpful and so is he if you ask questions. STUDY OFF OF THE HOMEWORK QUESTIONS!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2004<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>JUST DO THE HOMEWORK</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2004<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor!
