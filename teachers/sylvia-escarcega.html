A lot of the focus of the class is on native peoples and Latin-America.  If you're interested in these issues this would be a great class.  She's not a tough grader or anything, and she's a very nice woman.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/13/2011<br>Class Name: PAX220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At first she would just talk and was not too clear. If one does the required readings as well as the assignments, it will be easy to participate in class and get a good grade. She is a good professor, and really knows what she teaches on.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/13/2011<br>Class Name: PAX220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She really knew what she was talking about.

I turned in all my papers on time and it ended up that she lost 2 of them, which is why i ended up failing the class! She is mean and rude. Even though I worked extremely hard to pass, she failed me anyways even though it was her fault in losing my papers!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2008<br>Class Name: ANT345<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very hard grader, and gives the worst news with a big smile.

She is a great teacher and explains everything well. Her lectures are truthful. She is a nice person. She has a negative: not explaining assignment well. I did extremely well in her class because i worked really hard. I think this is the hardest class I have worked in.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take her class if you are not going to do the work.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Never gives back assignments/papers. Told us that feedback was for babies. Doesn't tell us what she wants and then gets really mad when we don't do it perfectly the first time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/03/2006<br>Class Name: ANT328<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher ever! ****y, waste of time, frustrating, BS assignments, not even a good person.

She is one of the kindest teachers I know, and is great to have discussions with outside of class, and she really cares about people.  She is passionate and intelligent.

For those of Us who could care less about indeginous struggles this class is like a dental appointment. Not only was the class boring the assignments were disportanlly hard for 200 leval course. I recomend her to no one</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/02/2005<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you do the homework, you are fine.  On the 1st day of class, she hands you an outline for the class and all the work you will ever have to do. She is a tough grader, but she gives opportunities for easy extra credit. Participate in class if you are not doing good on the assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2005<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know what else to say... this woman is an idiot. She doesn't have the credentials for teaching.  She is a hard grader and speaks and writes English that is grammatically incorrect.  Where does she get off being a hard grader&#63;  She's extremely boring and let us out LATE.  She rambles to fill the time when really we were done with the lesson.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Way too much work for an ISP course. Journals everyday, lots of reading. Do not take this class just o fulfill a requirement, it will require much more work than anticipated. Opt. for another ISP.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2005<br>Class Name: INT368<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't really know what to say.  I guess she is okay.  Not thrilling and had us turn in an assignment wk 3 and didn't get it back til wk 8.  I was really bored.

Very helpful, always willing to give advice and work with you.

Never explains what her expectations of you are before the due date of an assignment, rather once she returns it.  A lot of busy work, no tests, very unclear grading system.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/12/2004<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an excellent teacher. Just because she encourages us to think for ourselves and be creative does not make her unclear. I learned a lot and enjoyed her class. She obviously knows the material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2004<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Escarcega is as nice as they come, however she is a horrible teacher! She wants her students to do well and to take an interest in Anthropology.  She knows her stuff, but she is so unclear about EVERYTHING! Her expectations are unclear!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2004<br>Class Name: ANT<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have to admit she is very nice and always has a smile on her face, even when she is in a mad mood, but she is horrible. She can't teach! and because she can't teach, everything is unclear! You won't understand her grading!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2004<br>Class Name: LSTANT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a woman who is very knowledgable!

As said previously, she can't teach worth anything.

Doesn't give a lot of HW, but will load you down with a few big 'ole projects. Grades a little on the hard side too.
