He can get off topic a lot and his homework assignments aren't very clear, but his class was fun. You will have to do a lot of outside practice,  but that's how a language should be. His class is a mixture of reading, writing, and speaking. Show up to class well-practiced and you will LOVE Professor Xu. </div></div></div></body></html>
