She seems pretty nice but sometimes she will stare people down if the leave or come in late. If you come to class on time everyday, do the homework and take notes you will be fine.

Avoid her. I am an AB student and she was the worst professor I have ever had. The homework makes no sense and does not pertain to anything taught in class. She doesn't take many questions and singles out 1 or 2 students from the class for all participation. I also cannot understand a word she says either because she' foreign. AVOID.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2015<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid this class.

She is tough, but a fair grader. The exams are hard but she is giving a lot of extra points. Anyway, If she sees you work you will easily get an A. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/25/2014<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was a very difficult class, but put in the effort, and you will receive an A. ECO 105 was not fairly difficult. I did use the book when I did not understand her because of her thick Polish accent. She can be humorous at times. Will pick on random students to talk at times. She is definitely a challenging teacher, but I learned so so much!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2014<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take her. She takes vey few notes on the board and then tells you to write things down but says the thing really fast. I asked her for help and she just told me to talk to her after class, I wanted to sit down and discuss things. Unless your really crazy about Macro this is not the class for you it is so hard and boring. Over all worst class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2014<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a very smart woman and a good professor. Not the easiest but she gives out extra credit. Learned a lot from her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2014<br>Class Name: MACRO<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a very intense woman.  She has a strong accent, but it doesn't get in the way of her teaching.  She is a good professor, but only if you are willing to come to class, pay attention, and take copious notes.  She tells you exactly what to expect on midterm and final.  Recommend if you are a good student.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2014<br>Class Name: ECO202Z<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was very challenging, but I was able to learn a lot.I would take this teachers courses again, but I would try to avoid taking her on a Friday if possible.There is a lot of information to process in a short period of time.  If you try you will do good, and gain a good amount of knowledge, which is the most important thing in education.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2014<br>Class Name: ECON315<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Everything said previously about this professor is true. She is extremely hard to understand most of the time and I was terrified of failing this class. If you can take another professor for ECON 315, I'd recommend it. Even though she can seem cruel at times, she does care about her students, she wants them to succeed. She just doesn't make it easy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2013<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE. Though she has a thick accent, her English is easy to understand. She herself knows what she is doing, has a PhD, but SHE FAILS TO RELAY INFORMATION TO THE CLASS IN A CLEAR AND UNDERSTANDABLE MANNER. Raises her voice to students when they do not understand instead of offering to clarify the concepts. I got a C in the class. DO NOT TAKE</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2013<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Ziolowska is an extremely nice lady who is willing to go out of her way to help her students. I was demoralized after taking the mid-term and receiving a poor grade. She reached out to me outside of the class and helped clarify things in her office hours. Very helpful and nice lady. I'd take her again if it wasn't my last ECO requirement.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2013<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Won't let you use BR. If you ask questions in class, she'll give you a slight attitude & say " I just spent the entire class discussing that i am not repeating it". Explains pretty well at fast pace except has accent that u have to get use to. Doesn't give enough time to finish tests SO HURRY! No BOOK necessary. You take notes the entire class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2013<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I suggest not taking this teacher unless you have to. I shoot for an A in my classes & with her I didn't stand a chance. She is very difficult to please. She will not even cut you slack on homework, so don't count on those to help your grade. She will not answer questions in class & doesn't even allow you to get up to use the washroom. STAY AWAY</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2013<br>Class Name: ECN105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very hard to understand her accent. I really advice avoiding her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2013<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was a good teacher. PLENTY of extra credit. Grades based off of 8 HW assignements (each of which include extra credit) midterm, and final. Final HW assignment is extra credit, plus any in class (sometimes group) work is extra credit too. Slight language barrier, but very funny as times and cares about the students. I would take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2013<br>Class Name: ECON315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Thick accent but a great teacher. She writes out everything so everyone can understand. Have to work hard but the grade will be worth it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2013<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is honestly the worst teacher I have ever had. She has an accent so thick that you literally cant understand her and she is just a rude person, she takes off points if you stand up in class. Whatever you do do not take her you will regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2013<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take this woman's class.  Her accent is so thick that you can't understand a word she's saying.  She will treat you like a child, and will mock you openly if you choose to leave the classroom to use the washroom.  I don't know how she ever got hired.  Thank god econ105 is common sense, because I didn't learn a thing from this woman.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/10/2013<br>Class Name: ECON509<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You'll get used to the accent over time, but you won't get used to her teaching style. She may know economics, but she does not know how to teach. She will ramble on and on, the course is disorganized and I don't think she has a good enough grasp of English to explain economic concepts clearly. Very nice woman, but I disappointed with the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her class will teach you economics: YES YOU WILL LEARN! She has a system with her homework and course outlines that seriously allows you to learn and re-visit covered material in a VERY EASY WAY. She also uses an older book that you can download as a pdf via Google search! She has a Polish accent but you can understand what is taut. Recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2013<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Irena is a very brilliant economist. However, she cannot teach it so that students will understand it. And they keep giving her 3 or 4 sections in which to make students confused and distressed over material that should be interesting and exciting to learn. I think they should let her go and hire some new folks. AVOID!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are willing to pay attention in every class, take good notes, and study for exams, you can easily get an A. She can be hard to understand sometimes, but she does know what she is talking about. She answers all Qs in class and during office hours. Only take her if you are willing to work. If you are Polish, you are almost guaranteed an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is impossible to understand and bounce around thoughts while teaching. I had to teach myself through the book and classmates.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2013<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is probably the worst professor I've had so far. It is not a hard class but you have to learn everything on your own. She has a REALLY strong accent. It is very hard to follow her lectures. she gives you the study guide for the mid term and final with the same exact questions you will see on the exams. Make sure to do all questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2012<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is very intelligent and that is very clear. She knows what she's talking about. While all these comments are very extreme about her, I would like to point out that if you read the chapters, do the homework, and pay attention in class, there is no reason why you shouldn't do well in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2012<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Irena is just AWFUL! To think I am paying THOUSANDS to put up with this. She talks towards the chalkboard and is hard to follow. We formed a study group and that was the ONLY way we all made it through. The time we had to devote to the class because of her inability to teach made us all VERY angry and disappointed in DPU! Avoid her like the PLAGUE.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2012<br>Class Name: ECON555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sorry to say this, but steer clear.  She knows Econ, but not an effective graduate level prof.  Very hard to understand, crams too much material in, and did not effectively prepare us for the mid term.  I dropped the class after getting bad grade on mid term and ate the cost and now taking 555 with much better prof.A's in all my other MBA classes..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2011<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i also have to admit it was really hard to follow in her class lectures because of her accent. so just pay really close attention and write everything down that she writes down in the board. in addition she always had class notes on d2l, so you have three resources to do hw. but it is a little extra work on your part.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2011<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As polite and funny as she can sometimes be, I could barely understand what she said because of her thick polish accent. I had to re-read a lot of the stuff she taught. Also, she'll call on you if you leave in the middle of class to take a phone call or whatever. Overall an okay teacher. Just do the homework and you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2010<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>don't believe all these reviews.  yes, she does tend to talk towards the chalkboard and is kinda hard to follow at times, but for the most part she's not TOO bad.  if u read the book you'll do fine, i had over 100% for almost the entire quarter until i forgot to do 1 hw assignment!  she says &quot;just&quot; every other word tho, thats annoying!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2010<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor was very difficult to understand, not easy to grasp concept of class due to style of teaching.

This was a complete waste of time. She is absolutely incomprehensible, and its hard to believe DePaul or any institution that relies on communication would hire her.

She has had no real-world job experience.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2008<br>Class Name: ECON555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR..EVER!she can't speak english, very hard to understand her.She doesn't answer questions clearly, gets confused what she is talking about. makes mistakes in calculation all the time.seems like she has no idea what she is doing.doesn't deliver in her lectures, but gives tricky exams and doesn't curve.AVOID HER AT ANY CAUSE!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/14/2008<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Prof. Z. for both ECO 105 and 106 and they were tough. She is highly demanding and difficult to understand at times but she sure knows what she's talking about. She covers more topics in this class than she should but it she makes every other econ class at DePaul a breeze. Take her if you want to be prepared and you'll thank yourself later.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/18/2008<br>Class Name: ECOXXXX<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dear XXX, maybe your terrible work ethic has something to do with your terrible grade. You just cannot expect to be given a high grade because all your other courses were easy. You have to work at each and every one of them. Dr. Ziolkowska was a great teacher and I think you do her a disservice by not taking responsibility for you own learning!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/10/2008<br>Class Name: ECONXXX<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was by far the worst teacher I had.Prior to this class I was a straight A student, I got the lowest grade I haver ever received from this woman. She has a terrible accent, and she speaks in a monotone voice every single lecture. Do not take her, by far she is the only instructor that was close to ruining my college experience.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2008<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Ziolkowska has been my favorite professor at DePaul over the 5 years I have been here. She is friendly and was always available for extra help after class. While she does have an accent, who among the students here or any good school does not&#63; Her exams are straight from the study guide. She gives lots of useful homework as review. Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2008<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I strongly reccomend that students avoid having her as a teacher. She is extremely hard to understand and even when you can understand something she says it doesn't make sense. She's not very helpful and is rude to people who don't understand the class even though most people can't even tell what she is saying. She should not be teaching at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2008<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has a very heavy accent and she demands a LOT of solid work. you need to read the book every night to keep up and understand what shes attempting to say. bonus is not weighted, do the homework! hard class, lots of hw    and very hard tests. wouldnt suggest her to the average student.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2008<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this is by far the worst teacher i have ever had. TAKE MY ADVICE...avoid her! She speaks with a low voice, not to mention her accent is annoying becuase she keeps saying &quot;just&quot; every 2 seconds. She takes points off for things she never mentioned, and is a very poor grader. Her midterm and quizzes are hard not to mention the letures are    useless.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2008<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she knows what shes saying and is very intelligent but its impossible to understand her with her accent. She's very rude when you ask her for help as well.

Despite what she says, purchase the book -- ITS YOUR ONLY HOPE.  Don't expect to do well in this course.  I haven't ever had a grade this low and I was studying engineering.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2007<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a horrible teacher. She doesn't reply to your emails at all. And every time you ask her a question, she'll go on and on talking about something else. She also ignores raised hands in class. She also locks the door so students that leave the classroom to go to the bathroom can't come back in. So far, the worst teacher I have had</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2007<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very difficult to understand; however, she curves your grade tremendously, if you show up for the majority of the classes. After the final I was supposed to get a C+, with her curve I ended with an A!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I feel bad for her because her english is so terrible she can't convey her intelligence to her students. You can tell she knows what she's talking about, the problem is that it's hard to learn from her. I got an A, but that's because she curved</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes a nice person, but she doesn't explain the material clearly at all. Lectures are boring and extremely confusing at times. She gave us homework, but rarely explained how to do it BEFORE it was due. The book didn't help much either. The quizzes and exams are pretty difficult, and she sometimes didn't even give us enough time to do the quizzes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2006<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While probably too hard for Micro, she is genuinely nice and cares about her students. Bonus points for attendance so show up. Weekly quizzes, homework, midterm, final, and two projects.  People gave her a really hard time, but she tried.  Other professors may be easier, but its still pretty easy to get an A. Be prepared to work a little harder.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is hard to understand (broken english), not very clear in lectures, also not very clear when you ask questions.  Mid-term average was a 75%. She gives a study guide with 48 of the 65 questions on the mid-term, Final study guide not as helpful.  If you are good at econ, go for it, if you need extra help, try someone else.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2006<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
