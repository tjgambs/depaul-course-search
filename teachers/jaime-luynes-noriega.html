I have him for consumer behavior at U of I in Champaign. He is extremely condescending to his students, does not admit when he is wrong, and will make students pay for his mistakes.

It is his way or no way. He will never admit he's wrong or incorrect, will just argue with you. Tests are very tricky and confusing!

A very simple subject that he complicates-it's consumer behavior! Tests are filled with tricky questions and class discussions are not reflective of what's tested.

I didn't think I'd pass it quite honestly.  But he is a great professor.  The tests are near impossible but if you study up and show improvement, he WILL recognize that.  + for making special arrangements and being very available. Also + for allowing tons of in class discussion!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2009<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>stay away from this guys..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2009<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am a marketing major, and I have mostly A's in other classes... I got a B in this man's class. He tries to appear that he cares, but really he just doesn't get it. He gives really hard grades, and the test questions are impossible. After projects he tears apart every group on what they did wrong, I don't know how anyone will get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2009<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Noriega was probably the worst professor I have had at DePaul. He did not seem to want his students to succeed at all. He loved to point out faults and how wrong people are and not in a constructive way. I think he wants his students to fail. DO NOT TAKE HIM! He is terrible!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2009<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>one of the worst profs. at depaul...mid-term and final was harrrrrrdd and tricky doesn't help the students and please avoid him at all cost</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2008<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just finished finals, have to say everyone is pretty spot on, tricky questions on final, He's not really good at giving you a study guide or an idea of what is going to be on the final, took all of the quizzes did not help much, the class average was 75 with a curve. Be prepared to figure it out on your own, don't miss any classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2008<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Told class that there would be no tricky questions on the final but that was a complete lie.  Besides the mid-term and final it was a pretty easy class.  I reccommend doing every extra credit because exams are very tough.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2008<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is not a &quot;blow off&quot; class, for those of you Fin/Acc majors who do not take other courses seriously..look elsewhere. He does a great job in conveying pertinent info. and is always more than willing to adress issues or concerns pertaining to the class. Exams aren't that bad. I recomend taking him if you want to learn if not; keep on looking.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2008<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked prof. noriega, until the final. The midterm isn't bad if you study, but I did the same studying procedure for the final and it slaughtered my grade by one whole letter. As everyone is saying, you will not get the grade you deserved.

Midterm and Final are really tough. There is right ansewre it is the best of the right ansewres. I hate when teachers do that. Group project is cake, but its not worth taking.

Quizes are open book and online. Group project is easy. The final and midterm are what will get you. This guy contridicts himslef, he has no idea what hes talking about. There's better marketing teachers! *Will not get grade you deserve.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2008<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take him if you want a fair grade. The class isn't too difficult but he's extremely picky with grading and chooses the most obscure test questions. 2 Quizzes every week were a pain to keep up with. Expect to get one grade below what you deserve; he only gave 4 A's last quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2008<br>Class Name: MK310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I recommend him. I am not a marketing major, but i really enjoyed the class and the professor. Do study for the mid-term and the final. The final group project is not that bad.

He wants you to think outside of the box; plus he offers tons of extra credit.

This guy is hardcore on technical stuff, not what is expected from a marketing class. As for exams, yfor some of the questions..you can study everything and still get it wrong. It's testing your test taking ability more than your knowledge of the material. Extremely tricky and impossible at times.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2008<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His lectures are so-so. He definatly asks tricky questions that at times, feel impossible to answer (after he calls on half the class to answer). My main problem with him were his tests, he does say study everything, but study, &quot;concepts.&quot; Not too easy for one of your first MKT courses. Nice guy though!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2008<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His lectures are so-so.

If you want to laugh, ask him whats on the test.  Answer: pretty much everything. This guy puts everyone to sleep and he uses the trickest question just to confuse the students.  He is a very technical man and makes marketing very, very boring. If your in need of sleep, take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2007<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great teacher although sometimes confusing when he asks you to omit something but it shows up on the quiz. but he'll go back and fix it. very very easy to get points in his class, his extra credit is write summary of five articles and he adds 5% to your grade.i was at a 87 with quizzes, midterm and final etc.cause i did 4 E.C i got 91 in the class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2007<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had mixed feelings when I registered for his class,b/c of some of these ratings.  But I'm glad I stuck with it. He is not boring and has a lot of experience in the Marketing field. Very nice guy, ask questions, show interest. Plus he offers a ton of extra credit! Not that you'lle really need it, considering we have open book quizes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2007<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked him and did learn alot from his class.He tried extremely hard to get students involved and motivated.

Quiz answers come word for word from the book. Test questions sometimes will have multiple legitimate answers (sometimes he will have answers that contradict the book) likes to take &quot;cop-outs&quot; when they don't line up. I would not recommend. Plus class is really boring!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2007<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is really nice and will always help if you ask. His quizes are open book, the exams come directly from the chapters, I don't see why so many people are complaining. He will tell you what to study,he can't simplify it any further.You gotta be dumb if you do badly in his class. Students just dont care anymore and want to blame it on him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2007<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've had worse professors than Noriega, he's actually a blessing in disguise.His exams are not impossible, they just require you to actually study like most classes do. He will  tell you waht to omit or what to know, grow up guys.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2007<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the worst professors I have had in my 3 years at DePaul. He's terrible at explaining anything, is totally unknowledgeable, and creates exam questions that not only fail to test one's understanding of course concepts, but are worded so confusingly that one is almost guaranteed to get it wrong no matter how much studying they do.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2007<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's great for this particular course because he practically tells you what to expect on exams,study his side notes. A lot of students just see an answer that looks correct and get it wrong beacuse they don't pay attn., or just skim the book. Noriega is a smart man, he makes it easy on us,but he's also aware that we are in college.Recomend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2007<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class blows, there are quizes(not open book) everyday, dont miss any quizes since it will hurt your grade, so attendance is near mandatory. The exams are not that hard, just study a lot. He adds tricky questions to the exams, which are rather unfair, over 75% of the class will get them wrong(he told us).Get an 'A' do all of the extra credit</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2007<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher isnt my favorite at all, but his cl**** is not too hard, if your good at multiple choice then your golden. Your grade consists of a mc-quiz everyday, a group presentation, attendence, participation, small ****ignments, and midterm/final.

He gets very technical with terms and does not explain what they really mean.  He is a hard greader.

Quiz everyday, and you cover the entire book! 16 chapters in 10 weeks. Very unclear on his assignments, and he's the toughest grader ever!

Very helpful guy that offers extra credit, curves on exam, and drops lowest quiz grade. Knows his stuff and can explain it well. There are daily quizzes, but they are all open book. Attendence not require, but he remembers who is there or not and who leaves early. Overall, you must take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2007<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this dude is awesome. he hands out the quiz at the start of class on you do not have to turn it in until the end, plus you get to use your book. just a real straight-forward guy with a lot of interest in the material and he makes it fun. i do not say this often, but if you have the chance to take this guy, do it, i GUARENTEE you will like him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2007<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He gives quizes evrydy so u pretty much have to show up to class.
