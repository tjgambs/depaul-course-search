Her classes are almost too easy, though, and class work can become tedious and repetitive. But at the same time, she shows films often, incorporates Italian culture, and genuinely cares about her students succeeding. Overall I would definitely recommend this professor, if anything for the easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2012<br>Class Name: ITA101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher!
