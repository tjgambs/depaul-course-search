The stack of articles was 3.5 inches thick plus there were 8 paperback books to read. Very hard to understand sometimes because she failed to make the readings more cohesive with each other, a text would have done that. No response to e-mails even though she told us to send.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2004<br>Class Name: ECE290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very helpful and always is willing to help her students.  Just read everything she tells you for class, even though it is a bit long.  She is also very approachable if you have any questions and very easy to get a hold of.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2003<br>Class Name: ECE290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is very interesting. The teacher is very clear and precise and wants to help her students. If you read the material you will get an A.
