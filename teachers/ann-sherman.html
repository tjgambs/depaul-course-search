And 5 writing assignments. She expects you to stay for lecture after midterms because she schedules 2 and doesn't want to miss 2 lectures. Why not just have 1 midterm then? Also, her assignments and emails may as well be novels. Avoid!!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2014<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The first midterm is pretty much questions like the myfinancelab hw. She lets you use a cheatsheet so just write down the questions on there (it helps!). The second midterm also has questions that are similar to myfinancelab; however there are some conceptual and some problems that require thinking and understanding. The final was the hardest one. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2013<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Sherman is a very good professor. She goes the extra mile for her students and is always sure to explain herself fully. She puts an emphasis on things you will actually need in the real world. 2 midterms, myfinancelab homework online, and a final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2013<br>Class Name: IPO<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a nice person but not sure if she is a great professor. The course did not have a text book so we had to rely heavily on the handouts. The questions on her test were so convoluted and confusing! She does not have a proper grading mechanism. If there are no marks alloted for case studies and group work, why bother assigning it to the class?!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/17/2012<br>Class Name: CORPFAAA<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sherman is awesome! Even though I walked away with a C+, it's very easy to get an A. She has all her HW thru myfinancelab and she even takes late work. Midterm and final based off in class problems worked out. She is really cool and interesting. Take it with her if you want to learn it all!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2012<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Material is bulky but Sherman makes it easy. Homework is on myfinancelab, which is all you need to know to pass the class. Exams are long(the entire class periods). Her MC & T/F are the most difficult part & can decide your exam score from an A to B.  Very easy to get a good grade.  Also notes sheet of anything you want for exams & NO TEXTBOOK!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2012<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, all homework and quizzes are done online, and test questions are derived from online material. If you have her, do not get the book, it is unused. Any and everything can be found online without a book. You get a page front and back per each of 2 midterms for notes, and 2 pages front and back for final. Very cool, easy and you learn</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2012<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>her class is not hard. hw on myfinancelab (easy to get 100%), 2 exams, final. she lets you use a sheet of notes for the exams, and 2 for the final. takes problems right from the hw. just put the problems on your note sheet and you will get an A. she also gives hints in class what will be on the exams. do not buy the book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2011<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>take her.dont buy book.2exams+final,all &#63;s come from online hwk +quizzes,lets you use note sheet on exams. very easy to do well in class. tells you exactly whats on test as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2011<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her class put me over the edge and got me to switch out of finance. Extremely unhelpful and confusing. Assumes you know more about FIN than you probably do at the point you're in 311. Unless you're really into FIN and know a lot about it, I would definitely stay far, FAR away. Comes off as nice but press the wrong button and she'll snap hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2010<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her teaching consists of all powerpoint slides but she gives you the slides on notes.  She won't throw you a curve ball on the midterm and final and she does let you use a one sheet page of notes.  Questions on exam are taken DIRECTLY from homework online.  Put all the homework on that paper, and your straight</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2010<br>Class Name: FIN798<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It would be better if she follows a book than give  limited and concise notes. Her questions in exams are so confusing . She plays around with words and intentionally makes the language of the question very confusing. For God sake !! This is not GMAT or SAT. Very strict grader!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2010<br>Class Name: FIN798<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Sherman was great.  Her handouts were concise and lectures were engaging for an all day Saturday course.  The IPO & Venture Capital course was very interesting and ties in well if you have a Finance & Entrepreneurship double concentration.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2010<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her teaching style is different; You need to pay attention to the class and her tests are hard. If you don't go to class, don't bother taking her. Final exam can be tough for lots of people. most people didnt even finish.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2009<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Students can learn a lot from prof. Sherman.The class is an extended review of FIN310 and that's why you should make sure you remember the material.Tests were adequate and consistent with what the lectures,may be a little long, but she curves a lot and gives extra points.2 midterms,final,homework.I would definitely take another class with her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2009<br>Class Name: FIN798<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I truly enjoyed the Venture Capital & IPOs class.  If this area is of interest to you, I would recommend taking this course.  The professor is very engaging, cares about her students learning and extremely knowledgable in this area.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2009<br>Class Name: FIN398<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of BEST DePaul professors. Very competent; engaging speaker; genuinely cares about her students. She teaches relevant material to the real-world by means of cases and presentations. I took her &quot;IPO's and Venture Capital&quot; class, and I highly recommend it.</div></div></div></body></html>
