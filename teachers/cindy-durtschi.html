Durtschi is as good as an accounting professor as you can get. I took Heltzer & I failed. She was TERRIBLE. But Prof. Durtschi is so nice and helpful. To do well in accounting, regardless of your professor, you have to put in the work. She is as easy as possible. Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2013<br>Class Name: ACC101H<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great lady, Great class, no issues at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2013<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really enjoyed her class, and she helped me out even after the class ended with recommendations and things.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2013<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is helpfully and very willing to meet and explain problems in detail. You have to pay attention during class, so don't sit next to your BFF. You must study for this class, NO accounting is going to be an easy A. I spent 2 hours a week studying and I made an A. She is polite and I enjoyed her class very much. DO XTRA CREDIT!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2012<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful person, awful teacher. Prpare to teach yourself the information.  She knows her stuff but does NOT explain well.  One of the worst accounting teachers in the department.  If you take her, get a tutor outside of class to help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2011<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>true that she did go vey fast, but also wanted her students to get A's. kind of tied down as how to teach the class as all ACC 101 is the same for each class (final, workload etc.) helped review for final plus 1 easy and interesting project. took accounting in high school so it was easy for me. she isnt the worst teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2011<br>Class Name: ACC798<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Forensic and Investigative accounting with Professor Durtchi.  Her class was among the most valuable/fun at DePaul. Her fraud case project, though difficult at first, put you in a real-life situation forcing you to solve a fraud case.  I thought she placed too much emphasis on attendance, but I would recommend her, overall.  Learned a ton!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2011<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly, in this ACC 101 class the teacher is only there to grade your work.  She is a very easy grader but when it comes to teaching she goes way to fast and doesn't really explain everything too well.  She's willing to help if you need it though.  Just read the book, practice, go to the labs and you will at least be able to get a B+.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2011<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took her financial II and she rushed through everything like she was in a hurry to leave. would get annoyed if people asked questions. class consists of midterm and final worth 45%, 55% respectively of your final grade. i didnt mind the class since i'm pretty much cpa ready but it was annoying how she would randomly call on people</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2011<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i genuinely feel sorry for myself and everyone that has taken her. financial accounting is not supposed to be difficult if you know basic math, but when you have a professor who can't teach.. you've got a problem. i'd take murphy, someone who has a phD and extensive accounting industry exprience, over her anyday.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2011<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prepare for your GPA to drop. She has &quot;favorites&quot; who she picks based on who she thinks will make it in the accounting industry. She favors adult students (those that already have industry experience and return to college to get their degrees) She is very rude to real students. DO NOT take.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2011<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's a pretty cool professor who genuinely tries to make sure her students know the material. and low key, she kinda cute doe. honestly, she's really only there to supplement the material. to do well in acc101, all you really have to do is read the book and go to the labs and study them!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2011<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this was a terrible class... my fault for picking her based off her acc 101 ratings. it turned out her 300 level accounting classes were whole different ball game. she is very disorganized and only reads from power points. there was weekly homewokr due which counted for only 5% of final grade. atendance is mandeitory. no curve for tests</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2011<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The immature 'kids' need to grow up. This is a senior level class, don't expect it to be a breeze. As an adult returning to school, I can say she was a pleasure. It was hard no doubt but if you spend 8-10 hours outside of class studying, you will pass. My only problem was she provides no reviews for the midterm and final. Tests are VERY tricky.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2011<br>Class Name: ACC350<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TO SAVE YOUR GPA DO NOT TAKE HER -- The highest grade in our entire class was a C. Even the students with 4.0's could not get higher than a C. Her class is designed not to pass, just one of those prof. Honestly, take the other instructor. She must comment on her own site because she is simply the worst instructor... you wont learn/pass her class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2011<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As a senior graduating this spring, I was saving all my hard accounting classes for the end. This professor was acclaimed to be the easiest for 308, and it turned out she was very difficult. I have a 3.8 GPA in accounting, and this is the first accounting class I failed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I failed this class the first time, so when I took it again I expected it to be just as tough. However this was not the case! I very much enjoyed Prof Durtschi and she didn't care if we showed up for the last 3 weeks!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2010<br>Class Name: ACC545<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her lectures are not very helpful, so make sure you do all the homework and in-class assignments. If you study yourself - read the books and in class notes, you will be get a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/30/2010<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very nice and always tries to make things clear. Very helpful when you have a question. Way easier than 304-306. The material is difficult but she makes it easier to understand. The final is harder than the midterm so make sure you practice the question you do in class and the homework and you will be fine. Take her, NOT Murphy!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2010<br>Class Name: ACCT545<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her class is not too helpful, so read the textbook. Make sure do your homework and practice yourself. I am not a very smart guy, but I got 90 in Mid-term and 100 in Final. So just study yourself, and you will be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2010<br>Class Name: ACCT101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Accounting 101 is a class where you can get by solely by reading the textbook.  The professor is there to lecture if you need additional explaining or examples.  The midterm and finals are the same for all 101 classes and make up 75% of your grade, and are fairly difficult. Attendance is not mandatory but Prof. Durtschi is good at explaining acc.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor I have ever had at DePaul. She's nice but she does not know what she's talking about! When she would do problems the whole class would correct her and have to walk her through it. In one problem, I counted her make 8 mistakes. You're pretty much on your own if you take Durtschi. ACC 101 is hard enough, don't take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good accounting 101 teacher. Works through examples of what you need to know,follow along and you should understand the material. Not hard on you, does not care if you attend or not. Unfortunatley, you grade is pretty much up to the departmental mid-term and final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Teacher! One of the best in the accounting apartment  and to take accounting 101. She does as much as possible to help you raise your grade unlike other accounting classes. She puts a 1% extra credit which no one else offers for accounting 101. She also is extremely helpful and wants you to learn the material and get a good grade!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2010<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>PLEASE RATE!!!!</div></div></div></body></html>
