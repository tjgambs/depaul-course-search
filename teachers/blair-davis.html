He is such a nice sweet guy! He always brought us snacks and kept the energy high which is so important for a night class.  He's really fun but just slightly hard. No tests, just two papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2011<br>Class Name: MCS349<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Blair knows an awful lot about his subject, and he presents the material in a nuanced, engaging manner.
