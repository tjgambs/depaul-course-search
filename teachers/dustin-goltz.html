He is really passionate about performance and creates a space where you are able to truly make the class your own. Though this was a challenging course, it was very rewarding and a unique alternative to the standard public speaking course... He was very responsive and helpful!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lots of busy work for this course, not a bad class overall. For an online course he assigned some interaction (reply to another students post, etc) which wasn't bad. Some areas of the course were boring but not a bad class overall. Made for a decent online class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2015<br>Class Name: INTC230<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's either you love this class or you hate it. The performance aspect of this class was really cool. The class also focuses on lecturing and assignments which are tedious since it's just busy work. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/14/2014<br>Class Name: INTC230<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I LOVE Prof. Goltz!!! I've taken two of his classes already. He's incredibly smart and entertaining, and he really appreciates participation (which is pretty much inevitable in his classes.) I would strongly recommend him- he can make any discussion interesting. He's also adorable, hilarious, and quirky.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: INTC230<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Didn't expect to, but loved this class. I learned a lot that I can use. Dusty does expect you to show up and work, but he seems to care a lot, will help you through it,  and makes the class well worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/09/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Way too much work. Not worth it. Stay away. The quizzes are very tough. Relies heavily on textbook and podcasts - be sure to study everything! Teaches you that everybody oppresses you instead of teaching you to be the boss of your own life. The teacher talks way too much about his homosexuality. I learned nothing useful at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2012<br>Class Name: INTC330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take this professor. He is more often than not incomprehensible. He claims to give you tools, but they aren't helpful enough to do the assignments asked of you. He will ask you to apply extremely dense, sometimes nonsensical, identical theories in ways he hasn't prepared you for. If you don't get it, he won't care. You'll live to regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/28/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class I took was supposed to  be about multiculturalism and all he talked about was his homosexuality. Repetitive, time consuming class where I learned next to nothing. Could be good for a different subject, but not this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2011<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best Professor at DePaul. He asks the impossible from us. In the end it is worth it! Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2011<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly one of the most informative scholars in his field.  Completely willing to discuss material in greater depth outside of class.  Encourages participation...just be thoughtful.  Definitely take his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/24/2011<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Too much class participation...detracts from the texts, making it difficult to decipher what we will be tested on.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2010<br>Class Name: CMN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Life changing class. No joke. Ive never taken a performance class although i was familiar with the topics upon entering the class. Dusty challenges you and creates a classroom environment and openess that cannot be put into words. Learned so much and would love to take many more courses with him. So greatful for this class experience. A must take!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2010<br>Class Name: CMNS230<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fantastic teacher! Even though he challenges you, he is always helpful and tries to make the classroom setting as fun as possible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2009<br>Class Name: ISP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT PROFESSOR!!! So funny and willing to help. Do all readings, and quizzes are a breeze. Make sure to be open minded. Performance art was the best class I have ever taken with the best professor I have ever had. You deserve your chili pepper, Dusty!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2009<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>explore chicago: performance art. not gonna lie-class was hard to swallow at first. but overtime it gets interesting. IF YOU ARE NOT OPEN-MINDED, DO NOT TAKE THE CLASS. controversial topics are discussed. dusty treated us like adults and class was fun (just a little long). if you wanna learn more about performance art, definitely take.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2009<br>Class Name: CMNS509<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher: fun, laid back, very passionate, well-read, knowledgeable, makes the material clear and interesting, class discussions are engaging, time flies in Dusty's class.

Period. Dusty is really laid back and fun. He's a great professor and really gets the class involved in the material he's teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2009<br>Class Name: COM308<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best classes I have taken. I worked really hard in it, but I got a lot out of the course. He is difficult, some of his test questions are hard, but a great teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2009<br>Class Name: CMNS230<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dusty is very laid-back and likes to change the way one thinks about performance. Great, fun class. A little bit of reading. Some pop quizes. He likes to get you to use your body & be active within the classroom - not lecture style at all. Very good professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: CMN308<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Okay. Not great. Can be difficult. HAVE TO READ HAVE TO. He places random quotes on the test and you have to identify the author.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2008<br>Class Name: COM230<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fun class.
