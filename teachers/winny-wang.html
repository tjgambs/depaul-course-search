I got a B and I still don't know how to design a webpage. The class wasn't helpful to me, but someone into computers may like it. Winny was very helpful with assignments, but I wouldn't take it again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2008<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Winny is awesome!! I learned so much about web design, and it was a very easy class. I would only recommend this class to people who have at least a firm grasp on using computers or it might be a little hard to follow since she moves very fast.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2007<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Winny is so amazing! She is a little fast, but she does stop and help you with the work. She is really excited about web authoring. She made me excited and I am not a CTI majour. Take her class if you need a fairly easy science requirement.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2007<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this instuctor is awesome...I didnt know what I was doing..but somehow ended up with an A.

Difficult to take as a summer class but this teacher makes it very easy to learn a lot in a short period of time.  Very helpful and willing to meet outside of class. a bit of a language barrier since she has a thick accent but once you get used to it, she is great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2006<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Winny rocks!

She's sooooooo cute, very helpful and a great prof. She is a bit hard to understand and does go a little fast sometimes but you can stop her anytime for help. Most of the assignments I did in class as she was doing them, midterm was easy and the final project is your website. I learned a lot and it was fun. TAKE HER!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2006<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't think it's a tough class.
