He does not even have a grading scale on his syllabus. Therefore, he gives you whatever grade he feels like. Test weren't that difficult if you studied. Did not learn anything from him. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2015<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take anyone but Deli! Lectures are long and straight off the powerpoint. Is not clear and does not help you at all. This course was a waste of time as I learned nothing from him. You're better off reading the textbook and teaching yourself. 2 midterms and  a final. Avoid!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2014<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>His lectures are well-prepared, even though it may seem like he's winging it.  His exams are all problem-based with no multiple choice, and I thought his grading was a bit harsh.  I don't regret taking him for this class, but I'm not sure if I would take him for another class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2014<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Deli is fair and explains things well. It can be dry, so paying attention in class isn't always easy. Watch the D2L videos before exams and study the homework problems -- they show up on the exams. He allows a formula sheet and grades generously. You'll get points simply for attempting a problem.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2014<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A bit dry when teaching. He jumps so fast from one subject to another so you need to keep on top of everything. A hard grader in exams but helpful if you have any questions. Overall it was an OK class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/15/2013<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Deli is a  bit dry with a quirky sense of humor, but he's very knowledgeable of the subject. I took it during the summer, so class was very rushed. His tests are fair/straight-forward and he gives you more than enough material to prepare for it. The course is pretty much standardized so the amount of work won't vary much. I'd recommend Deli.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2012<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bottom line: take Deli for Finance. I went into this clss dripping with fear but he sets reasonable expectations and his exams are more than fair. Lectures were very helpful. There isn't enough breathing room between second exam and last two case studies but that isn't Deli's issue; it's the department's. Don't fall behind. It'll bite you later on.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/29/2010<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I absolutely hate Finance classes.  I dreaded this class but Deli made it OK.  He is a fair grader on his exams--just make sure you study the recommended review questions and understand what he goes over in class and you can get an A. He is always available in his office and always helps.  Take Deli if you want the least amount of pain in FIN</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2010<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hate FIN, but this class was ok. Prof knows most aren't going to FIN majors, so he adjusts to that. Study and it'll be okay. He is a little awkward sometimes, but all in all, he means well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2010<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For those who are not finance minded people, Deli is not a bad professor to take for FIN 555.  He has a very good understanding of the material and tries to teach intuition rather than just math.  There's work to be done outside of class but overall a good professor to take.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2009<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I couldn't disagree more with the other comment about Professor Deli in Finance 555. I was at the same class (it was his first class at DePaul)I got an A, I do not have prior experience nor any degree in finance, and I didn't have a better professor than Deli so far at DePaul. He's very helpful,friendly and gives a lot of real life examples.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2009<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doesn't show any interest to get deep into the subject of Corporate Finance.  Rarely, did he answer student;s questions relating to the current financial markets.  All theory and NO Real-life experience.  Only reason I did well is my prior Finance work experience.  It was obvious that most of the students in the class felt lost. Would not recommend</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2009<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was his first quarter teaching at DePaul, so didn't know exactly what to expect. He basically reads everything off the powerpoint, and you have to teach yourself how to do most of the work. Does not assign homework, but also does not go over any problems or questions in class. If you can teach yourself, than take the class.</div></div></div></body></html>
