Nice woman. Relied on film a bit too much during class.

She explains things well,available for help anytime, & is just an overall nice lady. Course work not that heavy (just one project you work on entire qurter) and 2 easy (multiple choice exams). I'd take a class with her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2012<br>Class Name: PS101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her for public speaking.
