Just show up for class & do the hw even though it's not mandatory bc the biweekly exams and final is just like the hw problems. Exams are really short. Even if you're not a math person, just follow his steps in class and don't be afraid to as questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2015<br>Class Name: MATH136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>MAT 136 is harder than 135.  He's willing to help during offfice hours and does probelms on paper to give you.  Tests are like the hw and final is like the tests literally.  Also they are really short, but not multiple choice. He is clear when explaining stuff but you need to ask him! Goes over everything but tells you what is on the exams. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2015<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>4 Tests and 1 Final. Clear and straight-forward. Very direct individual. Classes are usually quiet and mostly lecture. Textbook is utilized and good for reviewing before exams.  A slight personal hygiene issue; perhaps sit in the middle area of the classroom.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2015<br>Class Name: BUSCALC135<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great math professor gives good review problems. FInal isn't that bad either.  4 quizzes and 1 final.  His personality is a little hard to get used to but he's a good guy overall.  Focus in class. He  goes over a lot in class if you aks him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2015<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If Math isn't your strong suit, DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. Rude to students when asked questions - he rolls his eyes. Only 4 tests the whole quarter - ridiculous. The final counts for 40% of your grade. Moves at a very fast pace and expects students to know most of the criteria already. Grades HARD and takes off for small unimportant marks.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2015<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You must attend class in order to understand the material. It may seem as if he is not willing to answer questions, but I don't think it's intentional. He always answers questions and goes over hwexams. Explains further with examples if most of the class is struggling. Put in the work, HW isn't mandatory, but DO IT!!! Practice makes perfect. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2014<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: C+</div><div id="right"><div>Very emotionless- seems like he hates his life and teaching. Stats was hard for me. He did nothing to engage the class and it was difficult to keep up. Easy in terms of grade- Online Homework due at the end of the quarter and attendance isn't mandatory.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2014<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Miller is a great teacher! He explains everything very clearly, and only assigns homework problems that we have covered in class. He also goes over any homework questions in the next class, which is super helpful! The bi-weekly exams and the final exam are exactly like the homework problems he assigns. No surprises! Take him!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2013<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. Confuses himself sometimes. Does not grade homework (but I suggest you do it because it is exactly like what will be on the quzzes and final)nor makes attendance mandatory. Gives 4 quizzes and a final. Basically come to class and do your homework and you should be fine. Definitely taking him again for 136 and 137</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/05/2013<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want to simply pass stats, take him. Simple to pass. If you want to get an A, don't take him. Midterm was a joke but if you make the easiest mistake, he takes off. Final is a lot harder. Emotionless teacher. Didn't like him. Don't recommend him at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2013<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Oldschool, no bull style of teaching. Does not require you to attend lectures or to do homework; however, doing both will go a long way in helping you through the class. He explains things well in his lectures and gives you all the tools to succeed in his class;  since he is more old fashioned it is up to you to take advantage of what he provides.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>From my experience, Professor Miller teaches in a clear and easy way. He doesn't over complicate things, just wants you to understand the basics. But that doesn't mean you can just relax and not pay attention. One of the best classes if you pay attention, take notes and study for tests. Definitely would take him again if I had to.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible teacher. Doesn't care one bit about you. Teaching methods are outdated; he makes the concepts way more confusing than they are. Seriously can't teach effectively, I had to read the book for everything. Insanely picky grader, especially on the final quiz, which is INCREDIBLY HARD. Makes you work everything out on paper!! Do not take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2013<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Laid back, old school professor. Very picky on doing the correct notations. The class consists of 4 tests, but more like small quizzes. Homework isn't mandatory but I recommend you do it because the quizzes are just like the homework.

His monotone voice put me to sleep every class. He is often unclear and confuses even himself sometimes. Overall not too bad of a class, pretty easy as long as you do the hw you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2012<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You only need the book for the HW.

Pretty old school - doesn't bother learning names, only discusses class material, doesn't take attendance, doesn't grade the homework, 4 test and one final. Such a clear teacher. He has a gift at making this intro to calculus class interesting & easy to understand. Easy A if you go to class & give an honest effort.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2011<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've had about 6 different math teachers in my High School lifetime. This guy beats all of them. He repeats examples until you get them, and all the quizzes are based on homework (which he doesn't even check). Recommend 100%</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2011<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Miller is fantastic. He cuts through the bulk of the text seamlessly, focusing on the most important material (but still keeps it sequential).  He actually made me enjoy Calculus. A bit picky, but generally very reasonable and often gave me partial credit(e.g. for forgetting a negative sign). I'd take him again in a heartbeat.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2011<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is terrible so much homework.

Teaches math in a very easy way. Although I got a C in his class, I would take him again because the way he teached. No midterm or final, just 4 or 5 test. Easy tests about 5-10 problems and most are from class and hw. Attendance isn't mandatory, he does offer makeups if you missed exams. Just do the hw and you b fine</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2010<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher...very thorough and clear. Quizzes and exams consist of basic problems, just like the homework and examples that he gives.

I struggled in 135 but I'm doing great in his class.  He assigns homework daily but it's all review from what is taught in class. He uses a lot of examples and really explains everything clearly.

After dropping this class winter quarter for doing terrible on the midterm with another prof, I took him and ended up with an A-. Highly recommend him if you want to understand all of the concepts.

Yes, Miller does assign computer assignments, but they each take less than 10 minutes to do.  And he collects homework and has the computer assignments so that you can get easy points so if you bomb the final or midterm you can still  pass the class.  He is an excellent teacher, very clear!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2009<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is way too easy! I didnt buy the book and just went to 3/4 of the classes and finished with an A!

He assigns daily homework, which is not a lot, but he does not grade it or collect it.  There are 5 quizzes worth 60% of your grade and one final which is 40%.

There is almost homework everyday, but the homework is never collected. There are four quizzes worth 60% of the grade, which are easier than the homework. The final is worth 40% and is very similar to the quizzes.
