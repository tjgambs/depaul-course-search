Even though there are no textbooks, the pdf readings are dry, long and confusing. That's why it takes ages to read it. 2-3 moderate-to-long weekly readings may seem easy at first, but add on to that 3 mid length papers plus a midterm and a final and you get yourself a really time consuming class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2015<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I like her as a person, but not as an instructor.  Overall I didn't think the class was organized very well. She assigns a reading and then she summarizes it the next day in class, but I had no idea what I was supposed to take away at the end. One midterm and a final paper. Prob the best prof for HON201, just an not interesting class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2015<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring lectures, not a great professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2012<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty boring class, but not her fault. Decent enough professor for the subject. Just skim the readings and make sure you have a basic understanding of the concepts and you'll be fine. Test grading pretty harsh but paper grading she was really easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2011<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably the best choice for Honors 201.  She was MUCH tougher grading the first exam than she was on the second exam or the final papers. For a boring topic, her class isn't too bad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/26/2011<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Honors States, Markets and Societies with prof. Martinez. She knows the material well but needs a little help getting her message across.  The good news is she's very open to suggestions from the class about her teaching style.  Our class had 2 tests a 12 page paper and a presentation. Not easy, but a very interesting class. I recommend her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2009<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a big disappointment. The material was okay, her grading was okay. As a professor she could use some improvement. She criticized student opinions when their points were valid, and showed favoritism to others. In every class she would manage to bring up the fact that she had a PhD. Unnecessary.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2007<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing Teacher and Class!! Highly Reccomend! She is brilliant. Grade consists of 2 tests, 1 paper, 1 presentation (easy), participation. You learn a ton and it is challenging but not difficult (got an A). She helps you all of the time and wants to gear the class towards your intests (presentation & paper). Definitely take her!! The BEST!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2007<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>(SQ06) Martha was a pretty good teacher. Her accent was a little challenging at first, but she is super excited about the material. I found the class hard, but doable, and I ended up w/ a good grade. Taking the class w/ a friend and studying together/comparing notes REALLY helped.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2006<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her lectures are amazing!  I love this woman... she is my new god btw... her class is demanding but if you do all the work, you can get an A!!!  For the final paper, she guides you through it step by step!  I was really fearing this class and she totally exceeded my expectations. She is hot too which makes the class so much more enoyable!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2006<br>Class Name: SOC279<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Martha for Undergraduate stats and she was one of the nicest, most patient teachers I have had. Although her accent is heavy she goes out of her way to make sure everyone understands her. She helped me understand the material, and that's the most important point.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/07/2006<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>MaRtha is a fantastic teacher! I recommend her to anyone! She has an accent, but it is NOT thick (like a previous post mentioned). She made herself extremely available to students. The material is boring but she makes it exciting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/19/2006<br>Class Name: SOC402<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has a VERY heavy accent that made it difficult to follow...especially for a graduate stats course.  She sometimes switched to speaking Spanish mid-lecture, but she was really really easy to talk to and she gives you the grade you need, not the one you deserve.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2006<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Okay, the reading SUCKS, but you don't even really have to do it. Take ood notes and ask her questions. Two tests, a discussion, and a 12 paged paper. Make sure to confirm with her what will be on the exams, and how much info you will need on you papers</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2005<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>really nice and helpful. made a class with very boring material pretty interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2005<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was a great teacher for this entry-level class.  She was very inteligent and a great teacher.  SHe seemed that she had a lot of experience even though she is young and just out of school.  I'd take her again if I had to.  Highly recom..   She is also very nice and willing to help.  Very interesting perspectives.  SHe knows a lot about China.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2005<br>Class Name: SOC402<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice, is available for outside of class help.
