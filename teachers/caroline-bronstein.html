She is helpful if you need clarification, projects are at least fun.  I was put off by her admiration of Lena Dunham, and her apparent defense of the questionable hobbies.  Her jokes are off-putting, at least to a more conservative student, but overall decent prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2015<br>Class Name: MCS354<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Bronstein is truly the BEST professor I have had throughout my time at DePaul. She provides the most thorough feedback on essays, always presents the most current data, and completely understands media use in teens today! She is always available to help and goes out of her way to make sure you understand! Absolutely amazing professor! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2015<br>Class Name: MCS354<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>I LOVEEE this professor! She is incredibly nice, honest, always prepared for class and always willing to lend some extra help if you don't understand something. This is my second class with her and I wish I could have her teach every course of mine. You'll have to work for a good grade but the paper topics are even pretty interesting. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2013<br>Class Name: PRAD335<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Love her! Great, kind, funny, and passionate about advertising. She really opened my eyes to a lot of different things. Assignments weren't too hard and were fun and worth the time put into it. She leads a very laid back environment where its easy and interesting to learn and bounce ideas off the class. Highly recommended class and teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD335<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took her online PRAD 335 class and loved it. She can be really picky in grading the ad analyses, but not in a mean-spirited way by any means. My grades on them only got better once I figured out what she wanted. She is so sweet, helpful, and constructive. I would totally take a class with her again if I wasn't graduating! Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2012<br>Class Name: MCS354<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Bronstein is an amazing woman and tries really hard to teach you as much information as she can in a short amount of time. Papers were challenging to write but she is very clear about what she wants from you. She's very understanding if you have issues. Pretty big group presentation sucks. Overall great class -- HIGHLY recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2011<br>Class Name: PRAD335<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is amazing! Her powerpoints are clear and she is super engaging. She is a bit picky on the ad analysis but offers a lot of help and commentary for the final paper. I would definitely take her again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2011<br>Class Name: PRAD301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's the best!

Took more than one of her grad level courses. Not because I thought they would be easy or that scoring an A would be a sure thing. Simply because I enjoy her classes so much.
