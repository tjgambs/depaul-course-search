He knows his stuff, but sometimes it's hard for him to communicate the knowledge to you.  Be sure to ask questions if you are unsure or else he'll assume you understand.  Funny, awkward, and smart man.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2009<br>Class Name: MUS320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love paul failla!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2008<br>Class Name: MUS211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgeable, great guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/22/2008<br>Class Name: MUS110<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He seemed like a nice guy. Had a difficult time explaining material and got ahead of himself. Many students did not understand him. He expected you to find a tutor if you didn't understand it. Lots of busy work and &quot;drills&quot; in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/14/2007<br>Class Name: M101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>excellent</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2006<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was my first class that I took at DePaul and it was good to have a nice friendly teacher. I think it was actually his first time teaching there too. He was young, and nervous, but a good teacher over all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2006<br>Class Name: COMP<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have him for a night composition class and it is great!  He lets us write what we wish to write and he gives great feed back!  He is a great composer himself!:-) All smiles</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok so I don't think its so easy. There is a lot to memorize and its all so incredibly boring its hard to get yourself to memorize so much pointless information. He's alright, but he definatelyd does think every composer is the greatest composer ever. This class as a night class is the longest 3 hours ever. Don't do it to yourself. Just don't.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2005<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i sit in his class every week and want to die because it is so terribly boring. he's taken a subject which should be fun-MUSIC-and turned it into work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2005<br>Class Name: MUSIC100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy class but very very booorrrinnnggggg...

I wouldn't recommend anyone taking him but if you do go to his class/dont be late cause he will get an attitude. Don't expect extra credit. Midterm/final/reports.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2005<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>VERY EASY, BUT BOOORRRRINNNG CLASS!!!! 3 CONCERT REPORTS, MIDTERM AND FINALE.
