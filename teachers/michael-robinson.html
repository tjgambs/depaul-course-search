He keeps the lectures as interesting as possible (which is hard in accting) with anecdotes from his experience prior to teaching. He teaches straight from the book, which isn't ideal, but like any class, it is crucial to keep up with the material. The exams were somewhat difficult, but he grades them very fairly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2012<br>Class Name: ACCT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Robinson was awesome. Finally a professor below 50 who is funny and smart and gets what its like trying to understand this stuff for the first time. He went out of his way to make sure everyone participated and understood the material. Average grade on the exam was 90%! Great guy, great class. Good work DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2012<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Robinson definitely knows his stuff when it comes to Financial Accounting.  I thought this class would revolve more around understanding and interpreting financial statements, not around creating them.  The tests examine your accounting skills, not your ability to read/interpret financial statements.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2012<br>Class Name: ACCOU1<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My friend and me saw the comments below and were shocked. It shows that a the quality of a professor is different for different people. I thought he was great. And I think its strange that someone said there was no homework. There was no graded homework, but there was plenty of work in the chapters assigned. Great professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2012<br>Class Name: ACCT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not sure what the other reviewers wanted from an accounting class. He set clear reading assignments, had clear expectations, and was logical. There was homework every week, he always responded to my emails, and made time to see me after class. I thought he was funny and nice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2012<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid him!!!He's just terrible prof!His lectures are by the book only,he doesn't answer you questions clearly and doesn't respond to e-mails.His final and midterm are completely different from what he says,some questions are just unsolvable.Tough grader and doesn't seem like knowing accounting himself!The worst prof I had so far!Don't take him!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2012<br>Class Name: ACCT500<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Of all the classes that I have taken at DePaul, both undergrad and graduate levels, this was by far the worst and hardest. He assigns no HW. No classwork. 25% of grade on the midterm and 75% of grade from the final. No study guides were given and the exams were closed book, closed notes. He seems like a nice guy, but not a good educator in my opin.</div></div></div></body></html>
