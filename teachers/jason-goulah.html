Jason embodies the mission of DePaul as a school focused on urban education and advancement of education for those at the margins.  Quite simply an inspiration to us all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2014<br>Class Name: BBE326<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>He does a good job trying to engage students in the class and will crack silly jokes from time to time.  He's a smart guy and sometimes condescending to students.  I hate the way he doesn't really answer questions (he'll respond with "it was in the article we read" or "we talked about it three weeks ago"). Sorry I don't have a photographic memory!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/21/2012<br>Class Name: CS101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Goulah is terrific! By far one of the best teachers at DePaul. He is enthusiastic, knowledgeable, interesting and passionate about his topics. He does a great job moderating dialogue in the classroom setting. I would take his class again any time.</div></div></div></body></html>
