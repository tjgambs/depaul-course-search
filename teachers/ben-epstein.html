Such a cool, hip guy who understands what it means to be a student. His media and politics class is one of the best, if not the best, poli sci class at DePaul. The research project was a bit tedious. You must write on a blog each week as a class requirement. Readings are shorter than what most poli sci classes assign. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2015<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors I have had at DePaul!
