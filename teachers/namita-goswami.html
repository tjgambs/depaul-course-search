She is by far one of the BEST professors at depaul.  She is extremely helpful and very into her topics. I can not wait to have another class with her! She is very understanding, straight forward and interested in her students lives--which is rare to find in some professors.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2009<br>Class Name: PHL394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was my fave prof at DePaul.

(That comment from 4/12/09 that says &quot;this woman&quot; is just rude-and wrong.) She has been incredibly helpful for understanding the concepts of philosophy. She brings great energy and love for philosophy to her teaching. She gets students to really think and express themselves. Take her classes-you will see!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2009<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is now my favorite professor at DePaul!  She is a great teacher and really makes you think.  Don't be afraid to take her philosophy class about death.  It can be very heavy at times but its well worth it.  She is absolutly wonderful</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2009<br>Class Name: PHL394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very friendly and sweet teacher. A lot of the topics are broad but she is a great help and narrows things down if u need it. For example, if u need help on an essay or anything. Overall awesome, take this class u wont regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2008<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interesting professor. she helped all the students and even let you rewrite papers. great way to be introduced into philosophy, she makes it interesting and doesn't make you read all those boring classics but uses contemporary accounts</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2008<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WOW! Make sure you do your readings because she knows if don't read and she also takes note if you don't have the readings with you.She &quot;tears&quot; apart papers BUT will help you with the revisions.

As you go on you see shes really sweet. Attendance required or your grade suffers. Going to class is a must to understand concepts and notes. very helpful reviews before papers and she allows as many rewrites as needed to get an A! She waved the final as well, this is rare tho. amazing prof great class not easy A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2008<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She can be really intimidating at first but as class goes on you realize she's pretty funny and just wants everyone to learn what she's teaching and do well.

However a big problem is that she did not want what I thought about a particular subject but rather only wanted to hear her own opinion especially on papers. On a first draft of mine she wrote what she wanted which went against the paper assignment where the students come up with their own conclusions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor!

If you participate and write some good papers you are guarenteed an A.  Makes a boring class interesting she is great. She is interesting, you learn a lot, and its an easy A.

She's fun and really a pretty brilliant person. &quot;You have to let it make you weep before you  can analyze&quot; to misquote her. just mind bending theory throught someone who knows hegal like the back of her hand. cool.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2005<br>Class Name: PHILOSOPHY100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>EASIEST EVER.
