She rushed things a lot this quarter and gets frustrated with you when you do not understand what she is telling you. After basically the whole class started complaining that she was rushing with lessons she slowed down a little.Hated her at first but grew to like her. You better prepare yourself for a challenge!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2008<br>Class Name: ARB101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Samar is a wonderful teacher and very helpful (especially for those who have no previous Arabic experience). She expects a lot from her students, and her style of teaching (while difficult) is the best way to learn a language. Loves to talk about Syria, and has GREAT style! Beautiful, intelligent teacher! Take her if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2008<br>Class Name: ARABC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is an awesome teacher i would definitely recommend her to anyone who is even slightly interested in taking arabic. She is extremely helpful she stays with u as long as u want just so u can understand the subject. Her homeworks are easy and before u turn the homework in ask her if u got the right answers or not. she is hot, easy with the easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2008<br>Class Name: ARB101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Samar, though out right now on maternity leave, is a wonderful teacher.  Sometimes, she doesn't quite know how to explain the english translation or usage for arabic, but if you listen hard..you'll get it.  Plus, SHE'S HOT!!!!</div></div></div></body></html>
