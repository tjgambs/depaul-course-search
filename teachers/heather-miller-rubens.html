She doesn't just answer the questions for you, she enjoys class participation.  For this class we had materials from D2L, and a thin reading on Locke. We mostly focused on court cases pertaining to religion (Europe/US)that you will print. There are a few papers. She is great! I would take her again!</div></div></div></body></html>
