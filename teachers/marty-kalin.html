He Knows His Stuff. He is very clear about all concepts. Lectures feel long. Kind grader if you show some comprehension. HARD material if you can't learn: C, Intel Assembly, Hardware Architecture. One 4 question hwk due weekly at midnight. Optional midterm. One makeup hwk. If you fall behind, good luck!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2011<br>Class Name: CS373<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Learned a lot.
