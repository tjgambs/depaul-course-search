This class is very hard as it is and he does it half online half in class. I need to be in class to learn and understand. He just posts the slides online and READS them. I think I am intelligent enough do read them myself. Very confusing. He knows a lot but one of those people that don't know how to teach.Avoid!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2012<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took him for corp tax. Avoid at all costs. Idk how he is allowed to teach. He doesnt care abt if the students learn only cares if he understands what he is teaching. Out of the 11 people i talked to in class all failed his midterm and he didnt really care. u will end up teaching yourself & he covers more material than all my other classes combined.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/28/2011<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He made everyone even more confusing, by giving useless lecture where he just reads out bunch of numbers.  Not very clear on what he's saying, rarely writes anything for students. Huge curve because no one gets what he's doing. I can tell he prepares 10 minutes for his lecture. Textbook is no use since he emphasizes things not on the textbook</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2010<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You will live, breathe, and give up all weekends for this class. By the end you will be CPA ready and is completely worth taking! He is helpful during office hours. He cares about his students and teaches what you need to know... study hard!!! I would take him for every class I could!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2010<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard course, great teacher. I wouldn't recommend him if you want an easy A. But, hey, its accounting! Attendance is mandatory. Miss one class, and you are in the dark. His manual helps, book is detailed and complicated. Midterm, final, 2 tax problems, lots of easy quizzes. I'd definitely take another course with him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2009<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Athletic personality for old guy. You realize that he has no intention of intimidating anyone. Teaches like a cpa review class putting in little effort and leaves you to study the hard work balance on your side. Since he goes at a fast pace usually we cant think of questions long after the lecture but makes up for it with a gigantic curve.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/21/2009<br>Class Name: ACCT383<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tax is hard, but you'll learn alot if you just put in the effort.

He gives out a lot of take home quizzes, 2 tax return problems near the end of the quarter, and one easy excercise handout. Make sure you do well on them because those points really matter! The midterm & final were very hard -All MC but the curve was HUGE and get his study manual!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2009<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is one of those classes that you give up your weekends studying for!

Foth was a great prof and made tax about as enjoyable as he could for a 5 week crash course over the summer quarter.  Work hard, you'll do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2008<br>Class Name: ACCT560<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is extremely difficult to understand in class. Usually, I'm so lost, I don't even know what questions to ask. My advice, do the homework problems so you'll understand a little of what he's talking about in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/30/2007<br>Class Name: ACCT560<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>foth as a professor is ok - nice guy, tries to be a bit funny, curves the grade. the topic itself it extremely difficult, detail orientated and really freaking sucks. oh, and it will take over your life for 10 weeks. if you aren't prepared to give up every weekend of the semester to study, you can't expect a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2007<br>Class Name: ACC560<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>condescending and unwilling to answer questions posed by students. he makes me feel like i have to teach myself everything</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/01/2007<br>Class Name: ACC551<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is very challenging.  I got an A and used the suggested texts to take practice exams.  Really only need class notes that he hands out.   Went to office hours once and was not very friendly. in class he is pretty funny.  Overall a good class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2006<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was very hard!  He went through the material way too fast and never gave students a chance to ask questions.  His jokes are rude and he has no idea how to teach hard material!  Avoid!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2006<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Given its a tax class, you should expect it to be hard.  He's not all about throwing the material at you, but he'll try at times to go into some detail as to why tax laws are the way they are.  He has a sense of humor that can come off as rude to those on the receiving end, but come on, be a sport about it.  I hope to destroy him in golf one day.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2006<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard class!  I studied a ton and this was my first B ever.  I was upset, but got over it - considering this class is impossible.  After tax with Foth, I decided to major in finance and avoid accounting at all costs.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2006<br>Class Name: ACC360<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very hard and rude. likes to jeer students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2006<br>Class Name: TAX798<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor!  Anyone interested in tax must take his classes.  You work hard, but you learn a lot.

He makes it easy with the handouts, and quizzes mostly come off of them. He will explain and go over things if necessary.

Teacher was helpful with handouts. Really study the handouts and do and understand the example problems they will help you a lot. Material can get very confusing.
