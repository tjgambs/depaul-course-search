Her business ethics class was interesting and challenging at times. The textbook is a bit difficult, but she goes over it in class and makes everything really clear. The last 3+ weeks of the course are spent doing/watching group presentations. Not too labor intensive.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/17/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Goes way deep into the books. u have to follow as she talks b/c shes very deliberite about using words from the books and making u learn about their context and stuff.

Her assignments did not make any sense. The books were a ridiculous waste of time. She's just a BORING teacher, who needs to learn how to teach and connect with her students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/01/2007<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I absolutly loved this prof. Although she requires a lot of reading, she goes over everything significant in class. If you pay attention in class, you will recieve an easy A. Participate a lot!! She loves students who ask questions and comment on the readings. There are 4 quizzes and two 4pg papers, and a final paper.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2006<br>Class Name: PHL235<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She will make you learn how to write.

She's very confusing and the material was not explained clearly. I would take this class again, but with a professor that makes the material easier to understand, because I was confused throughout the whole quarter with this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2005<br>Class Name: PHL235<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent prof.Class is tough, but if you pay attention,do the reading,and show up to class you will do fine.

Professor Sturdevant is so intelligent and intriguing. Class was a little boring and the presentations once a week were no help, but she explained difficult readings well.
