He was always nice, and very helpful to the class. He aslso seemed to care about our interpretations of the plays we read. I would take class again with him in a heart beat.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2011<br>Class Name: THE242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is fantastic! He brings a lot of personal experience to the table, and makes class interesting. Very small class size makes it even better. He challenges you to think about the text you are discussing, and he is great about engaging classmates! I would highly recommend him any day.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2010<br>Class Name: THE290<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class consisted of seeing 2 plays and writing a 4 pg response paper for both. Attendance was mandatory. No midterm and the final was the performance of a scene. EASYYYY CLASS!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2009<br>Class Name: PRF290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far best class I have taken at Depaul.Interesting class. Also alot of fun.actingExercises,stretchingyou have to watch two plays and write a 4 page paper on them,not bad at all final is an acting skit,as long as you put in effort should be a easy A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2008<br>Class Name: THE242<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class= pretty easy. There were a couple of analysis, you have to visit a 2 plays,write response papers and pay for them yourselves, which sucks if you are a broke college student. He is to much into himself.If you watch a play and like it and write about it, and he didn't like it don't expect to get an A. Stuck in his acting years,he's always right</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2007<br>Class Name: PRF101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy A. Two written responses to two plays, and a performance final. He is supposed to have mandatory attendance, but it seemed like it had no affect on my grade. Take it if your looking for easy A arts and lit requirement.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2007<br>Class Name: THE242<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You most likely end up getting an A, but all semester he'll load you with papers to write. Have to come to class, he is pretty easy towards the end of the term. I'd recommend but not an easy class (there was a guy in my class who took him before and said that he used to be much easier and less picky on grading).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2007<br>Class Name: THE242<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Well, he's ok, but there is a lot of writting and you can't get a full grade on the 1st 2 papers. I wouldn't say he is EASY EASY like in all other reviews, but you can manage to get an A if you really put your time into all the assignments/papers. Also, he is super boring and makes the dumbest jokes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2007<br>Class Name: THE232<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>4 play to read and review+2 play to watch and review&quot;+final project and presentation. He changed his teaching tech from 2 terms ago, too much work+no one ever gets a full grade because he says that no one is EVER good enough. Very hard and too much work for a AL. Also, he is no longer that pleasant, quite the opposite, he changed A LOT!! Stay Away!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2006<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor!!

All you do is act a scene out a see 2 plays. best art&lit you can take. easy easy easy A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2005<br>Class Name: WORLDOTHEATRE<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably the most relaxed and laid back teacher at Depaul. Take him if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2005<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No homework except for papers on plays.  You read 3 in class and have to see 2 on your own time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2005<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you aren't interested in theater, just looking for the easy A, you will get it but it will be a very long quarter. Class is VERY boring if you don't like theater. There is NO midterm or final for his class. Only grades are 2 papers for plays you go see in person and 3 papers based on plays you read in class. He is pretty nice/funny though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2005<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a great professor and its a really interesting class that you will get something from when you're done. take him, he's great and is very flexible. cancels class on crummy days and is an easy grader</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2005<br>Class Name: PRF290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOME PROFESSOR!  The work required doesn't feel like work, plus it's easy.  He wants you to get something from the experience, be open to it and you'll walk away with a great appreciation for acting, directing, and writing.  I wish I could have had him for every class I had to take.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/24/2005<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely take this class or anything else Lou teaches!  He is by far one of the best professors at DePaul.  Treats you like an adult and grades fairly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2005<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Funny, Laid-back, Interesting, Energetic, Knowledgeable and Easy!
