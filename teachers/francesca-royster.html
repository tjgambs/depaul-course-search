She seems genuine and truly connected to what she does as a scholar. Be ready to participate in class discussions. Be ready to read. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2012<br>Class Name: ENG286<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had her for Graphic Novels and Social Justice. She's a very nice woman and tries to make connections to the books and real life. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. She cares, and that's something to commend her on though. It was he first time teaching the class so I'd cut her slack.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2012<br>Class Name: ENG286<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her for Graphic Novels and Social Justice. The reading list was very fun and interesting, but she she taught very poorly. She was very nice and understandable, but it seemed like she almost had nothing to say on the subject. I learned NOTHING in the class that I wouldn't have learned from just reading the books on their own. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2010<br>Class Name: ENG328<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her Shakespeare class is really enjoyable. She really enjoys class participation, which can be a bit difficult when you're not really sure about the play. Accepts all ideas and opinions. You read 4 plays and write comparisons about the play and movie versions. When this is not due you write weekly questions with a short answer. Some pop quizzes.

Good variety in teaching to keep the class interesting, and makes you think about a lot of relevant topics.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/29/2009<br>Class Name: ENG328<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. Dr. Royster supported student participation and comment without passively agreeing to what they said. She would reflect and respond: if somebody said something vapid, she supplemented the comment with intelligent commentary. She gave helpful feedback on all assignments, does some unusual class activities. I really liked this class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2009<br>Class Name: ENG328<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really enjoyed her Shakespeare class. She does focus on larger cultural issues, as some one else said, but isn't that kind of the point&#63; I don't know, I thought it was very interesting and well worth my time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2008<br>Class Name: ENG328<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgeable. Relies a LOT on supplementary material that is mostly irrelevant. Do not expect to really dissect Shakespeare. She is much more interested in culture and larger implications. I was really disappointed. Lectures extremely boring. Participation is mandatory. Quiz every week.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2006<br>Class Name: ENG328<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely nice professor.  She brings energy to the classroom!  She is too compliant however with students' opinions.  I wish she would have outright said, &quot;no. this is how it is.&quot;  Her theoretical comments were interesting, but she never gave any fact-based comments, or really discussed Shakespeare himself...and I would have enjoyed that.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2006<br>Class Name: ENG428<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really enjoyed the her Shakespeare grad. seminar.  It was a good class.  There is a lot of reading, but she is a fair teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2006<br>Class Name: ENG474<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an incredibly learned individual whose scholarly accomplishments were astonishing. Every single on of my research articles mentioned her contributions to the field of Shakespeare appropriations of race and sexuality. Great class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: ENGLISH320<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is indeed a very nice lady but she isn't a teacher and could not be any more boring.  Take a handful of speed before coming to this class to keep you awake.  (Other than that do the reading and it's an easy grade.)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2005<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Didn't change my life or make me a better writer or anything.

Easy grade, lenient</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2004<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is helpful and her class is easy, and she is an easy grader. But I do not like her I had a bad experience with her personally, I do not think she is a nice lady. Definetly favors students. Easy A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2004<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy going class although required a lot of reading (1 book a week & articles) She's very interested in the topics she teaches and loves to hear her students ideas! Discussion are her main thing... pretty easy grader if she sees you trying! VERY nice prof</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2004<br>Class Name: ENG328<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice and very cool lady! She taught Shakespeare from a feminist viewpoint, with an african-american studies emphasis, which was a different but enlightening approach. Very smart, and not a hard grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2004<br>Class Name: CAPSTONE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a wonderful woman/person/teacher. Her readings are many and varied, and often very academic, but her emphasis is on discussion. Be prepared to sit in a circle and talk! Really smart and helpful, her classes are all good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2004<br>Class Name: CAPSTONE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As a person, I really like her, even though I disagree with some of her beliefs. Her teaching style is a little loose, but informal insofar that it is a refreshing alternative to the droll lectures most teachers inflict upon students. Easy grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2003<br>Class Name: ENG328<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought Prof. Royster was very knowledgeable about the course subject matter and communicated her own enthusiasm for the work. Sometimes she seems like she is a little hesitant to take control of the class. She assigned really cool, challenging readings</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2003<br>Class Name: CMN275<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She creaps me out and annoys me!  She made me go all the way to the Damon stop to get a book and I got harassed by some creepy dude.  She talks as though she is unsure of what she wants to say.  She needs to be more outgoing in order to be likeable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2002<br>Class Name: WMS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>challenging, empathetic, sweet, intellectually curious, black feminisms course.</div></div></div></body></html>
