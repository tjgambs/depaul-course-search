Her assignments were so vague that when you turned them in, requirements that she never mentioned weren't met.  When asked for a rubric or guideline she promised and never delivered, don't take the risk....</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2005<br>Class Name: HST348<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. brought in for a guest lecture; was extremely unprofessional and unhelpful. Stream of consciousness lecture on the Holocaust (the assigned topic). Spent 2 1/2 hours on random bits of history and 15 minutes on the Holocaust.

Very easy. Dont expect to learn anything though. Hardest thing was a 5 page paper about Titanic, and that was really easy. Take this class if you want to just get a credit and not learn anything, except that you dont date royalty.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2004<br>Class Name: HST218<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ok BLOW OFF...didnt buy the book..A+..midterm was a trial...one paper asking you to explain why the Titanic sank...and the final was cook a food and explain the history of it...CAN IT GET ANY EASIER...showed up to class 60% of the time...Extremely nice lady though...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2004<br>Class Name: HIS218<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was such a nice lady. She is extremely helpful and understanding. The class is easy, but boring. We had to read the book Timeline, and surprisingly, it was really good. I still own it, but don't base the book on the movie, because the movie sucked.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2004<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is awesome and she is VERY intelligent! I would recomend taking her.

I think almost everyone got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2004<br>Class Name: HIS218<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy, easy, easy! The class didn't even feel like a history class at all! No tests, only a midterm group project, final group project, and a paper on a book.  If you get the chance, definitely take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2004<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2004<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very very intelligent and nice!

Our mid-term and final didn't even consist of anything from the material (IT WAS SO EASY).  So gave the whole class an A on the mid-term and (I think) final.  The funny thing is it really didn't feel like history class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2004<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2004<br>Class Name: HISTORY21<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>&quot;I GOT An A&quot; easiest teacher ever, i never bought the book, i showed up hardly, and for finals i typed a paper on a book called Timeline that i never even read, ohh yeah i took in a pie from Dominicks for the other half of my finals grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2004<br>Class Name: HST218<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's nice, and you can tell that she's smart, but something's not right up there.

However, she doesnt challenge the class. The midterm was an oral discussion that included the entire class so if you spoke up you pretty much got an A. The final was a 10 page paper on Michael Creighton's Timeline Good Book Wierd Paper</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2003<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is so random when teaching, and she turned a class about the Cubs into a class about her, even putting an essay question on the final about herself. Didn't learn anything, class just took up time. No homework, pretty easy. Craziest teacher out there!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2003<br>Class Name: HST<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved her as a teacher. She is slightly unorganized true, but she is one of the most brillant people that I have ever met in my entire life, she is like a human encyclopedia of history. She is with grades, she will let you retake tests and write papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/30/2003<br>Class Name: HISTORY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she was very scatterbrainned and a little out there and her class was boring, but i really liked her and she was sooo easy!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2003<br>Class Name: HST218<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is funny, but class is xtremely boring</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2003<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>a nice woman but class was disorganized and unchallenging</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2003<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was a class about baseball, and she turned it into a class about herself.
