He grades on completion so what you make doesn't need to be perfect. The quizzes are difficult. You'll need to study for them</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2015<br>Class Name: CSC406<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very clear teacher, but I felt like the material was covered too fast. More guidance on studying for his tests would have been appreciated.   I had no idea how to study for his exams because they were extremely short and normally contained trick questions.  It's a hard subject though, I would probably choose him over other teachers again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2015<br>Class Name: CSC241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ljubomir knows what's up, he wrote the textbook and he is the best one to teach this class. His lectures are very clear and he makes sure to take his time. While intimidating at first, if you ever need him to slow down or re-explain something he is super willing to do that. Loved this guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2015<br>Class Name: CSC406<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Perkovic is brilliant. He knows exactly what material he needs to present, in the exact fashion, and at the right pace. Systems is a very abstract course for most, and Dr. Perkovic realizes that, so he is very patient and accommodating with students. His expectations are clear cut, so the labs and midterm are fair. The final is a bit trickier.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2014<br>Class Name: CSC373<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: C</div><div id="right"><div>Took this course online which is basically the same as taking it in class, but you get to watch the lectures from home. There are 5 easy homework assignments and 3 challenging labs which are just long homework assignments. The midterm and final were both short (only 3 or 4 questions) so they were easy to fail if you messed up one question.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2014<br>Class Name: CSC406<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher.  Class was the hardest I ever had, but manageable if you really dedicate yourself.  Labs and homework were both pretty challenging and forced you to learn a lot. 1 complaint I have is on exams there was usually a question (for a large % of your grade) that was not similar to the HW or lab.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2014<br>Class Name: CSC242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. wrote the textbook you use in class. Class is not mandatory and is recorded. You have a lab day that is mandatory attendance. You get one homework assignment per week and you spend lab time working on it. There is no lab assignment. Teacher is very knowledgeable, really great guy, and super helpful. I highly recommend taking this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2014<br>Class Name: CSC406<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very direct and content-rich lectures. He moves at a quick pace but pauses often to ensure everyone is with him. The labs are very challenging but entertaining and is where you learn most of the content. The midterm was easy, the final more difficult than the midterm. If you put an honest effort into the labs you'll do well in the class overall.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2013<br>Class Name: CSC373<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very straight-forward professor.  Actually felt like I learned the material decently well which is a nice change of pace from other CS professors here.  Difficult grader but knows his stuff and will give detailed explanations.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: CSC406<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>He is a good professor . He knows the stuff , and his labs might be stressful but for your own good . I will definitely look for another class with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2013<br>Class Name: CSC406<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do your homework and don't cheat on the labs. If you pay attention, you'll do just fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2013<br>Class Name: CSC407<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you do the work, you will do just fine. His labs are really tough, but you will learn a ton, and he doesn't grade them too harshly because he know's they're hard. Exams are very fair and straightforward, no tricks. I would take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2013<br>Class Name: CSC383<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall a good professor. He's not a very good speaker, and it can be hard to understand what he's saying, but he's very knowledgeable about the content. A good professor if you're not going to need a lot of help outside of class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2010<br>Class Name: CSC241<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible cs teacher if you've never had cs before. Not too hard to understand. Not willing to meet outside of office hours. Responds to emails quickly. Homeworks are very easy. Youll get the grade you deserve if you know the material. book is useless though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2010<br>Class Name: CSC242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>VERY nice man and always willing to help. the class is hard though. not that you're expecting anything else from a cs class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2010<br>Class Name: CSC242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ljubomir is awesome! Highly recommend him. He can be challenging but is an awesome teacher that goes out of his way to help his students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/22/2009<br>Class Name: CSC241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Highly recommend Great prof</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2009<br>Class Name: CSC374<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher.  While every teacher has their own style and not everyone may get along, I think he is one of those who does a great job at pleasing the most people.  He was always available and explained things clearly.  He also pushed you to learn and do well without overwhelming you with work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2008<br>Class Name: CSC241<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>wow wow you are my favorite man ever</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2008<br>Class Name: CSC383<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher! I've only had him once and he is also my adviser. Great help, I didn't need it much but I noticed that he was always helping other students and even left the latter part of the last class to answer any questions for the final. I would definitely take a class from him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2008<br>Class Name: CSC374<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't understand the negative comments either. Yes, the material was difficult, but he clearly explained everything. He was willing to look over coding assignments and offer suggestions. He was always available for questions during office hours, email, phone. I wasn't very interested in the class material, but I thoroughly enjoyed the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2007<br>Class Name: CSC383<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm shocked that he has gotten these reviews.  I've taken him for three courses now and he is great.  If you don't understand the material, of course the class will be difficult. If computer science were easy everyone would take it. He is constantly helping students.  Don't take him if you don't want to. Then his class will be open to me</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2007<br>Class Name: CSC383<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is not too clear, and he assumed you know the course before take it, exercise are too hard and he does not complete to explain all the exercise he is explaining.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2007<br>Class Name: CSC374<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he really doesn't care if you understand the material or not. he just tells you to look in the book, but the book sux. he may know his stuff, but he needs to teach it better.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2006<br>Class Name: CSC374<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take this professor if you need answers to questions. It took him over a week to respond to an email. His curriculum was based on students more advanced than myself(a CS Senior) as the majority of the class had work experience in the field. Tests did not reflect class work, discussions or homework. You have to be an amazing at the C language</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/28/2005<br>Class Name: CSC383<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I read the other comments and after taking this guy's class I thought they were a bit off mark. The guy is clear.   You just gotta listen and think... He believes the students are intelligent enough to connect the dots. Very helpful, that's for sure.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2005<br>Class Name: CSC373<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't think this teacher was great. He was unorganized and sometimes unclear. The book for this class isn't that much help either. However, this prof knows his stuff, and he wants you to know your stuff. He is tough, and his homework is challenging, but you'll walk away from his class a much smarter person.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2005<br>Class Name: CSC383<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He really wants you learn. He'll go through the material but he's not very organized. Often times he gave us code that didn't work. He is hard to follow and doesn't express himself welll. But he will help you and I truly think he wants you to learn. Just not good at expression.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2005<br>Class Name: CSC373<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor!
