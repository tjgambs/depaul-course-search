Records voice memos of his impressions of your papers (no written feedback). We only had to write a few papers (4 I believe) of various lengths and types. His classes were always enjoyable and he's a great storyteller--you'll walk away from classes not even realizing how much he tricked you into learning. Textbook is The New York Times.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2015<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Nathan is AWESOME! He is probably my favorite professor I've had at DePaul so far. He's a really easy grader and he uses the New York Times for class assignmentpapers instead of a textbook. He also gives voice recording for feedback  and emails you a day before class on what the homeworkreading is. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TAKING HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2015<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fink was phenomenal, out of all my other courses in the qtr, I looked forward to his class the most. The atmosphere is great--he's very laid back and the conversations are never boring, making it easy to participateshare your own ideas. Syllabus super straight forward, put in hard work and effort and you will get a nice grade! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/22/2015<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>One of my favorite classes I took this year - and it was required. He uses NYT for very class and assignments are very easydoable. He relates to the students in a way that will definitely make you laugh!! He helps you through your essays - sends you audio docs with feedback - so much better than written feedback! Awesome teacher & class overall!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/14/2015<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Best WRD teacher! He makes english fun to learn and is good looking too! All you need is the NYT, don't buy the St. Martins handbook because he goes over what's in it anyway. What's not to love?</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2014<br>Class Name: HON100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's amazing.

His stories are funny and insightful. He is honest and open with the students and is never boring. Really a great professor! I loved taking his class! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Coolest guy ever. It seems like he's been to every nook and cranny. His stories are super crazy you'd doubt they're true. His lectures are the best. You can resubmit anything if you get a bad grade, NYT readings are very thought provoking. Flexible deadlines, will give personalized audio feedback emailed to you after every major paper. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nathan is an amazing professor. He makes class fun and rather than reading out of an outdated textbook refers directly to the NY times. He is hilarious and tells us lots of stories from his life. He cares about his students and knew everyones name after a week which can't be said about all professors at DePaul. If you can take him, do! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BY FAR MY FAVORITE PROFESSOR AT DEPAUL. He is hysterical, he knows what he is talking about, he makes everything relevant, he forces you to come into office ours (which is beyond helpful), and he pushes you to do work on what interests you. The entire class is based on what you like to research and talk about. I cannot talk highly enough about him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professor I've ever had in DePaul.

Great teacher. Definitely someone you want to take a course with. Everything taught was interesting, fun, and applicable. Despite the less conventional teaching styles, the message came across more effectively because of it. Learnt tons. If you take him you won't regret it :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2013<br>Class Name: HON100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nathan is the best professor I've had thus far at DePaul. He is extremely helpful and your writing skills will improve tremendously. I STRONGLY recommend him for any class. Take him and you're ideas about writing will be completely changed.  Ps Textbook is the New York Times, which is too dope.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/24/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best professor I've had at DePaul. Hands down. He has an interesting story to go with everything he teaches. He gets to know each student. I've reached out to him several times after the class has ended to help with other assignments and he has gladly helped (Gladly met with me for an hour long interview needed for another class when I asked).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nathan is awesome.

Honestly, the best professor/teacher I've ever had. He helped me regain my interest in writing. Barely any textbook use and relies heavily on the NY Times. Take him!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely one of the best teachers I have had this quarter.

Super awesome!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easily one of my favorite professors I've had at DePaul. He finds creative ways to relate discussions/lessons to everyday life and he keeps things interesting and relevant. Very helpful. Great personality. I recommend him to everyone I know.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I honestly could not have asked for a better professor for WRD 103. His lesson plans are so well thought out and relevant to what we are learning, as are the video clips & pictures he shows, along with the stories he tells. We once had to use rhetoric to help him in an awkward situation. You will NOT regret taking him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I absolutely loved his class. He's so clear about what he expects and doesn't ask for over-the-top assignments that are incredibly time-consuming. He's also willing to go out of his way to help you if you're having trouble. Oh, and he's very, very good-looking.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of my favorite teachers by far. He is motivated and helpful, and does the best he can to help his students succeed (especially with his commentary on rough drafts). Great all around teacher, I highly recommend Prof. Fink.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/05/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was 3 hrs long on a Friday morning which sucked since I live off campus. Even w/that he is a great guy. Explains everything clearly. Not a very demanding class. If you give at least minimal effort you will be fine. Gives the best stories. Like how he proposed to his gf or about her ugly dress. Sometimes brings coffee to class for everyone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/30/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor I've ever had. Super young and fun, but clearly knows what he's talking about. Tells hilarious stories, and genuinely cares about how you do in the class and understand the material.

Pretty cute too!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's an excellent professor;he teaches the concepts really well and integrates personal stories relevant to the material we learn in class. he demands short papers and also provides abundant helpful comments,so for those who don't want to write long research papers, he's the best professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2012<br>Class Name: HIST103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OMG.

Great teacher who can relate to all of us and always makes the lesson interesting with real life stories transitioning into the lesson. You learn a lot and he wants you to pass all of your essays with is helpful feedback. Don't worry Nathan. I doubt anyone will give you a bad review. Anyone who does is crazy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's awesome and super funny!
