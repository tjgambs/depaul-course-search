He's a very lenient teacher. Almost all questions on the midterm and final are given beforehand. But. Call me a nerd, I don't feel like I learned much from that class. Practically no discussion and it's a ethics/religion course. Books. you can get the 6th edition of the Shaw book. works perfect. Use ISHARE!didn't have to buy anything</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2011<br>Class Name: REL262<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easiest prof. ever. One research paper and 2 exams. For the exams everything you need to know is on the PowerPoint. He also gives the sources you need for the research paper. Just try to participate in class because your participations points can suffer in the end. Take him if you want an easy &quot;A&quot;.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2010<br>Class Name: RELMG228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fre is a very good teacher. Participation and attendance are important. There are 2 papers and 2 exams. If you listen to him carefully and go over the study guide for exams, the class will be pretty easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2010<br>Class Name: RELMG228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fre is a cool guy.  At first, I thought it was going to be a long semester, but got to appreciate him better.  His lectures are exactly from the reading, along with his power point slides.  Just pay attention, take good notes and you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2010<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took one class with this prof and I got an A. Go to the class and pay little bit of attention , you'll be fine. Im taking another class with him and Im excited !!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2010<br>Class Name: REL262<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Counts participation as 15% of your grade BUT he dislikes if you talk to ANYONE around you during class. Reading is around 100 pages for every class session, does short quizzes too! Midterm and final are tough. He grades out of 100 points for the quarter. I dosed off many times in his class. We watch a few films but not many.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2010<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's an unintentionally condescending holy roller. He likes to paint a portrait of secular people as irrational haters of religion. His tests are total mind control for his pro religion and carbon tax stances. His lectures are &quot;rain man&quot; like rambles, he will mark you down hard for participation, and he has an exaggerated sense of self importance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2010<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really recommend this professor! He is very helpful and you can tell he has a passion for what he is teaching. Easy A if you go to class and pay attention.  He pretty much tells you exactly what is on the midterm and final!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2010<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>May be hard to understand his terminology sometimes, but knows a lot. He brings a lot to the table.. Just attend class and keep up to date and you're sure to pass with AT LEAST a B. One of the most understanding and helpful teachers I have had at De Paul. Take this class if you are interested in participating and thinking (not for slackers).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2010<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The professor does have an accent, but he is very understandable.  Very nice guy, and it?s an easy A if you go to class, take notes, and participate.  2 Exams, 2 Reflection papers.  He practically gives you the answers to the exam.  I would recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/21/2010<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cannot understand a word the guy says in class. Insanely boring, bring something to do. Easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2009<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His lectures are crushingly boring.  I took this as my fun, thought-provoking class; it was abysmal.  &quot;Class discussions&quot; were limited to his occasional fishing for textbook recitations.  If you want to learn about philosophy avoid this class.  If you want to regurgitate HS Kant and Rawls for the easiest A of your life, this is the class for you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2009<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He has some fairly easy tests, but he's pretty difficult to understand.  He's pretty funny with his ridiculous analogies, but overalll he's pretty easy going and cool.  Just make sure you do the study guides because it is test, except the study guide is more difficult. Tests are multiple choice and short answer which you have to regurgitate answers</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2009<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took 2 classes with him. The reading was boring but the midterm and final were super easy. He gives a review prior to the exams. Attendance is mandatory. There were also several papers we had to write.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2008<br>Class Name: BIZETH<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's cool, nice, entertaining lectures...funny!!  a great guy all together...he gives you chances to pull up your grade becuz he wants every1 to pass...if u need to take business ethics like pretty much everyone...you should def take him...you will like him..trust me..easy grading and final/midterm if u study a lil bit</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2008<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DONT TAKE HIS CLASS!! This guy will drop your grade from an A to B if you miss a single class. Attendance is mandatory!!! No exceptions unless you are dying  and has a doctors note with you. He is hard to understand. His papers are really hard. He requires you to write four assignment papers and you will have no time to write these.Be warned</div></div></div></body></html>
