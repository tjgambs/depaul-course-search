The class itself is not too hard, but the only thing HE did was confuse me.  Just read the book and don't show up for class, because it's useless.

I didn't learn that much from his lectures. He is boring and talks in a quiet voice all the time. He gives minimum examples of how the economy works. He knows so much but can't get it across to students. His midterm is 40% and final 60%</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2005<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is sooooooo boring. I have probably gone to a total of 6 classes the whole quarter. He breaks down his class by doing 40% midterm and 60% final.  His test aren't too bad becuase he gives the answers to some questions before the test. All you have to do is read the book and you are fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2005<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>easy-going teacher.gives straightforward tests(gives hints about the questions)study from the book! boring subject but he can be kinda funny.

He curves tests.  take decent notes and read the book somewhat. If you want to get an A, skim over the book before class then read it again a before the tests.
