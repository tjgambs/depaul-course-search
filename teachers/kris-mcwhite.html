He is actually a really cool guy, but you need to study and pay attention. He is willing to help after class and during office hours. He responds quickly to e-mails. Compared to other Econ teachers at DePaul, Professor McWhite is a dream.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/13/2012<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I truly enjoyed him. I usually hate econ classes, but he made it more interesting and definitely was not extremely strict or over enthused.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/12/2012<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>On the first day of class he announced that he didn't care if we learned or passed because his paycheck would still come in. From there the class just got worse. He was often offensive and super unclear. He wasn't very willing to help if you had questions and his tests are insanely hard. I dreaded this class because of him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2012<br>Class Name: ECO335<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His classes are really unhelpful you don't learn much and his test aren't that easy and he grades them pretty hard. He is pretty understanding and will pass you if you talk to him early in the year, but that is a last resort if you fall behind. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2012<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kris is actually quite funny, and his humor keeps you engaged in the topic.  I don't think he is getting the credit he deserves for making hard information so digestable.  I think most people have a problem because he doesn't have easy tests. Regardless, the tests fall right in line with the homework and practice problems.  Take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2012<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is incredibly approachable, and in general just a nice, good person. The people who don't do well on his tests don't do the homework (which is free grade points and practice).BONUS POINTS: one of the problems on his first exam used elements from the show &quot;It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia&quot; as the basis for multi-part question.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2012<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All he does is mumble and talk about himself. I'd still tap that though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2011<br>Class Name: ECO101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>pretty good teacher, he is a little all over the place, but he knows what he is talking about..look over the practice problems, and power point slides before exams, they are a game changer. also, interesting sense of humor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2011<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His humor is disrespectful, and he spends most of the class making jokes rather than teaching. I suppose he is a fairly nice person, but he lacks organization and eloquence.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2011<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is ridiculous... unprepared every day for class. uses graphs and charts in powerpoint slides that he doesn't even know where got them from but will say &quot;I don't think this is in your textbook&quot; and then proceeds to speed through everything and act like it doesn't matter when all of it he skips, and then some is on the exam. horrible prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2011<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof McWhite's class was the most disorganized class I have ever taken - he never seemed fully prepared. Exam grades averaged around 60-70%, so he is obviously not testing on what he is lecturing in class. I also found some of his humor to be extremely disrespectful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2011<br>Class Name: ECON315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>People that complain about him probably either never showed up or never asked for help. While his tests are hard, he curves it pretty well and is very willing to help students. If you actually take the time to read the textbook and go over his powerpoints it will be reflected in your grade. I would recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2011<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Outside of him being funny, there is absolutely no up side to taking him. We have had 2 exams so far, avg. 1-70 2-64 (with Curve). He explains everything briefly and acts like o this stuff is easy and o this you should know or go over it yourself. Half is written and a lot of surprise questions. Like What happen on a certain date&#63; RUNNNN!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2011<br>Class Name: ECON555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prior to this course I had over a 3.8 GPA, but even with studying over 20 hours for each of the three, 3 hour long exams I barely passed this course.  This amount of studying is necessary if you want to pass due to the professor?s poor teaching style.  Averages on the first two exams were 62.3% and 63.3%.  The final?s average was 72%, which McWhite</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2011<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's true, he doesn't speak or write very clearly, but it's not a hard class if you pay attention and do the homework. He's an incredibly nice person and takes his work seriously. Have questions ready and go to his office, he'll explain everything you ask until you get it. He's not nearly as bad as everyone makes him out to be. I recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2011<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher, most of his exams were mathematical questions that are not covered in the book and god knows where he gets his questions.. worst teacher I was thinking about majoring in economics but he made me change my mind pretty quickly.. he zooms through problems and expects you to just know it. horrible</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2010<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You better have a GREAT understanding of the FED and economics!! Teacher is unclear and ineffective.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2010<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lectured a lot which is good. When asked to explain something said &quot;you should have learned this in GSB 420&quot; and didn't explain it. Test overly difficult and graded harshly. Average test score was in the 65% range. Needs to consider new profession. Avoid this prof if possible!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/20/2010<br>Class Name: ECON555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First mistake...taking this class in the summer. Second mistake...taking this class without checking this site first. Third mistake...not dropping the course after the first class.  He talked more about sports, his personal stance on unrelated topics & random political conjecture that had absolutely nothing to do with the course. Avoid!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2010<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teaches from His PowerPoints. He is rude if you miss even one class and ask for an explanation of a key concept. He curves everything because the class average was below a 72%. He does not explain anything in detail, he just shows the before& afters. He did explain things in detail in one class, after everyone bombed the test.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2010<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know why everyone is giving him such bad reviews.  Sure his exams are hard, but then he adds a HUGE curve.  Turn in the homework that takes 5 minutes and actually study for his two exams and you'll do great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2010<br>Class Name: ECON101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful Professor.  Challenges current liberal indoctrination that has taken over DePaul University.  If you want a Professor that challenges the way you, and society at large thinks, this is the Professor for you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2010<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A bad teacher, doesn't teach and mumbles a lot. He prepares his own slides which don't help on HW or tests - doesnt use outline for chs. Challenging tests. I had to read all ch.s to get an A. The curve is good, but you won't learn very much from him. You must be able to teach yourself to pass. If you sincerely want to learn, you'll be disappointed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2010<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The other ratings pretty much sum it up.  He mumbles, he is sarcastic, doesn't explain things well at all, and then talks about his hometown all the time.  Homework was very difficult and the book was little help.  Says he has office hours, but was rarely there.  Turned Econ 315 into a PhD level class because of his strange explanations.  Stay away</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2009<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>STAY. AWAY.  He's absolutely terrible at teaching. Not helpful. Talks too fast.  Criticizes you. Tests are impossible. Homework is ridiculous since you don't know what he wants you to do. Contradicts himself and his teachings. Ridiculous.  Stay. Away. Don't take him. Class average was a 65%.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2009<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do yourself a favor and avoid this guy, he does not know how to teach.  His test were literally impossible, the only good thing is the curve...and the only reason he needed one was bc everyone failed the exams!  I barely ended up with a B, and thats thanks to the curve.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2009<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He doesn't do his job and expect students to understand everything. I basically taught myself. The only good thing I can say is that he curves the grades. Without it, 75% of the class would not be able to pass it. Averages from exams were around 50-65%.I managed to pass  with an A but I studied hard, and curved saved me too. AVOID!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2009<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this class was so hard. midterm, final and quizzes were impossible. i think i met the avg score one time and almost all of the questions i had never heard about. don't even bother taking him. im lucky i passed this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2008<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This Teacher is a jag. Hard tests,midterms,quizzes,homework  .I learned more about Clemson than econ. You are better off watching mad money at home cuz you dont learn anything besides how dumb he actually is. Dr. yea ok, who gave him that title.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2008<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AVOID - What a disaster this guy was.  He doesn't do any work at all and pulls all of the questions from text books onto his mid-term and final.  He will teach you one thing and test you one something different.  The test questions are impossible and require memorization.  I learned nothing and almost failed at that!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2008<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His tests and quizzes are nearly impossible. I did better than the class average every time by 10-20 percent and I'm still struggling to get an -A. All the information IS in the book but you have to know it inside and out. If you want to pass then read the chapters and study the HW. Be ready to be baffled on the majority of the test questions.

Professor reads (mumbles) off of his powerpoint slides with endless references to Clemson & football. He makes jokes about his education and how easy it was to get a master's degree. There is so much material & you will be lucky if he explains any of it. Tests were impossible average always in the 60s. Have to teach yourself.AVOID</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2008<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this guy makes it just plain difficult to learn any of the material. he needs to go back to SC because depaul isnt working. the tests are so bad that the class overall average is at 70 and the averages for the tests are at 45. avoid avoid avoid!!</div></div></div></body></html>
