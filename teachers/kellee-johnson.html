She just isn't the best teacher, she always seems rushed and talks extremely fast. She always talks about herself and then the exam has tons multiple choice questions we never discussed in class. She she doesn't seem to care about students. I had to go out of my way, don't take her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2013<br>Class Name: PRAD255<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Johnson is a good teacher, very knowledgeable about the PR field.  She does talk relatively quickly and can be at times a hard grader.  You don't necessarily have to read and she makes you do weekly news assignments, but if you want to do well you have to study for the midterm and final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2013<br>Class Name: PRAD255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want specific guidelines on how to be successful in PR, this is your class. Great real life examples, from a professor who knows her stuff. I highly recommend it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2013<br>Class Name: PRAD255<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class and I learned a lot. She knows her stuff and always gives clear examples. The weekly assignments are easy and you can pick up quickly on what is expected. Tests have clear study guides for midterm & final. Final project at the end is cool too. Take her class! It was one of the best I had.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2013<br>Class Name: PRAD255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very engaging teacher which helps you pay attention. If she branches off topic it's PR related & gives you a real life example. She is extremely helpful and accessible. The test can be difficult but she gives extra credit opportunities to help .</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2013<br>Class Name: PRAD255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was very nice and offered great personal stories that added to the overall class experience. As long as you paid attention in class and reviewed what the book said you were able to get a decent grade! Tests were difficult but she was very eager to help you improve your grade with Extra Credit opportunities and help you review the material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great friendly teacher with a lot of experience in PR. Tests are long, but multiple choice and T/F and the answers are easy if you paid any attention during class. She is very easy on the eyes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2012<br>Class Name: PRA255<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly, do not take her. She is more concerned about telling the class about how much success she has personally had, rather than teaching us. Very confusing. Even though she knows everything about Public relations, she has no idea how to teach it. So frustrating.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2011<br>Class Name: PRAD255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She talks very fast which makes it hard to understand the material but if you read the book on your own you will be fine.  Also, she offers extra credit and the final is more then half of the exact questions from previous exams so if you study those you are pretty much get an easy A on the final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2011<br>Class Name: PRAD255<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice woman but does not seem to understand how to teach a college level class. The exams were extremely difficult and no one ever got over a B, most people got lower than a C. I would not take a class with this teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2011<br>Class Name: PRAD255<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is nice person and has a lot of experience in the PR field, but has a teacher she is not very good. She is constantly getting off topic in class about her own business and her tests are insane. 3 tests 90 multiple choice questions and an essay. Stay away.</div></div></div></body></html>
