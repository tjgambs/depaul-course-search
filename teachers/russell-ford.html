He was totally arrogant and cocky. His exams were IMPOSSIBLE. It's all short answer/essay, you had to write out actual definitions for some of the terms, then answer essay questions that he was really hard and specific in grading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/27/2005<br>Class Name: PHL200LEVEL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this professor is a wonderful man, highly intelligent, and i really enjoy his lectures. he is accommodating if you approach him.  i did okay. however, the lectures often went over the top of everyone's head.  only take the class if you are smart, seriously.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2005<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>bravo - very stimulating and informative.  challenging for those who can handle him.  a shame he's not still around.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2005<br>Class Name: BUSSETHICS<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was okay but I think he wanted too much.  He should realize that it was a lower level course.  He also did not explain well what he wanted. His test were hard. I am use to getting A's out of classes he gave me a B-. Talk to him I think that helps you out in the end.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2005<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AT first I saw this class as a challenge and begin to apply myself then after I got a's on exams and perfect attendance and he gave me a C in the class I just thought he was a jerk. What I learned in this class was not worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2005<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>People who whine and complain about him are the kids who were freeriders in high school and never really had to do any work. He'll work you hard but in the end he does care about his students and he does his best to cater to different needs. Extremely intelligent, highly reccommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2005<br>Class Name: BUSETHICS<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At First I thought the class seemed ok, then I got to know the professor who is an annoying, indie rocker wannabe.  The class is incredibly boring, the test are hard, and the teacher thinks he is gods gift to the world; if that sounds good to you then take the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>pompous, arrogant and mean enough said</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a good professor don't get me wrong, and very intelligent; just that it was hard.  Philosophy seemed like 'a not that bad of a course' when I was going in to take it, but it made it harder than it really was for me.  It seemed that I would understand everything, but once I got the test...I do</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely the hardest 100 lvl class Ive ever taken.Heck,the hardest class period. Tough tests, quite a bit of reading to do. HAVE to post on blackboard, otherwise no HW.

This class is EXTREMELY difficult! He is very arrogant and just talks the whole time, leaving no room for questions, and then he complains that no one asks questions.

There is a LOT of reading to do, and when you ask him a question, he'll say, &quot;It was in the reading.&quot; How about explanining it&#63; He also doesn't give you a good idea of what will be on the tests.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2005<br>Class Name: BUSETHICS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's hot... and a great teacher too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2004<br>Class Name: BUSETHICS<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he makes the lectures as interesting as possible, considering the subject.  easy grader.  class participation is important, and so is keeping up with the reading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2004<br>Class Name: BUSPHL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Was a tough course with a lot of reading.

The topic itself is pretty complicated so props to him for being a good explainer-compared to other prof in this area.
