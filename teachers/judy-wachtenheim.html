First thing, you will have to write a paper (required for 320). You will learn a lot from it, but she grades hard on it.  Midterm is easy if you do the study guide she gives you. Test doesn't go as in depth as the guide. Try to ask questions during class, she writes down who participates</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2015<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor was extremely knowledgeable about the industry and provides great real world examples. Tests are difficult but manageable if you study. She wants to make sure you understand the material instead of memorizing, overall one of the best professors at DePaul. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2014<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Lots of material, but she is very clear and goes through it very well. i learned so much. Her tests are probably some of the most fairest tests out there. No surprises. Just wish she was a bit easier grader on the paper</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2013<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wealth of experience that she incorporates into the class making it feel practical as opposed to busy work. Writes very detailed notes on the board and provides study guides that prepare well. Consisted of midterm, final and a paper. Both tests are MC. Paper takes work, but As are given so put in the work and you'll get the grade. Highly recommend</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2013<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very boring. She writes down her printed slides, and reads them to the class. She gets pleasure out of failing students, and this is coming from someone who did fair in her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2012<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very organized.  As long as you go to class take good notes and do her study guide you will be set.Do not wait till Midterm or Finals week to the study Guide.  She updates it every week so keep up with it.She grades hard on the paper, but she looks at outlines.  So if you are missing important information she will point it out.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2012<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doesn't appear to be interested in the students. Tries to come off as knowledgeable instead of teaching. She admittedly makes her exams like puzzles and tries to throw students off. Written assignment graded as hard/harder than writing course</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2012<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>smart, helpful, if you want to know money and banking when you walk out of the class, this is the class, you will be smarter when you leave Guaranteed! this is why you go to depaul to get a teacher like this</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2012<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher, she acts like she knows what she is talking about but looks down at her notes like they are they bible. She is extremely rude and will make her students feel stupid. Hard grader for no reason, and has no actual knowledge in her teachings. Stay away if you are a finance major, or any other major. way too hard of a class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2012<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wachtenheim is VERY knowledgable about the subject and puts it into language students can understand, no matter the major. Relates all material to the real world. Extremely responsive to email. Participation is required. Midterm, paper, final. You will learn a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2012<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is very clear. Does a great job teaching and helping students understand the material. Very tough grader on paper. Make sure you understand the topic and requirements. Midterm and final are decent, but you need to spend a good amount of time on material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2011<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't buy the book. She writes all the notes on the board. Just write them down and listen and review them before the midterm and final and you'll get an A. Paper is pretty easy but super long. She takes participation seriously so do it and don't be late to class. Overall I would recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2011<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was fairly easy. There is a paper, midterm and final. She is a hard grader on the papers. The midterm is straightforward but it is only about 45 questions, so if you get a few wrong you mihgt get a B. Make sure you participate in class because there is an attendance/participation grade.</div></div></div></body></html>
