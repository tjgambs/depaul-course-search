Rusch is nice (has Austrian accent). One short book required. Too much writing in (all writing is single-spaced).  I found that she grades easily. She floods you with emails. No exams. Took a while to get into the games/movies portion of the class--spent too many weeks on the moral theories.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2013<br>Class Name: GAM224<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very very nice person. She's always cheerful and happy to answer questions. Strict grader. She never lets you know how you're faring in class. Classes were mostly fun. The projects didn't make sense. She's also really attractive. Awesome accent too</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2013<br>Class Name: GAM226<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really cool person, pretty good professor. Very passionate about games, but sometimes it gets to her head. She doesn't let you forget this is a class about the very core elements of games, but creating a game was a fun process. Early on she's a critical grader, but the final wasn't difficult to ace and fun to do. Overall a fun teacher and class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2011<br>Class Name: GAM226<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty knowledgeable about the field of Game design, but can sometimes get to carried away with the inner emotion of the game</div></div></div></body></html>
