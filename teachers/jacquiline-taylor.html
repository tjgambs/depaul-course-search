She is by far the worst teacher I have ever had at DePaul.  She basically makes you feel really little in front of others, and if your not an actor, good luck, I thought ISP was suppose to be fun&#63;  She is very one sided and places her political aspects on everyone and expects you to agree with her.  DO NOT TAKE HER!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2005<br>Class Name: COMM<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2005<br>Class Name: COM<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hate this teacher, she has favorites and if your not one of them, you won't do good in her class...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/06/2005<br>Class Name: PERFORMANCELIT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great lady, easy class, laid back, helpful, funny, take this class, easy A if you do the readings(which aren't bad, they are all stories or poems) and practice before you perform.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2005<br>Class Name: CMN230<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Uniquely boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2005<br>Class Name: COMM<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is by far the worse teacher I've ever seen.

I dreaded taking this class because I'm a senior transfer student and it was required for my degree.  It has ended up being one of the most fun and enlightening classes I have taken.  I pity those who can't benefit.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2003<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really enjoyed this class--Dr. Taylor is enthusiastic, has lots of crazy family stories, and is very knowledgeable. Her writing assignments are very detailed and clear, if you follow them you'll get A's on your papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2003<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the ONLY Multicultural ISP I've heard of and experienced to be GREAT!  The others seem boring, but Taylor makes it fun and chooses the perfect curriculum with films and literature to relate with out generation!  But you have to follow the readings</div></div></div></body></html>
