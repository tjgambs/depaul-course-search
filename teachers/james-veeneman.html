Hes a fun and interesting guy. The entire class is based off of slides that he makes you read in every class. Everyting is off the slides. Dont buy the book. Encourage group exams. All in all it was a good experience although im sure some accounting students would disagree.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/06/2010<br>Class Name: ACC542<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really wish he spent more time teaching the core material than reminiscing about his worldly experiences.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2010<br>Class Name: ACC502<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Veeneman was disorganized and underprepared.  He constantly throws UofC in your face, with his slides and personal experience there.  He assigns large amounts of reading but does not make clear what will be tested and what will not.  I did not care for his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2010<br>Class Name: ACC201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>James needs to be less self-centered and concentrate on teaching. He needs to stop talking about his personal accomplishments and preference, and concentrate on why he is at De Paul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2010<br>Class Name: ACC542<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Funny professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2010<br>Class Name: ACC502<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am usually pretty forgiving of teachers in general but this class was upsetting.  Not only did we work on numerous projects that weren't evealuated in any way the professor was a constant name dropper in a bad way.  He eluded to experiences in banking but had no subsatnce in real business or accounting.  Poor class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2010<br>Class Name: ACC502<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. One of the best class I have ever had at DePaul. Not only the theories we learned but also be applied in the real world. The teaching of this class might be different with other business classes. A lot of readings, hard work,etc. You will earn a good grade if you follow his logic. I had enjoyable time in this class. Good luck!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2009<br>Class Name: ACC542<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had a friend take this class and warn me about him.  He was all over the place, telling lots of personal anecdotes that didn't always connect to the topics.  I didn't really learn much in this class and didn't care to spend much time preparing. He was entertaining though. Related stuff back to current events.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/24/2009<br>Class Name: ACC502<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy was a joke. Virtually no feedback was received on any of the lengthy weekly assignments or the midterm paper. Some weeks this course seemed more like macro-economics than management accounting. Also, it was extremely nauseating to listen to him go on about his fundraising trips for the University of Chicago and the constant name dropping.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/22/2009<br>Class Name: ACC502<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The WORST professor in DePaul. He always talked about something that not related to class. Also interrupted when you answered his question. He didn't follow the syllabus at all. A lot of homework and extra papers. You'll never how he graded.  He is an UNFAIR GRADER with no reason.  I got nothing from this class. Only paid $3,160 for A-.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2008<br>Class Name: ACC502<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Complete waste of my tuition money.  All he talked about were his trips to S. America, his family, and how great the University of Chicago is.  I learned next to nothing.  It is very unfortunate that he is the only one teaching this class, because it is a required class for the Management Accouting concentration.  Don't take if you want to learn.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2008<br>Class Name: ACC542<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Veeneman sucks for Cost Accounting 542. Plusses: he?s funny and dresses sharp.  Downsides:  Doesn?t keep his word ?he told our class that only certain things would be on the final, then tested us on other topics anyway.  Copious amounts of homework.  Favors weaker students.  Wastes time on useless material. Very disorganized.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher ever.  Great guy and makes class fun. He is really helpful and really cares about his students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2007<br>Class Name: ACCT303<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Oh my God. Sooo eassyyy!!! Honestly, I had to take a class with McCarthy a semester before taking this professor, and let me just say that I am very happy I dropped that idiot McCarthy for Acct. 303. This guy makes you want to love accounting. If you take this class, if you barely study, you are handed a B. Basically, it takes an idiot to get lower</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2007<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are looking for an easy class in a very difficult area of accounting, take this professor; however, if you are close to taking the CPA exam, this professor is probably not a very good choice. He is easy and basically hands you a B/A. He is very thorough, intelligent, and well-rounded of his job.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2007<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He loves accounting and really wants his students to do well in the class.. the grade is basically handed to you.. he can get off topic quite a bit but can make a 3 hour class fun and not boring. Nice guy. Very intelligent. He used too many sources to teach the class that it got confusing sometimes...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2007<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was great!  He's interested in you actually learning the material - not just fulfilling a credit.  I STRONGLY recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jim is the Man. Which is what he often says when complimenting a student. Very friendly and personable. One of the most intelligent profs ive ever had. Impressive credentials yet down to earth. Offers class sessions on Saturday if needed to get material across to students. Made difficult class easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2007<br>Class Name: ACC543<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is one of the best classes I have ever taken. The professor encouraged us to discuss and share our thoughts or ideas in class. What really impressed me is that the professor sacrificed his Saturdays for review session. He definitely maximizes your tuition $3,000. He made us study really hard but you feel really good at the end. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2007<br>Class Name: ACC543<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is excellent teacher,very helpfule and friendly,makes class v interactive and brings in practical examples of teaching course material.I would recommend him taking for cost and financial accounting.i learnt a lot and it is very rare a professor giving respect to students .encourages his students and a fair grader.u get a grade what u have learnt</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2007<br>Class Name: ACC542<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy. Understands Cost Accounting very well. Willing to help everyone do well in the class. However, EXCESSIVE on the homework. If I were a full time student and did not work, the homework would have been fine.  But juggling two classes toward my masters and working is difficult when you have 20 plus hours of homework.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2007<br>Class Name: ACCT542<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very kind, very passionate and always considerate about students's situation. He sacrifices lot of his leisure time helping students to reveiw the lecture. He always make student laugh. He bought CPA exam question CD  for all the class to help us prepare for the future career with his own money. a great professor and adviser!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2007<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor I have ever had.  He cares only about being liked not teaching.  He throws pizza parties, talks extensively about pop stars, gives the students copies of the test banks, barters grades, and even paid student memberships!  I recvd an A because I memorized the test bank he gave out for the final exam not from learning the material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2006<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Veeneman makes the time go by so fast when he's teaching accounting.  He maximizes your tuition dollars.  His teaching style is original and his passion for accounting REALLY shows in each lecture he gives.  I wish though that there was a booklet of all his lecture notes.  There were a lot of print-outs!!!  He needs to teach more night classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2006<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is just great professor. We worked hard in this class, but we learned a lot!! He cares about students. He is very smart. Just good guy and fair. I wish he could teach every sigles acc classes at Depaul. Take him...b/c&quot; end of the day...You feel better&quot;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/29/2006<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very unorganized.Talks about things not related to accounting at all.I know more about his personal life than i do about accting.He doesn't teach anything then assigns rediculously long HW assignments.COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!DO NOT TAKE IF YOU WANT TO LEARN.I have a 3.5 GPA so Im not an angry slacker who got a bad grade.The most terrible prof ever.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2006<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pros: Very passionate about accounting.  More importantly, he really wants you to learn and understand everything covered in the class.  He expects a lot of time and effort but seems to grade fairly.  Cons:  Needs to be more organized and timely with notes and problem sets.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2006<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Veeneman is an excellent professor. He demands time and effort and some of my other classes suffered as a result. Prepare accordingly. A challenging and rewarding learning experience, although I did feel the second half of the course was rushed and unorganized.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2006<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He has a plethora of trivial knowledge to share with his students.  He is one of the best accounting professors I have ever had.  He takes the time out to learn student's names and there will be class participation. There is a LOT of work involved, but his lectures and his notes will definitely help you prepare for the CPA.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2006<br>Class Name: SSA496<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the worst class I have taken. His stories and unrelated comments took away from valuable learning time and wasted tuition money. He is very intelligent but does not know how to pass on the knowledge. Class consists of him talking instead of teaching. I was disappointed in his lack of organization during each class and the quarter overall.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2006<br>Class Name: SSA496<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was one of the most interesting classes I've taken at U of C. His teaching style and personality combine dramatically! Too few professors care so much about the beauty and curiosity of learning. He engaged students and truly facilitated mutual learning. Jim is highly ethical and places high performance standards on students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2005<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Veeneman is amazing! He is a walking encyclopedia of Accountancy. He has the utmost passion for the accounting profession. He provides you with a wide variety of informative article (HBR), reviews, helpful handout. A lot of CPA problems, a lot! Oh Captain, my Captain, thank you for making the course tough and for making all of us work hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is about as good as it gets. He is without a doubt the best accounting teacher I have ever had. He works you hard but it is for a reason. He wants you to be the best and that is exactly what you become. He is an assistant dean at U of C GSB and I can tell why. He is extremly inteligent. Veeneman is a great guy and even better role modle!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My classmates and I have observed cheating taking place during the class time review of the problem sets.  Individuals are erasing existing answers and replacing them with the correct answers as the prof. gives them.  Since the grading is on a curve, I feel this has adversely affected my grade and the grades of others who do not change answers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2005<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First of all, his hmwk sets do not take 4 hrs to do like he says.  I spent about 15+ hrs to do them.  That's b/c i was going for an A.  Otherwise, pretty funny guy, shares lots of stories, and relates acctg to everything.  Still, i dont regret taking the course.  It's not hard b/c of him, the material IS challenging.  If you're a real acct,take him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2005<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Veeneman is a great instructor. I had a night class and he kept all of us awake by telling iteresting stories adn relating everything to the subject. By far the most dedicated and smart teacher I have had. He is very helpful and detail oriented. Would recommend him for anyone. Lot of work and a lot of learning.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2005<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor V is a great and very helpful person.Two problems:assumes that we do not just like accounting, we love it and he thinks that we are at least as smart as he is.if your major is accounting and you can challenge his lectures  you'll enjoy it otherwise .......He was very fair with grading and respectful towards everybody.20 h homework/week.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2005<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked Jim V's teaching style.  I think he has a lot to offer and I learned a lot.  That said, do not take ACC 555 in the summer, it's a ton of work.   V also needs to follow up on what he says he's going to do and be more organized.  Often times I didn't have the lecture slides because the were posted late.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2005<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent instructor.  Strongly recommend but be advised, the work level for ACC555 is extremely high if not excessive.  I typically multiplied his weekly estimates by a factor of 2-3.  His weekly problem sets were 15-20 hours each week in addition to the readings.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2005<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An amazing teacher. He brought together a lot of concepts from past classes, and he managed to make the class interesting. I'd strongly recommend taking his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2005<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher at Depaul.  Networked, highly intelligent, and a great motivator.  Take at least one class with him.  He is the poster child of how a professional business person carries themseselves.  It was a simple C.  The A is not hard, it just takes some work.  He is the only teacher that was worth $1,600 for the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2005<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is not good about getting notes up on time but, had a take-home midterm- lowest grade you could get was a C, and we went over it and you could argue if you got a different answer. He always bought us pizza and soda. His lecture and exams are not the same- lecture is general concepts-- while exams are concepts and solving problems.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2005<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
