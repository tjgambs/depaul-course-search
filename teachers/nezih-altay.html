However, his class is graded so unfairly and his tests are very hard (esp the final which I studied several hours for- it looked hardly like the material he taught us and I paid attention in class and took notes). This should be an easy A business class, but Altay's games are graded unfairly too </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2013<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take the class with this professor, he is funny and explains material well, but his exams and class competitions are so hard and graded unfair !!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2013<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is enthusiastic and knowledgeable, learnt a lot in class but lots of reading. Exams are tough and be prepared to work hard. Keeps class interesting and HW is good method to learn the material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2012<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Vague and unhelpful. Rude towards those individuals who really need help. Class was way too difficult for a basic biz requirement class. Take a different professor- I've heard the class is MUCH easier w/ others.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2012<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Enjoyable class, engaging professor, lectures are full of relevant outside examples.  Do the reading/assignments and participate and you can do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2012<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Often got off track during class. Midterm and final are HARD. Even if you pay attention and study. His 3 section average for the final was 64%. He plays favorites and is vague when you ask for help. Don't take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/15/2011<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>pretty funny guy. pay attention and follow his ppts. the book isnt really needed, he told us that. but if you want to be thorough i would get an old version. his tests are not the easiest though...avg midterm was 76.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2011<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy, funny, interesting, gives lots of examples which make things easier to understand and remember, would recommend!!! The two games are fun but if you dont do well it might effect your final grade as they worth 20% but it is duable and not hard and the lowest score is 70%. Lectures are very clear so I didnt use the book. Good luck!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2010<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It is a huge class, lots of work. Dr. A is a knowledgeable guy, class is interesting. DO NOT buy the book for 200 something bucks. He doesn?t follow it. I recommend him, he is one though grader though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2010<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Enthusiastic teacher with great sense of humor.  Very helpful.  Exams are kinda tough, based mainly on lectures, cases, and articles (posted on BB).  But if you keep up with case/article readings, you'll do fine.  Textbook is seldom used, if at all.  Participation is huge.  I highly recommend him, but I believe he's taking a year off for research.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2010<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Seems like the guy has lots of experience and his way of teaching is great. You will learn lots in class but still will be required to study hard in order to do well on the exams. Helpful instructor and open for office hours</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2010<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very funny teacher. His powerpoint slides are very short and do not help much so you have to attend class because his exams are based on his inclass lectures. Exams are hard if you do not attend class. I did not like the grading on the two games you play in groups in class. If your group doesn't do good you will automatically get a 70 for games.</div></div></div></body></html>
