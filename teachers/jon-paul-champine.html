Passionate about the topics he teaches. Dedicated to helping his students learn. That's what matter as a university teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2008<br>Class Name: RS254<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He Keeps you on your feet. slack on any one graded component and your final grade will suffer. Stay the course, and you should get a good grade at course's end. Nothing worth having is easily obtained. It requires serious effort on ur part. What matters most is that Dr. Champine cares about students' learning outcome; it shows in his lectures . . .</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2008<br>Class Name: REL254<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I suggest looking to take another religion class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/29/2008<br>Class Name: REL254<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very open minded. Was very helpful in answering questions outside of class. Not judgmental of personal examples used, encouraged class participation. Its hard when you get a class full of apathetic people though. Really good prof. Take him. And do your journals.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2008<br>Class Name: REL254<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A truly dedicated teacher! I'll admit that this isn't the easiest class to ace but you're a lazy bum if you're complaining that his tests are too hard. He is very clear on important material and gives very clear notes for every class. Very interesting class and I love his enthusiasm towards understanding others' viewpoints. Would take him again! :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2008<br>Class Name: REL254<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Now here is an example of a true professional, both passionate about his subject matter as he is dedicated to his students' achievment with the material. He is a very sweet guy, but he won't take slacker C#*p either. Makes psychologists look good! Does he teach other classes&#63; We are lucky to have a field professional teaching at our school.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2007<br>Class Name: REL254<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Must have changed teaching style.. Worst teacher ever. Class average on midterm was 11/25...not fair...TONS of reading. Seems like a nice guy, but is not</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/02/2007<br>Class Name: REL254<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is super nice and super easy. Sometimes he would stop in the middle of his lectures and tell us to go home because we looked bored. The key to passing is to making sure to complete a 1 page reading journal for every reading. He collects it once during midterms and once at the end.</div></div></div></body></html>
