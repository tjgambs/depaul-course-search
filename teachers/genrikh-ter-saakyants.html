Ask a question and he'll say it's easy. There's only 2 exams and 1 final, with a few extra credit quizzes. You can use notes on the quizzes and exams, but the problems are so abstracted from the HW that whatever you studied doesn't help much. Hard to tell what he'll give on exams. Withdraw & take another prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2005<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>horrible, cant teach if life depended on it. basically expects everyone to know the material, then whats the point of the class&#63; didnt explain problems, quiz/test were nothing near the homework.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/25/2005<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/23/2005<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i got placed into this bs class...no problem, but when i get a teacher who doesnt know how to teach, THATS THE PROBLEM!  he tells us whats going to be on the test, yet somehow 9 out of the problems were not related to what he told us.  what kind of garbage is that&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow I love hime he was so nice and he loved to teach everything well</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/13/2005<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>confusing, arrogant and at times plain rude! gave us problems that were supposed to be on the final, then gave us totally different ones on the actual exam! quite misleading. doesn't explain much and likes to make students feel very stupid when they ask questions. stay away</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2004<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very Easy.
