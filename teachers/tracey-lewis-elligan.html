She was unclear in the beginning of the quarter, but towards the end she was much more organized.  The first two weeks are boring, but after it is a lot of more fun material</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2015<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very disorganized teacher, she never knows what she is talking about and never made lesson plans for our class. I was highly confused what was going on the whole quarter and did not learn anything.  Avoid her if possible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2015<br>Class Name: SOC207<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>dont understand the really high reviews. she is an average teacher at best, and doesnt do a great job even telling you what you're learning about. assignments dont relate to class material at all, and i never opened the textbooks once and still passed the class with flying colors.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2015<br>Class Name: SOC207<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>3 4 page papers, 1 7 page & 2 exams. Lectures are largely based on conversations. Tracey really does have great perspective and has exposed me to new ideas and ways of thinking. I would recommend her. We read maybe 3 novels. Nothing is very heavy to be honest. Absolutely manageable. Mostly reflective stuff. Class was overall rewarding.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2014<br>Class Name: SOC223<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My main concern with her class this term is her terrible time management. We are about a week behind on the syllabus, and we rarely have time to discuss promised topics or even go over midterm expectations. Overall she's pleasant and intelligent, but I would recommend a different professor if you prefer an efficient and well-organized class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2013<br>Class Name: SOC460<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Lewis Elligan is one of the best at DePaul. Super intelligent, thoughtful, insightful. She is passionate about her course topics, and really cares about student's opinions and if they are grasping the concepts. Her courses are by no means "easy," they will challenge you to think and demand time. But the payoff is worth it. Great person too!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/31/2013<br>Class Name: SOC223<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Be prepared for a lot of class discussions. Reading is a bit light. And she's a pleasant professor. Just show up, participate, and do the assignments as she asks and the class will be an easy breeze.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her for race and ethnicity. There are four assignments in the class each worth 25% of your grade, a midterm, a 5 page paper about your family background, a 4 page paper about the movie Crash and a 8 page research paper. Fairly easy grader, just a lot of work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2012<br>Class Name: SOC223<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was ok, not too demanding. A 1pg reflection paper every wk. A midterm, research final paper, presentaion, and another presentation from a poster. She will take attendance every class for the first 6wks.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2009<br>Class Name: SOC235<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So Adol Health class where we barely talked about adol health. Complete waste of time. Professor doesn't know what she's talking about. No interesting topics. She relied on students to teach the only time we actually talked about topics related to class. And there's too much reading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2008<br>Class Name: SOC235<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's nice but the class is not all that easy. . you will work for ur grade, several papers, mid-term was pretty hard- class average was like 76%. . not an easy A but and ok class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2008<br>Class Name: SOC235<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was definitely not one of my favorite professors at DePaul. She's laid back, but the class was kind of taken over by students, and I think I learned more from my peers' presentations than from her. There was no passion in her class and we were all pretty annoyed with how unorganized she was. Nice lady though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2007<br>Class Name: SOC465<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoy Tracey. She was a delight. She is smart, articulate and made the subject matter totally easy to understand. If you take her be prepared to work, and if you don't wanna then why are you in college&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2007<br>Class Name: SOC400<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>to be honest she is pretty clueless. there were two guys in our class that seemed to be more knowledgeable about health and the healthcare system. They answered alot of questions that she wasnt able to. Alot of times, she kind of rambled on aimlessly. Its an easy course but she does pick favorites and is boring as hell.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: SOC<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SHE ROCKED&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;EASY GRADER, BORING LECTURES BUT STILL EASY A....TAKE HER</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2005<br>Class Name: SOC235<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>take her as many times as you can at Depaul! shes by far the best teacher at this school</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2005<br>Class Name: SOC221<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor; extremely gracious! She loves class discussions and we get to compete in mock trials. Thought provoking lectures. Read about her online and she likes hip hop and I read about her husband too! They both seem cool.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2005<br>Class Name: SOC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a really nice lady, and pretty cool. Her lectures can get kinda boring, but then again who's doesn't. I got an A in the class and didn't buy the book. She's a good teacher, and really cool.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2005<br>Class Name: SOC394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought she was awesome! She is easy as hell, she is not a hard grader at all, she's helpful, wonderful, and if you're a soc major take her because I guarantee you'll walk away with an A in the class!! She is very flexible with everything, and she won't penalize you for late work, I recommend her!</div></div></div></body></html>
