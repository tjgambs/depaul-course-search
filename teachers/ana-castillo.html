This tended to hinder the level of energy in class, because students weren't pushed to respond. The readings were enjoyable, but her guidelines for assignments were sometimes confusing. Con- not the most energetic lecturer. Pro- no weekly written responses, although there are two big writing assignments for ENG 409.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: ENG309<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the worst &quot;professor&quot; ever. She takes a fun topic and turns it into misery. You have to write the way SHE wants you to, or else she shreds it to pieces. Don't try and be creative- she despises it. I think she puts people down to make herself seem more credible. This class was a waste of time and MONEY. She should crawl back under her rock.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2005<br>Class Name: ENG210<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>NO NO and NO! I warn you not to take her class! Her writing is excellent but when it comes to other student's work, she chews it up, gives you crappy feedback, and then when you go to ask her a question,she always gives the most vauge responses. The people in class were more help than her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2005<br>Class Name: ENG<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked her class a lot. There is a lot of writing and very little feedback, but i'd say you learn more from peers than the professor. She is very stringent on due dates and does not appreciate absences or tardies. (dirty looks, etc) Do NOT make the mistake of missing the 1st day of her class...bad impressions tend to stick with her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2005<br>Class Name: ENG369<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the worst professors at Depaul! She should have just stuck to writing because she can't relate to anyone but herself.  Don't ask questions because she will get annoyed.  Extremly unclear and very flakey.  Easy class but not worth dealing with her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/13/2005<br>Class Name: LST310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ana is so full of herself that she should teach a class about herself.  I don't know why she asks a question, according to her, she has all the right answers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2004<br>Class Name: ENG210<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her for fiction writing.She was completly uninvolved with her students and their writing. She is here because she looks good on DePaul's resume. She is the stupid and lazy man's Sandra Cisneros and needs to get over herself</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2003<br>Class Name: LST<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very demanding in an odd sort of way. Sometimes you're not sure what she's asking for. Just be yourself in her class, read the readings, and don't give her an inch!</div></div></div></body></html>
