He reminds me of a sweet grandfather :) He really knows his stuff as he has had extensive experience in both the film and TV fields. He always wants to ensure that we understand everything, as he does have a thick Russian accent but you get used to it. Take him!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2012<br>Class Name: DC105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class for any of his classes.

Extremely knowledgeable with movies and has lived through a cinematographic life which he seldom mentions. (He has won 4 Emmies!) Get to know him and if you love film analysis like I do then talk to him. Aronovich is the man!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2012<br>Class Name: DC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>VERY AWESOME TEACHER!

There is no textbook for Intro to TV production, it's all more hands-on experience. Just a final which so far doesn't seem like it's going to be hard. He is always giving us feedback in what to do better and what we have done right. Might take him for another class next term.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2011<br>Class Name: DC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is the man.
