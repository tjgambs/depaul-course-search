He is smart but also super unforgiving. If you are the type of person who might miss class or procrastinate this isn't the teacher for you. Also he changes the syllabus a lot, and does not have a D2L page. You must be a really good note taker and type A personality. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2015<br>Class Name: PPS251<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Sampson is old school, but he is a huge source of information. Although disagreeing with conservative arguments, gave one of the most thorough understandings of it, despite other reviewer, and no, doesn't pick favorites on class or race. Really amazing and enlightening, takes care of his students. Wouldn't take if not public policy major.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible professor. Preaches reverse racism, refuses to hear opinions outside of his own with utter arrogance, and picks favorites choosing to explicitly seek out African Americans, rich or not, and identify them with struggles they don't have. Utterly coddling them. If you're white, he essentially marginalizes and degrades you and your values.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/10/2012<br>Class Name: PPS302<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I LOVE Sampson's classes! He IS very tough & expects you, as a somewhat intellectual college student, to actually try. There really isn't much reading, but you should do it. He might be tough but he has experience in the field. As long as you TRY & ask questions, he'll grade you fairly. & don't argue with him! You'll always lose! But he's great!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2012<br>Class Name: PUBLI351<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Sampson does talk a lot about Black and Latino issues. I feel it is his field and I feel it is appropriate. He get off subject often, but the things that he digress about are important social issues. If you do not like to be confronted with racial issues you should not take his class, then again you should not be in public policy either.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2011<br>Class Name: PPS352<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you plan to take Dr. Sampson's class, forget everything you know, because it simply does not matter to him.  The class discussions were very narrow-minded. I highly suggest you meet the guy before taking his class so you can determine if you want to put up with his teaching style.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/20/2011<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely knowledgeable professor, wrote several books and has Ph.D and formerly taught at Northwestern University.

He spents whole class talking about his past experiences of Northwestern Univeristy, PhD experience, and very little about the topic.

Says that people aren't as smart as think they are. Picks favorites. He's has a PhD and expects every student to think that way.

You just have to be serious about what you are learning or he'll call you out on it. I recommend ALL of his classes as I have taken multiple of them. He can come off as arrogant but he definitely earned the right. Honestly, if you want to get your money's worth for your tuition take his classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2009<br>Class Name: PPS301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sampson = Awesome</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2009<br>Class Name: PPS251<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OMG! stay away from his classes! he's a very smart man but also very arrogant.

Sure he expects a lot from the students, but it seems he really cares about those students who truly and want to LEARN. He doesn't give a lot of feedback because he expects you to figure it out. But he is an interesting and smart professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2008<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow I worked my ass off in this class and only got a B. He definitely picks favorites within the first week of class and it is clearly visible as to who he dislikes. You will definitely lose participation points that way as well because he won't call on you. Don't take this class if you want to keep your dignity.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2008<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher and pretty funny!He cares about his students.

He was incredibly rude to me when I asked him for guidance and even suggested that I was trying to &quot;manipulate&quot; him for extra help.  I was so shocked by his behavior I nearly cried.  Deplorable attitude I changed my major b/c of him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2008<br>Class Name: PPSSECT<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Sampson is amazing.  If you want an easy class, don't take any he teaches.  If you don't plan to attend every class, don't take him.  But if you plan to learn, think critically, challenge, and be challenged, he is a GREAT professor. He does choose favorites, yes, but his favorites are the students who attend class and contribute to conversation</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2007<br>Class Name: PPS201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is 4 learning beyond a  book. His truth can b awkward, but NECESSARY in order to grasp the material. Ok kiddies, ur in college,time to think of all sides of race&class in the context of PUB policy.

They do not allow themselves to critically examine their own thought process.  His teaching style is unorthodox with tangents and personal, put-on-the-spot questions, but discourse is necessary in discussion of social issues</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2007<br>Class Name: PPS201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you take really good notes, go to class and study the main topics, you should be fine.I know he loves to be complimented so go ahead and give back his own ideas, not the best thing to say about a teacher but its true.You CAN learn from him, it might just not be in the way you want to.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2007<br>Class Name: PPS201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take him if you really want to learn something.Show up to class EVERY DAY, take good notes and you'll do fine. 2 tests, paper. doesn't make you take the 2nd test if you get a B or up on the first one.Don't buy the books.He makes the test out to be much harder than it actually is-I was paranoid about it but easily got a B and relaxed rest of quarter</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2007<br>Class Name: PPS201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think that many students at DePaul just don't understand Dr. Sampson's way of teaching.  He may seem tough but I believe that he is one of the most venerable professors at DePaul.

He teaches you his opinion, and you better agree if you want to pass, but even if you agree you might get a bad grade.  He totally seems resentful towards the Caucasian population it seems.

He expects his students to work hard for their grades. Take all the notes you can and read all the chapters he assigns.
