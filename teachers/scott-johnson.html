As stated below, the class is YouTube videos every day. I didn't mind this, but the manner in which he showed us these videos was wildly unprofessional. He is very crude and anything but helpful.

Very clear about what he expects, but is also extremely flexible.  If anything, he is way too nice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2003<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's the best teacher you could take!

He gets straight to the point and is always hyper, which is great with an 8:30 class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2003<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher I ever had.  Does not bs students with things they dont need to know.  Points out only the need things from the readings.  Very easy but at the same time informative.  Students respect this man.  Very good with helping students through e-mail</div></div></div></body></html>
