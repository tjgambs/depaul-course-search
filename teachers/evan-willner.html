He has been the most quick and clear in email responses of any prof ive had, and has a robust knowledge of and passion for the subject. The previous posters sound like they weren't really prepared to dedicate time to a upper level class. Never had any problems with EW and dont know ne1 who has</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2009<br>Class Name: ENG382<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm surprised at the number of comments that say &quot;if you are an english major/if you love poetry, then this class doesn't suck.&quot; who takes a 300 level english course that isn't majoring in it&#63; not only is that not really permitted, but it's not logical. maybe you should go to your adviser next time since you don't know how to register for classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2009<br>Class Name: ENG382<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yummy Yummy Screw</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2009<br>Class Name: ENG382<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is really  useless. if u email him for help he'll just repeat the assignment or make u feel like u should already know something. very very condescending. only makes an effort to talk to kids that are HARD CORE ENGLISH/POETRY fans. find another class/teacher if u are just looking to fulfill the art/lit req. he plays favorites.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2009<br>Class Name: ENG382<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Only take this if you are a serious English major who loves poetry. I am neither, so staying until the end of every class and having to buy about 10 books wasn't fun. He is a nice man, he just talks a lot and really loves this subject so the class kind of falls asleep. I am not a fan..but I'm sure an English major might love him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2009<br>Class Name: ENG382<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>THE WORST TEACHER AT DEPAUL. he changes his syllabus 3 weeks before the end of the quarter & instead of a revised essay he expects a 7 pg paper. Makes u pay for 8 books plus companion books which we use in class for 10 mins. His assignments are stupid & confusing. He gets mad if u leave class yet you gain nothin from stayin. DONT TAKE HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2009<br>Class Name: ENG382<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>makes u buy like 8 different books for the class. he is an incredibly hard and unfair grader. if you are not an english major i would not take him. find another class to fill your art and lit req. boring boring boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2009<br>Class Name: ENG382<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>rambles on in class and says UMMMM alot. i wouldnt take him again. unless your really into poetry or an english major. 2 papers on a poetry analysis and a final paper that is a revision of either one. takes up alllllll of class time. he never lets you go early</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2009<br>Class Name: ENG369<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great teacher!! really funny and makes a boring class interesting! highly recommend him1 and hes so cute!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2009<br>Class Name: ENG265<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, makes class fun.

Not what I was expecting for The American Novel, but I thoroughly enjoyed the Auster readings. Great sense of humor, makes strange noises when he looks up at the clock. &quot;mehr.&quot;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2009<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor.  We had some great discussions and reade some awesome books as well.  The theme of the class was where one draws the line between the human and inhuman.  Oh yeah and he does use a lot of art and gets that involved in the lectures and discussions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2009<br>Class Name: ENG265<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him for Poetry and then for American Lit. as well. His classes are fascinating--they go all over the place, and you come away with something new every time. Ditto the other comments about his feedback. It's helpful and he is a fair grader. Take him for whatever you can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2009<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is so entertaining and knowledgeable. We didn't cover all of the poems he assigned us, but the tangential discussions were quite memorable. After each essay assignment, I improved more and more because Professor Willner makes very specific and helpful comments on the papers- better grader than any professor I've seen at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2009<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very stimulating discussions, hated the books but loved the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2008<br>Class Name: EN220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Poetry was not my thing, but he made the calss very interesting.

I have not had a teacher who would be willing to help a student so much. He is a kind of prof. who is there for us no matter what and when.

He talks about concepts that no one really understands, and he doesn't bring everything together in the end.  Ok grader, but the confusion isn't worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2008<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was never that much into literature; he made me take another look at it.

He can be a lil unorthodox(He likes to &quot;bark&quot; at ideas), and sometimes vague. Just ask questions or email him and youll be fine. This was an easy going class but he didnt let us out early (it was a night class so we only met once a week).  I would highly recomend him if you are upbeat and will work a lil bit</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy just ask if you need help!
