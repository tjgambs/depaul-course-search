His lectures were surprisingly not all that drab given the material (stats). He really demystified a lot of concepts and formulas in statistics. Lectures were always super clear and I walked away feeling like I had a good handle of stats for research. Oh, and he's super super easy too</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2014<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy, nice professor.
