However this isn't a breeze through course. Expect a good deal of work that requires effort. Assignments were mostly interesting and easy to complete.  Discussions, journals, video communication, and group work. Just get a good group. Would take her again but she's leaving DePaul after this quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2013<br>Class Name: ORGC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Good Teacher. Down to earth. Gives extensions on projects. Assigns alot of projects/speechs but they arent hard to accomplish. Take her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2013<br>Class Name: ORGC201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class requires too much work and is not worth the time or effort.  STAY AWAY!! Take MKT 376 instead.  You cannot get a perfect score on anything no matter how well you do.  The Professor makes this class more difficult than what it needs to be.  There are quizzes and tests on top of all the presentations and critiques you need to do. RUN!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2013<br>Class Name: ORGC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is very useful in preparing you for a career, but it is challenging and requires a LOT of work. Beth is knowledgeable and helpful, but I don't think she understands how much time & effort each project requires. She's a tough grader and doesn't give 100s. I spent 5x more time on this class's work than on other classes and barely got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2013<br>Class Name: ORGC201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Its a good class in that it will prepare you for a lot of things later on in your career. That said she is a very tough grader and it feels like she expects everyone to be a professional speaker. Lots of assignments and group work and I don't think she gave 100s or even 90s to anyone despite the hard work we put in.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2013<br>Class Name: ORGC201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TAKE MKT 376 INSTEAD. Took ORGC, dropped it. Filling the same criteria, Mkt 376 is much easier. It's not her, it's the class. Take ORGC if u are good at public speaking and wanna sharpen ur skill thou.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2012<br>Class Name: ORGC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>im a acc/buss major and loved this class. she made it really fun and hands on. the only class where i could name every student because she made sure we connected the first day and created a fun friendly environment. does require you to work though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2012<br>Class Name: ORGC201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very nice and friendly teacher. It was a public speaking class, but the speeches are laid back and she helps make you comfortable, and they are not the sole focus of the class. This class is a bit harder than i expected and she does grade kinda tough, but not ridiculous, you have to work to get an A. She is good and i recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2011<br>Class Name: CMNS201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Everyone should take this class!! It was so helpful to me because I had no idea how much I didn't know about job interviews...She teaches you necessary skills to have entering the job market, and above all Prof. Zoufal is awesome</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2011<br>Class Name: CMN201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take her! Great person! You will have a blast in your class! REMEMBER TO ASK HER TO USE YOUR NOTES ON QUIZES/EXAMS! Then sit back and enjoy your class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2011<br>Class Name: CMN201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sorry Professor Zoufal but I will ruin your surprize. EVERYONE ASK HER IF YOU CAN USE YOUR NOTES FOR THE QUIZ/EXAMS! We learned the hard way. She will let you so ask her in class. If you are afraid of public speaking, then this is the class to take. She will not attack you and break you down like other teachers do. Makes you feel at home. take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2010<br>Class Name: CMNS212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was great! Gives a lot of group work time, which was awesome.  She was pretty easy, and was very flexible.  Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2009<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a sweet and caring teacher clearly interested in what she teaches. She is very understanding when it comes to make-up speeches just so long as you don't try to take advantage of her. Ask for a review sheet for midterm and final which are easy anyway.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2009<br>Class Name: CMNS212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The teacher is super easy. Gives four quizzes, if you do all four you get 10 extra credit and she drops the lowest grade. Quizzes out of 30 points. She lets you use notes for the quiz, eazy A for the class. Most of time not in class because group day working on project for presentation. LOVE THIS CLASS!!!!!!1 TAKE IT IF YOU NEED IT!!!!!!EASY!!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2009<br>Class Name: CMNS220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She knows her stuff, but class lectures are boring.  Speeches are not that hard, but require preparation.  Reasoning behind grading is somewhat obscure, but she is not terribly tough grader.  Mid-term and Final (yes, in a performance class) based almost entirely off lectures.  Ask for note sheet, and you can get one.  Very good overrall</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2009<br>Class Name: CMNS220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVED this professor. She was really nice and dedicated to what she taught. I was terrified of public speaking, but she made it a great experience. Attendance not mandatory but be there to get the notes! Everything she covers is on the midterm and final. FOR THE FINAL-ASK TO USE THE NOTES AND SHE WILL LET YOU! BUT ONLY IF YOU ASK!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very good teacher.  She makes the class very interesting and shows how to apply the concepts in real life.  FYI - IF YOU WILL ASK, SHE WILL LET YOU BRING NOTES TO THE EXAMS - BUT YOU HAVE TO ASK</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2008<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great easy going</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2008<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a good teacher that will help u a lot.  For her exams if u ask to bring a note sheet she let u.  Good teacher but talks to fast.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2007<br>Class Name: CMN360<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was initially frightened of this class, but it turned out to be one of my favorites.  Lessons can get dry, but the professor honestly cares if you succeed.  I found Dr. Zoufal to be a caring and intellectual individual.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2006<br>Class Name: CMN211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she was a really nice teacher, and you could tell she cared about her students. class was fine, and all in all i would take her again, EXCEPT,  her grading policy was really hard. the grading policy does not match the what we were taught. if you take her, be prepared to study hard on your own, or it will catch you by suprise.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2006<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a horrible grader!I got points off my midterm,yes,i said written midterm in a PERFORMING class,with no explanations.She takes points off of speeches,critiques as she wishes with no reasoning behind it,one would think she would clarify why you got points off so you can prevent it on the next speech right&#63;WRONG!Lets not forget the chicken pox!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2006<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You need to know A LOT for the exams, so be prepared to study for those two.  The speeches aren't very tough, but towards the end you are giving one every other week.  She isn't specific on why she took points off so it is hard to improve your grade.  She is nice and helpful if you need help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2006<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stay away from this class... this was supposed to be an easy class but it turned out to be one of the hardest.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2005<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The lady is so nice but man. she is crazy hard. extremely uncleear with expectations so it's hard to improve on next grade. She wants very technical and specific vocabulary and quite demanding on exams. If you take her, you should pay TOO much on detail to get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2005<br>Class Name: COMMUNICATIONS<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2005<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Where to begin.  I mean, she knows her stuff, but I hate her class.  She tries to keep us active, but I just never felt interested.  Before taking this class I was pretty excited for it because I would think that there would be more talking, communicating, blah, blah, blah, but there isn't.  She talk, she lectures, and that's pretty much. So so!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2005<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
