His lectures were amazing. You can tell that he is very passionate about theatre. He gave a few quizzes (easy) and two papers (midterm, final).

It honestly was hard not to be engaged in the class because he is so passionate when he teaches. I t made me want to work hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2011<br>Class Name: THE200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SO COOL!

I ended up looking forward to it all week. Really cool you see plays and read plays,and do some projects. Really interesting teacher, knows an enormous amount about theatre and history, he is cute too which is nice</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2011<br>Class Name: THEAT200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing class .

No textbooks required, and half of the classes will either get cancelled or you have to go see a play off campus. Really good class if you need to fill an A&L requirment</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2008<br>Class Name: THE200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is composed of a midterm paper, a final project and many small papers. There's no text book, but a lot of reading of play scripts. An A is achievable in this class but effort must be put into the class - this is not a class for slackers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2008<br>Class Name: THE200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was pretty interesting. We did a lot of things that really gave me appreciation for stage theatre. The class is a lot of work, but it is easy. Read the assignments, write a 150 word response, a mid-term, final. Participation helps too. I would recommend the class, just in the fall or spring so you won't be cold going 2 the theatre.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/22/2008<br>Class Name: THE200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is so cool.  you won't regret it. very nice and down to earth.  you get a lot of experience in many aspects of theatre</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2007<br>Class Name: THEA200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HE is so funny and so hot!
