She is really clear in lecturing and also provide study guide for the exams, in which it was helpful. There are in class quizzes, a midterm, as well as final. She helps the class to get mentally prepared for the exams and expect us to get the material. Must take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2015<br>Class Name: 102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Eva is amazing! Is super clear and teaches you everything you need to know and only what you need to know. I'm nowhere near a natural at accounting but she sets everything up to make it easy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2014<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: C-</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Lord was a very nice professor with the intention of helping her students out.  I have disliked many math professors at DePaul and she is an exception.  Attendance isn't mandatory but we have about 4 quizzes so you want to be in class when you take the quiz and when she hands them out because you can study it for the midterm & final!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2014<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am so glad I am taking acc 102 with her I dropped the class last quarter because my other prof was just awful. She prepares you for all the quizes, goes over h.w that were hard, prepares you well for all Exams. You need to do all hw!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/11/2014<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her lectures & notes are not helpful at all. Accounting should have numbers & real problems. Her's only have wordy explanations. Be prepared to use the book A LOT as your main source if you take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2014<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>I have no idea where these good reviews of Lord are coming from. Her lectures are disorganized and mistaken (the class has corrected her 3 times so far). They are also lackluster in helping us prepare for homework.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2014<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Eva for accounting 101 and 102 and received A's in each. She is by far the best teacher I've had at DePaul!! Eva is very clear and concise in class and she tells you exactly what you need to know in order to do well on quizzes and exams. She breaks down the material very well and is extremely helpful when answering questions. Thanks, Eva!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2014<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Eva Lord is kind, helpful, and professional. Her class was a delight. She seems to act with the belief that: you are here to learn accounting, and she is here to teach it. There's no point wasting time trying to trick you or get sidetracked by insignificant details. Her class is straightforward and simple. As long as you do the work you'll succeed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2014<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Take her! She truly makes accounting clear and easy. She prepares you for each quiz and her study guides are exactly like the test.

Don't miss out and get get stuck on a wait list. She is great, very clear, helpful and will get you ready for exams and quizzes. 102 is a lot easier than 101 if you read the book, and do her hw u should get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2014<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Eva Lord is a fantastic professor! She really takes every one of her students under her wing, and teaches you accounting so that you understand it. Not your typical "here's the material, good luck" type of professor. I recommend her if you need to take an easy accounting class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2013<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>What can I say all the below comments are accurate. Not only can she teach, but she will help you realize the relationship between accounting and how it factors into the real world without you even having to try, she makes it that easy and clearly. On wait list I hope I get in for 102.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2013<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the prof is really great! I highly recommend her! All acc classes have the same standard 75% is midterm(35%)and final(40%) the rest consist of quizzes, hw.

I've taken it 2x and failed each time, but this teacher was born to teach accounting. She explains things so clearly and gives tons of examples to make sure you understand the material. I honestly don't know what I would have done without her. AMAZING TEACHER</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2013<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are taking accounting 101, TAKE HER! amazing teacher.

She does a great job of pinpointing the main objectives of the chapter in the notes. I bombed the midterm because I had trouble understanding the multiple choice questions, and went to her for help. She taught me a new way of analyzing the problems. I ended up getting a 95 on her final</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2013<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Lord is amazingggg.
