Two midterms, one final. As long as you get the concept right, but numbers wrong, he'll give you credit for it. He curves big time. He assigns homework, but never collects it.

He assigns weekly homework and will give you extra credit if you go up to the board and discuss a problem.  Midterm and Final both worth 50%each.  Exams are very lengthy, but you get to use open notes and books. Understand the homework  and examples in book and you will do well.</div></div></div></body></html>
