My Discover class was the most difficult class, but soo worth it. There was a lot of reading, we were doing some pretty intense essay writing and mandatory volunteering as well. However, I got so much out of the class. I would take any class with him again in a  heartbeat. He is so smart and passionate. TAKE HIM.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2013<br>Class Name: SOC212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor S is very passionate about this area of sociology. There is no papers during the quarter but this is a service learning class. You are required to do 20 hours of service learning. The tests are not easy, you have to study! the final is comulative, so study and take good notes. Other than that, he is a chill and laid back professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2013<br>Class Name: SOC212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the best class I've taken at DePaul.   He is incredibly enthusiastic about what he's teaching and clearly has real world experience.  He truly wants to make you a better citizen by learning essential things about the world.  The tests were not easy by any means but study and you'll be fine.   I would highly recommend this professor!</div></div></div></body></html>
