Prof Lall sits atop his soap box and likes hearing himself talk.  His examples are good but the pace of material is too fast for my liking.  4 chapters/week, plus articles and weekly project portions are due.  I didn't retain or learn much, other than how to regurgitate. Worst class I've taken undergrad/grad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2014<br>Class Name: MKT535<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Grading was somewhat erratic and expectations for success were unclear. Class seemed like a rehash of MKT 555 but with a leadership component that felt forced. Final group project required a LOT of work and I don't feel like I learned much.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2013<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class as a summer session. The pace was brisk, but not relentless. Professor Lall has great examples and explains concepts well. To be successful in this class, be prepared to keep pace with all of his weekly assignments - you'll have a better final project (and be more well-rested) come the 10th week of class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2013<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Lall clearly takes pride in his preparation and delivery of the material presented in this class.  The marketing plan project is time consuming; it is critical to stay on top of the assigned sections weekly and not get behind.  If you don't mind the work, it's a good Class, take it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2013<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An average instructor.   Considering that this was a marketing class he was pretty uninspiring and the powerpoint presentation boring. The marketing plan requires a lot of work but was an excellent tool for learning and reinforcing concepts learned in class. He did a good job developing this activity.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2013<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Lall was a great teacher. He knew the material and had relevant experience. Class participation is key so speak up. He's a fair grader. The exams aren't bad if you study. Stay on top of the final paper and you'll get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2012<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good instructor.

Prof. Lall made the class even more interesting with real life examples. Overall the class has a lot of text book reading and case studies. The marketing plan is very time consuming, but at the same time you will learn a lot from  writing the whole plan.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2011<br>Class Name: MKT535<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is a healthy amount of Leadership that is taught in this class which I did not expect. This isn't a bad thing necessarily but it was somewhat interesting to see a Marketing class add in Leadership this way. Consequently, the class feels a bit disjointed b/c of this. The material is straight forward and lecture/presentation driven.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/02/2011<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Smart prof, but creativity is not rewarded in marketing plan or on the tests. Take detailed notes to prepare for tests and make sure your marketing plan is decent in content and formatted correctly (points deducted for single-spacing, no table of contents, budget not in exec summary etc). If you do that, you should be able to walk out with a B+/A-</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/09/2011<br>Class Name: MKT535<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While Professor Lall is passionate about Marketing, he is less effective as a teacher.  There is a TON of work for this class, but it almost seems like busy work.  Meaning, after all the work you put it, you don't feel like you learned much or mastered the subject matter.  Nothing in this class make you truly assess and apply the concepts.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2011<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is clearly passionate about the topic.  Uses multiple real life examples as references.  Marketing project requires some time but is doable.  If you take good notes during the lectures, you may be able to forego the textbook.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2010<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor. He nows the topic and has plenty of real world experience. The marketing plan assignment takes a lot of time, so start early and work on it every week. However, it is probably the most valuable assignement I've had to date. I would take his class again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2010<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He explains with clarity and provides many examples during the classes. The best way to do well for the exams is to cover in the book only topics discussed in the class plus studying his slides. Midterm and final exams are a multiple-choice test plus some essays. The most challenging part is to prepare a marketing plan on an business idea you have.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2010<br>Class Name: MRKT555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher.  Grade consists of Midterm, Final, Class Participation and Marketing Plan Project.  Class participation is important and its important to show up prepared to class.  Tests are somewhat difficult with 25 multiple choice and 5 essays but he is pretty lenient in grading essays.  Project is time consuming and its important to plan ahead.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2010<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor.

Passionate about the subject.  Very thoughtful in responding to students as to not make them feel stupid about their answer during class participation.  Text book is great for deciphering class notes, however test questions are straight from lecture.  Start paper asap, otherwise it's overwhelming.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/21/2009<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At first I wasn't too sure about spending 6 hours a week on Marketing, but he lets us out early.  Make sure to speak up! and don't wait til the last minute for the research paper.

If you have to spend 3 hrs a week with him, this is the guy to do it with.  He is knowledgeable and his lectures are enjoyable.  Be sure to take good notes as the readings are helpful but not really required.  Also, start the project early - don't delay.  Great class, wish all teachers were this good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2009<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Lall is a wonderful teacher. He really knows his stuff and likes to bring real world examples to his discussions. Pay attention i class, take a lot of careful notes and you'll do fine on th exams.

He is extremely knowledgeable and gives great real world examples. There is a LOT of reading, but the tests really only cover his lectures. You'll do fine as long as you go to lectures and then use the book as a study aid, if needed. The marketing plan is challenging- start early.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2009<br>Class Name: MKT525<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good professor!

Midterm and final are easy, but do test your knowledge.  Marketing plan project is challenging.  You are graded on in-class participation (very difficult to get full credit).  It's very hard to keep up with reading and marketing plan assignments.  I recommend his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2009<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall a good professor.  The book is useful as a reference tool.  Make sure that you take good notes.  Exams are reasonable.  Definitely keep up with the marketing plan--he outlines where you should be after each week.

Professor Lall has passion for marketing and makes it interesting for the class. Class participation is huge, so the Wrigley girl, Sara Lee, and myself contributed to the class.

It seems that he's letting personal problems affect his lectures, resulting in a condescending remark to a student when asked to repeat a concept.  Needless to say, the mood was one of uneasiness for the remainder of class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2008<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor with tons of passion for the theory of Marketing.  I think he did an excellent job fending off three complete morons in the class (The Sara-Lee, the Wrigley girl, & the Dentist).

It is everything you could hope for in a grad class with the difficulty. Mid-term and final were both 5 question essay types. The project goes through the whole quarter and very challenging.

The issue I found with class is that TOO MUCH work is assigned for what is tested on.  DON'T focus on the book.  Go to class and focus on what he lectures on the most.

Had a night class got out early every week, but it was pretty boring overall, just going over slides is not to exciting. Doesn't know how to motivate a class. The two tests are a little challenging, it is pretty indepth, but overall a very good class in which you  will learn the basics of marketing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2005<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very energetic, skilled prof.  His lectures are interesting and very worthwhile.  Take good notes and you'll be fine on the final.  Text was worthless, but if you take good notes you'll never need to open it.  Marketing plan project was very worthwhile.  Prof Lall has good industry experience from his own mkt practice too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice!
