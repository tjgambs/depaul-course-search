There are assignments you have the ability to complete at your own will but it can pile up very easily. The final is the same. He is a well-mannered, funny professor who tends to stray off subject (in a good way), though that fun atmosphere is a bit deceptive when finals come along.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2011<br>Class Name: REL110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Smith is awesome! He makes this class really fun and interesting. If you pay attention and go to class you will get a good grad.  Just make sure to go above and beyond what he asks for focus questions. Overall great teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2011<br>Class Name: REL110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rev. Smith is amazing. He's hilarious and even though its religion u will NEVER be bored in class. He often gets totally off subject and makes class fun. Hes a tough grader and don't take BS from students. Doing 2-3 pages will get u a C at most. Doing 5-6 ensures an A. Remember that and attend class and u will have an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2011<br>Class Name: REL110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice guy, extremely funny and understanding. Often gets way of subject but it makes the class fun! U get the assignments for class at the 1st day of the semester and choose when to do them yourself. In order to get an A take the &quot;required&quot; number of pagers typed and double it. If you follow this rule it will be impossible NOT to get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/29/2011<br>Class Name: REL110<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a great/funny teacher. He definitely showed interest to the class and the students. But he was a hard grader. When he ask for 3-4 pages of work, he means 5-7. So remember that.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2011<br>Class Name: REL110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Reverend Smith is awesome.  He's got a great sense of humor and cracks jokes all the time.  He's a tough grader, when he says he wants two pages, he really means 3-4. Remember that and you'll get an A.  Easy class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2011<br>Class Name: REL110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is super nice and the books are very interesting and insightful. I'm not a bi reader at all but I enjoy readin for this class. Rev. Smith is super chill and makes his lectures interesting by relating them back to students. He's kindof a tough grader but participate and you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2011<br>Class Name: REL110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>MY FAVORITE PROFESSOR!!!. I dont understand all of those negative comments. yes you have to spend time to do all of the hw and yes you do need to study. But he makes his class really interesting! attendance is mandatory but he goes over the previous material at the beginning of each class. read do ur hw and you'll be in good shape :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2011<br>Class Name: REL120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher, makes learning about the bible fun. He is very knowledgable and all in all a great guy! I would definitely recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2011<br>Class Name: REL233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's awesome! I am already interested in religious studies, but he makes it so interesting! Almost like a stand-up routine! Very easy class to follow! I actually look forward to going to his class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2010<br>Class Name: CTH110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher overall. I did so-so on the questions that are mandatory which make up almost half the grade, did really well on the final and other component we had to do in class and got an A. super easy, class is mandatory and can get kind of boring he goes over what he did the previous class at the beginning of class. Overall pretty good teachersj</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/11/2010<br>Class Name: REL380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Going to class is mandatory to keep up with the information provided and discussed. As long as you do the reading (also extremely important, as the class was designed as a seminar - not lecture), attend class, participate in discussions, and complete the assignments, it will be an easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2010<br>Class Name: CTH190<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You are only allowed to miss one class, however he usually spends the first half of class going over the exact same material from the week before.  If you can put up with being bored, however, its an easy class to take.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2010<br>Class Name: REL233<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher was pretty straight forward and the quarterly assignments were easy. I think you can choose 4 out of 10 weeks to do the assignments. However, what no one mentioned is about the absurd final that was cumulative and 38% of your grade. I received all A's till the final. Overall good teacher just do not underestimate his final and STUDY!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/29/2009<br>Class Name: NEWTE109<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very straight forward and explains everything on the first day.   I admit I was nervous reading his syllabus because it looked like a book HOWEVER! assignments were really easy and barely took a lot of time. You pick the days you want to hand them in! Exam was pretty easy and if he likes you and your on the border he'll bump u up :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2009<br>Class Name: REL190<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I must admit at first the class seems to be scary but overall it is a pretty good class. I didn't know squat about the Bible but he really made it clear. The final is not bad because all you need to do is memorize the terms which you use on the essay part of final (which he gives you ahead of time).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2009<br>Class Name: REL223<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ehhh.. not so good. I thought his class was ridiculously boring and hard. He's one of those professors that doesn't seem to think you have other classes to worry about. I guess if religion really interests you, you will like him. I personally wasn't impressed by him or his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2009<br>Class Name: REL190<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>EASY CLASS! HE GIVES YOU ALL HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS FOR WHOLE YEAR ON FIRST DAY OF CLASS SO YOU CAN GET IT ALL DONE WITHIN FIRST WEEK IF YOU REALLY WANTED. NO TESTS OR MIDTERM. FINAL IS NOT HORRIBLE IF YOU STUDY. LECTURES GET WAY OFF COURSE AND OFTEN TIMES DO NOT COVER WHAT NEEDS TO BE COVERED. DEF RECOMMEND THOUGH. CANNOT MISS MORE THAN 3 CLASSES.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2009<br>Class Name: RELNEWT<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Smith is a really funny and nice guy but he really lets the class discussions get off track- which is a pet peeve of mine.  There is a decent work load but its not unmanagable.  You won't regret taking him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2009<br>Class Name: REL190<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bad teacher. I still dont understand what the new testament is all about. Final was not fair.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2009<br>Class Name: REL190<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The only thing that makes this class difficult is DePaul itself. DePaul needs to make it mandatory for you to take some sort of New Testament class before you take this class or you'll feel overwhelmed. Rev Smith makes it fun and practical. His final is tough if you don't study. If you have no memorization skills whatsover, drop the class. No joke.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2009<br>Class Name: REL233<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The final exam was ridiculous. Lecture are off-topic, random,etc.Ideas that your ?required to know? for the final are quickly glossed over in class. He?ll compensate for this by giving a final study guide but that?s even more confusing and misleading. It wasn?t fill in the blank but rather detailed questions concerning ?lecture topics?.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2009<br>Class Name: REL233<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Attendance is mandatory, 8 papers due for class and final sucks you have to know 3 essays  then he chooses 1 at the time of the final. Also 40 definitions plus one of 2 passages by memory and write them out in a blue book. too much stuff for a GP rel requirement.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2009<br>Class Name: REL233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor, very intelligent in religion. Very clear on what he wants. Has a 20 pages sylabus outlining every class. Good teacher for an upper level religion. Study for the tests though, they can be difficult, it's all from memory.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2009<br>Class Name: REL233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Takes attendance every class. Final isnt too bad... but you NEED to study for it!!!!!! His class can be boring but you get off topic easily. You hvae 6 focus questions that you have to answer sometime before the quarter is over..Lots of reading</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2008<br>Class Name: REL235<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is really cool.  You learn but you also go on tangents during discussion about really interesting stuff.  Movies alot actually.  But as far as course work- he outlines EVERYTHING right upfront.  If you wanted you could do all the homwork within the first few weeks and be done with it. Just don't wait for the last minute. It's a good class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2008<br>Class Name: CTH216<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hes an amazingly laid back teacher. I enjoyed taking his class. It is really easy to get an A if you do the work. He does count attendence but the class isn't really boring. The final isn't as bad as people make it seem. All you have to do is pay attention in class and its really easy to memorize. Homework is easy and you only get 5. Take his class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2008<br>Class Name: REL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i love the way he teaches!! his tests are hard so make sure you take notes...but otherwise he is so caring and loves what hes talking about.  i recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2008<br>Class Name: CTH213<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So, I think I should mention that I (I emphasize this) I got an A.                          Anybody who complains about this teacher doesn't care about class OR learning, but just want the A handed to them. The final was a bit challenging, but honestly, pay attention in class and take notes, and you'll be just fine. :-)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2007<br>Class Name: REL233<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WOW his attendance policy has to go! only can miss 2 days and makes u sign attendance sheet everyday. final was HORRIble i would stay away from him if u can unless u like to memorize everything.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2007<br>Class Name: REL233<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His class consisted of 5 sets of focus questions and 2 field components (2 papers that are 2 pages long). You can turn them in whenever you want. However, his final was impossible. He went psycho!! tons of things to memorize. impossible to get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2007<br>Class Name: CTH213<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really love Rev. Smith.  He is such an intelligent man and has great lectures.  I stopped going to CCD when I was 8, so all this new testament stuff was just so fascinating!  I really wish I could take him again, but I don't need any more religion classes!  Definitely take him, courseload is not bad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2007<br>Class Name: REL102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HIS FINAL EXAM MADE ME WANT TO CRY!

I found that my low homework scores improved for the same amount of work when I starting participating more. Do the reading about every other class period because if you dont, you wont be able to participate. Lets you decide when you want to hand in homework, so you wont be swamped. Do it in your free time. I learned a lot!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2007<br>Class Name: REL235<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher.

Basic teaching style, we didn't get as in-depth as I'd hoped, which isn't bad if you're looking for an easy grade. Goes off on rants, which keep you awake. Good deal of reading but you don't have to do all of it. Pretty easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2006<br>Class Name: REL233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really enjoyed his lectures. He answered every question well. He knew A LOT about the subkect and was never stumped.  He really knows his material.  It's a fun class to take.

Super intelligent, funny, and makes you want to come to class. Makes you responsible by letting you decide when to turn in homework. Builds time management skills in a student. DePaul should use Dr. Smith for the standard in professor hiring. Great!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2006<br>Class Name: REL223<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lectures were fairly interesting, nice guys, and he knows his stuff. He's sort of a picky grader.  I just didn't like him as a professor for some reason.  I would take the class again, just not with him.

His lectures are very clear, and he reviews the material (which helps everyone keep up).  Also, while he does assign many papers, you (the student) are allowed to choose when you will turn them in.
