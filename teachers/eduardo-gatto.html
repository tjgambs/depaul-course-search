However, if you understand calc and would you rather teach yourself then take him. His tests are based on hw questions on mml and are fairly straightforward. Oh and watch out for the chalk!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2012<br>Class Name: MATH260<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If there is something I can say about this teacher, his accent must go. I have been mastering math for throughout all my life even before starting preschool. Math has been one of my most competent subjects but I just was not able to stand his lectures. His Italian accent made it so much harder to make out what he was saying.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2011<br>Class Name: MAT262<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Play the game, it's like chess! And look out for the chalk. Gatto gives people so many chances to get points. If you don't get do well in his class, you're a cheeseburgler and should consider dropping out or switching your major to marketing or communication :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/14/2010<br>Class Name: MAT262<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Gatto is a great professor!  His number 1 concern is that you learn the material.  I would definitely recommend taking a course with him.  If you put in the effort and visit him during office hours you can get a good grade in his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/05/2009<br>Class Name: MAT261<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hilarious! I thought his class was pretty easy. His accent is a little heavy but he did a lot of examples. His grading allowed for a lot of extra credit opportunities.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2009<br>Class Name: MAT152<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Humorous, wants to please the students. He has a bit of an accent, but nothing that's too hard to understand. There are times when he doesn't understand the question, and he tends to make a few mistakes on the board. Easy grader and tends to take things literally (it's pretty amusing).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/08/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>EASY,EXCELLENT TEACHING,ENERGETIC, EXTRA CREDIT,TEST ARE THE REAL EASY, HELPFUL, IF YOU DON'T GET &quot;A&quot; IN HIS CLASS YOU DID DO WHAT HE SAID, IF YOU DON'T GET &quot;B&quot;, THEN YOU DID NOT STUDY....IF YOU FAIL THIS CLASS, CONSIDER SOMETHING CLASS OTHER THAN SCHOOL</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gatto is the man! At first it is hard to understand, but he makes everything easy. I recommend taking him for BMS 125 and 126.

Most people complain about how terrible these classes are and how difficult they are, and he made them interesting and easy to understand! Best math professor ever!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great math teacher to take. homework once a week, three tests, and extra credit. great teacher and very helpful. always willing to give you extra points after test mistakes. take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2008<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gatto is a pretty good teacher. He does have a little bit of an accent but it's not difficult to understand him. He is really nice and approachable. He will help you whenever you need it. If you do poorly on the test you can make up half the points plus he gives extra credit. I would take him again any time!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2008<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First math class I have ever understood / enjoyed.

He allows you to make up missed points and extended his office hours because I couldn't make his original hours. Extremely helpful, and he gives up to 5 extra credit points (out of 100 for the class) for good attendance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2007<br>Class Name: MAT335<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is very difficult, but is structured so that you're pretty much guaranteed a decent grade. Test problems are almost exactly like the homework, and he always has extra credit. You can present problems to make up points on tests and hw. It will be crowded but go to office hours it really helps.He's very laid back, pushes hw deadlines, funny</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2006<br>Class Name: MAT260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His grading policy almost makes it impossible not to get a good grade, especially if you're not lazy. I loved this man's sense of humor. He'll crack a joke out of nowhere and do so with a serious tone, making it even funnier.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2006<br>Class Name: MAT260<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gatto is a pretty cool guy.  He is pretty funny and is helpful.  He doesn't always explain things in the best way, but you get used to it.  It is hard material but he does his best to help with this.  He collects homework so you can get points other than test.  Good Teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2006<br>Class Name: MAT260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a cool prof.  Made a 3 hr night class tolerable and such a great sense of humor.  At the end of the quarter, we said we didn't want to learn any more and he said &quot;ok, I'll teach it next quarter (in 261).&quot; They don't get much cooler.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2006<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was painful to sit in!  I took a night class with him and I had to push myself to stay awake...more than half the class would leave during the break.  Could not understand him through his accent and had an extremely odd and unhelful teaching method. Would not recommend for any calc..made it very difficult to understand. Take someone else</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/03/2006<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.

He's a funny guy, wants you to be interested. 4 15pt tests (60pts possible to get to 50- not bad!) and homework (lowest is dropped).

Seriously, I learned nothing from him, the tutors had to reteach me every lesson.  Im not bad at math either, I just did not like his style of teaching.  Not recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2006<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Teacher!

Don't listen to anyone who tells you he's bad in any way whatsoever.  No one's explained as hard a topic as Calculus to me so well before.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2005<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A little tough to understand but a very nice teacher.  His tests were relatively easy as was the homework.  I rarely showed up to class and easily got an A.  Class is a breeze if you are decient at math.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2005<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's an alright teacher, changes the syllabus so that everyone got a much better grade. he's a Dago so if you have hard times with accents stear clear.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2005<br>Class Name: MAT250251<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love this guy! If he seen the class struggling he did whatever it took to fix the problem. He took time out of his schedule for group study sessions and even gave you extra credit points if you showed up. I wish all my professors were so accommodating, and had such a desire for their students to do well and learn something.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2005<br>Class Name: MAT215<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice professor and wants everyone to do good..if you dont do good on the quizzes or midterm you can make up all of the problems to get the points back. As long as you make up all the problems, you can go into the final with a guaranteed 70...be prepared tho, bc making up the problems can take a lot of time outside of class meeting up with him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2005<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I ve been through his BMS 125 and BMS 126 classes and loved them. I think he is an amazing prof. I don't think that you need to spend any time at the tutoring center, simply read the book and use his notes. In combination you will understand the problems easily. I highly recommend him!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2005<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Be prepared for three things: the funniest analogies EVERR, spending LOTS of time in the tutoring center, and working your a** off to get a good grade.

He teaches you the long way for every problem and makes you do the hw like that but eventually he gives you the shortcut. He is a really nice teacher but sometimes he is confusing. There is no inbetween with him either you love him or hate him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2005<br>Class Name: BMS125126<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Difficult to understand bt writes everything he says on board.
