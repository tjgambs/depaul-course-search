Doesn't do examples in class, you kinda have to teach yourself out of the book.  Open notes tests are awesome, and all in all the class was pretty easy.  Has a cute lisp and says ok a lot!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2006<br>Class Name: PSY342<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Exp Psych- class was structured easily enough.  He tells you exactly what is expected of you and if you show up and do the work you will get an A.  Not the most interesting subject but he tries to keep you intrigued.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/09/2006<br>Class Name: RESEARCHMETHOD<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not the funnest class to take, but it wasn't all that bad.  plus he's cute! lol</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2006<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What can I say about Patterson&#63; He is nice, but gives me the feeling that he just throws things together for lectures (multiple spelling errors, fragmented sentences, incorrect directions, etc.), but other than that, he is really not bad at all. I spoke with him often time after class to be sure I understood his sketchy directions-passed with an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2006<br>Class Name: PSY347<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He means well but isn't the best teacher. He made the material boring and gives a lot of work. He gives extra credit for good attendence and other various assignments. IF SPEECH IMPEDIMENTS BOTHER YOU DON'T TAKE HIM. HE SAYS OK ABOUT 10-15 TIMES A MINUTE (LITERALLY!). Just to let you know he is a grad student.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2006<br>Class Name: PSY340<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy, but disorganized in his teaching of stats II. Tests are tricky..lots of calculations, and he doesn't do example problems in class. I learned everything from the book, not him. Never returned back things on time. Does give open note tests though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2006<br>Class Name: ISPSPORTS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SO FUN! awesome, good and always listens to you, we called him BAD ASS BRIAN!! hes got a cute lil accent too.

Hard tests but provides extra credit and assingments in and out of class.  I fell asleep a few times but its hard to be interesting at all times.  Overall, I would recomend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2005<br>Class Name: SOCIALPSY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is not as bad as others have said. In fact, he is nice and very helpful. True, his lectures may be boring at times. Gives extra credit,and he is flexible with assignments. Does not seem to penalize for late work! Overall, easy professor and willing to help! Not at all an ass!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2005<br>Class Name: PSY347<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is extremely disorganized! If youre a stickler for that, do not take him! He can be nice, but also such as ass. Honestly, I can teach myself better than he can. And, it's true...you do not learn in class. Just try to find someone else, and take him only as your LAST RESORT!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2005<br>Class Name: PSY347<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>People complain too much even when a good thing is kicking them right in the rear end. This guy gives extensions on papers, doesn't take attendance, gives study guides for exams, supplements small 2 page papers for quizzes, and is the nicest guy in the world. He's a grad student, cut him some slack jerks.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2005<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>wow can we say disheartening&#63;&#63; This class was such a let down. not only did we do NOTHING with adventure sports over our week, we learned about**** that is completely pointless and will serve as no benefit to furthering my education. this was a waste of a class and my tuiton. disorganized and gets ****y over time. its a man with PMS..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2005<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There are not even enough words to describe how much hatred I have towards this man.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/20/2005<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok he's a nice guy dont get me wrong but in all honesty, very indecisive and not clear with homework assignments.
