Won an Oscar for Sound FX for Coppola's Dracula, and did some work on Futurama, not to mention a million other films.  Really interesting guy, you learn both art and science of sound, one of the few DC profs who knows his stuff AND how to teach.  By no means perfect, too easy of a grader, somewhat unorganized.  otherwise, great!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2006<br>Class Name: DC215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/23/2006<br>Class Name: SOUNDDESIGN<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>When will Depaul stop hiring duds from &quot;the industry&quot; and start hiring people who are passionate about film&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2005<br>Class Name: DC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy rocks...very interesting..knowledgeable.

Stone is not simply another academic who tries to teach a set curriculum. He is a well established professional in the field of sound design, and aside from learning valuable insights into the sound production of major motion pictures, you'll learn lots of good ProTools tricks. One of the best professors I've had thus fa</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2005<br>Class Name: DC215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>D. Stone basically rocks my world. period. end of story. you will watch and discuss a plethora of movies that he has worked on...especially movies regarding tap dancing...and occasionally gremlins, robots, and arnold schwarzenegger.  you'll probably watch a scene from raiders of the lost ark 14 times in a row. listen for the APPLE CRUNCH! A+++++</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2005<br>Class Name: DC215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>D.Stone is not only my favorite Digital Cinema Professor, but overall my favorite professor thus far at DePaul. He's passionate about his work, and it shows. And ask him about tap dancing, he'll have a lot to say.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2005<br>Class Name: DC215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The man won an OSCAR for Sound!  Yet he's also SO helpful and wants to see every student succeed. The course can feel overwhelming from the reading, but go talk to him and show interest, he'll help you ten-fold.  I'm no good at sound but will definetly take him again.  SUPER GUY!</div></div></div></body></html>
