The class was presented so dryly. The class was nothing more than okay. Optional homework. No quizzes.

This teacher cannot teach. I studied the book for hours and when I didn't understand something, he would refer me to the book, if he said anything at all. If you care about your GPA, avoid this teacher. This is the only class I've ever recieved a D+ in,and I studied ALOT. He's pretty mean and doesn't care about the class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2011<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hands down worst math teacher i have EVER had. Argued with students. Condescending and bizarre.

Just god awful. I have always understood math but this man just ruined it for me. &quot;Quizzes&quot; are huge and don't even go along with the homework.. No matter what, avoid this teacher.

He does not even assign that much homework. If enrolled in his class, read the entire book multiple times and do every homework assignment expecially the ones he does not assign.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2010<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a difficult class with a very difficult professor.  He tends to get defensive and a little condescending when asked a question.  He doesn't grade on a curve and almost everyone in the class was failing.  You really do need to attend class regularly and be disciplined enough to do the homework if you want to get a C- or better.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2010<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If your quiz grade hits rock bottom and ask him for help, he'll only tell you to &quot;do better next time&quot; and &quot;do your homework&quot; without giving any constructive opinions or actual assistance. Aviod him as he's a suicidal bomber for your grade. The only good thing is attendance is not mandatory since attending his lecture or not makes no difference.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2009<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!

I recommend someone else.Graded on 4 exams (he drops one)and the final. If you need to take 126 and there is no else to take, just wait a quarter and take someone else.

I don't know what these two posts below me are talking about.  they are trying to trick you to join the class, because their is always so many open seats in his class.

He is OCD, and often times pulls his hair out during class.  He likes to put down students because he has low self-esteem.  He has never been married and has no kids, and has no life.  STAY AWAY FROM GLENNON.  He plays evil mind games.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2006<br>Class Name: MATH<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is tough, but at least he speaks english. He is clear. As a part time student who also works to pay rent-I will also say-if you think this guy's a jerk, wait til you get a boss!

He breaks things down and makes everything easy to understand.  Tests are just like his notes so you dont have to expect any suprises.  Very effective teacher, one of the better Math teachers at Depaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2004<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible Teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2004<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A real incompetent.
