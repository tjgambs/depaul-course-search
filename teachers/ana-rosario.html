You don't learn anything in the class, it is so disorganized, and not worth your time. It is pointless and she makes you do assignments that you do not get grades back on and they just take up your time instead of actually helping.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2009<br>Class Name: MKT341<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is very knowledgeable of the subject and brings in own professional experience. Provides students with info and resources on professional/networking events. If you read and do your work you will be engaged and enjoy the class discussions. Take this class if you want to learn about new opportunities in the marketing field.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2009<br>Class Name: MKT341<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is very interesting, I learned quite a bit. Just show up to class prepared and you'll be fine. Also, there's a big group project, which you work on throughout the course. Take this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2009<br>Class Name: MKT537<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Does not communicate outside of classroom, except by appointment.  She is a tough grader.  Easy-going teaching style.  I felt she was holding something back and the teaching effort is average.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2008<br>Class Name: MKT341<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>After taking this class- I learned that i did not want to pursue marketing. I would not recommend taking this class for pure interest bc there are probably better professors and more interesting subjects- stay away for an elective!! Not an easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2008<br>Class Name: MKT341<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Rosario is a great teacher! She is very knowledgable and very kind. She requieres participation but it doesnt matter if you are right or wrong, she simply wants to help you learn. She is not the easiest grader but what do you expect&#63; You are in college - you earn what you work for. Show some effort and you'll definately get a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2007<br>Class Name: MKT352<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's not horrible. i don't get these people. you don't know what a horrible teacher is. it's true that she has an accent, but it's not that bad. i was able to understand what she was saying. midterm, final, a group project plus presentation, 2 summaries, and attendance/participation. class is very interesting, new product mgt.. best class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2006<br>Class Name: MKT352<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a horrible teacher.  She grades on favoritisim.  You can't understand what she's saying, I got a C b/c she took off so many participation points for missing one class.  She sucks, don't take her if you want a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2006<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She gives you four cases in which you have to do three, midterm, final, and a final paper as well. the exams were not that bad, the smaller assignments are boring, but the final paper is a little interesting, Overall the class is alright, the biggest two problems would have to be her accent and tendency to hold boring lectures every now and then.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2005<br>Class Name: MKT<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutley horrible teacher.  As much field experience as she has, she is a terrbile communicator!  I was unable to follow her trains of thoughts.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2005<br>Class Name: MKT525<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As someone with career experience in marketing research, I can tell you that she does NOT know what she's talking about when she explains things.  She gives grades almost arbitrarily and never backs down even if you can prove her wrong word-for-word from the book.  Don't take MKT 525 with her- you won't learn anything & you probably won't get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2005<br>Class Name: MKT525<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Grading: 25% for midterm, 25% for homework, 10% for participation, 40% for research project. Fair enough. Nice lady, but does not give you anything you couldn't have read in the book, and even so she is very hard to follow. All the powerpoints are directly from the book,as are the examples. I would not recommend her if u at all care about the class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2005<br>Class Name: MKT320<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She seems to know what she is talking about however she is pretty difficult. I would not take her again. I also had dumb group members and most of the grade is groupwork. So find some smart people to work with. I received a B- but after doing a lot of work to get this grade. Forget about it</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2004<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Rosario has a LOT of personal experience in the field.  To do well in this class YOU MUST participate. Not too much work but she DOES NOT curve tests. If you can settle for a B, she's ok.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2004<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard grader, nobody got an A on the midterm, lots of work, nice lady.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2004<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take this class unless it is the last one. She's rather easy, as far as, homework but she makes no sense. She goes off topic, all of her slides are directly from the book nothing new or helpful. Her accent doesn't help either, unless you speak spanglish get a better professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2004<br>Class Name: MKT<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was hard to follow, and completely arbitrary in grading. I was always in class and got As but somehow ended up with a B in the course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2004<br>Class Name: MKT352<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Couldn't understand anything she was talking about didn't learn one thing.  She won't give you and A unless she likes you.  Don't ever take her if you don't have to.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2003<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ugh... Class was very disorganized, very boring, too much rambling.  She did not help students very much.  I feel that I learned absolutely nothing in this class, everything covered in class was learned in another.  It is almost impossible to get an A.</div></div></div></body></html>
