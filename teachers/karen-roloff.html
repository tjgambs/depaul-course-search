Prof Roloff is pretty cool I dont understand the harsh criticism. She does have a hard appearance but really its not that serious we are in college not grammar school do we really need our hand held. Stop the whining people</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/29/2009<br>Class Name: CMN394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great asset to the internship program and really helped my involvement  and knowledge with the professional world she takes control and really looks over her students and has genuine concern she is a great professor. There were a few short writing assignments but they are a great learning supplement and nothing major.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2009<br>Class Name: CMN314<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Roloff is very intimidating I must admit. Once class begins she is much more laidback while still getting the job done. As far as her rules and regulations, they are the same as would be in the real professional world, which is what we are educating ourselves for, so I really don't see the big deal. She is a great teacher I've learned alo</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2009<br>Class Name: CMNS314<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree Roloff is incredibly old school - with the no food, no drink, and etiquette, but its not hard to follow her rules. She's very straightforward with what she expects. She is very intimidating but the class was super easy, and very interesting. Recommend her as a professor, but outside the classroom stay away - she's not very friendly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2009<br>Class Name: CMN314<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Roloff is old school; no food/drink allowed and wants students to maintain class etiquette. That's as bad as it got- not a big deal. She was helpful, loves the talkers and can smell the slackers. Grade divided into  short journals, paper & presentation. No Exams! 90% of class time was about family com issues. Pretty cool prof.- dont be scared.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2008<br>Class Name: XXXXXX<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As the CMN internship director, her basic purpose is to make your life more difficult. You're already probably working your ass off for free, tack on dealing with her attitude, useless forms, excessive assignments, and making sure you don't offend her or do something out of order and she becomes the most difficult thing about your internship. AVOID</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2008<br>Class Name: CMN394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is one of the best teachers i have ever had! She is hard but she teaches you things that you will actually use in the field. He husband is a God in the Communication's world, learning from her is like learning from him! I advise everybody to take her she may be strict but she is worth it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2008<br>Class Name: CMN394<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have only had her for the internship class. She scared me at first, and still sort of scares me. But shes not that bad. If you treat her with respect and show up on time with your materials, she will be nice and there won't be problems. She does seem to really care about you, if you put effort into your work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2008<br>Class Name: CMN314<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Folks, let me be honest with you, Roloff is a good teacher.  Alot of students have given her bad ratings because she is very up-front on day 1.  After that, her classes are awesome.  The topics are very good AND interesting.  Do your work, show up for class. TAKE HER FAMILY COMMUNICATION class!! NO TESTS and all you do is talk about family issues!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2008<br>Class Name: CMN394<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nothing redeeming or postive to say about this woman.Didn't even have her for an actual class-she just oversaw my internship,but every time we met or even emailed she had an attitude.She was nasty from day 1.The only time she was nice was the last evaluation when she wanted me to rate her performance-and made me sit in her office while I did it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2007<br>Class Name: CMN394<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's amazing that DePaul would tolerate her presence while also denying Finkelstein tenure.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2007<br>Class Name: CMN394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A great teacher and absolutely helpful and caring towards respectful, mature, and hard-working students. Do your work, follow the rules. She has good reason to have an attitude towards slackers and dipshits trying to breeze their way through college. She has helped me gain so many opportunities at DePaul and I know they will pay off in the future.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2007<br>Class Name: CMN394<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm not sure why anyone would take her classes.  She hates people, and she makes this hate obvious every time she speaks.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/21/2006<br>Class Name: CMN313<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is not as bad as she comes off if you take her internship workshop. I've taken 2 internships and one class with her and if you get on her good side she is really cool. Her tests come EXACTLY from the book, standard matching definition type things.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/06/2006<br>Class Name: CMN394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not half as difficult as promised in the workshop. Papers are a joke, discussion board comments are basic but annoying, and the hardest part is actually finding an internship that you like. Be warned: the database is nowhere near current.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2006<br>Class Name: CMN329<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very hard to follow since she uses an ancient teaching method-- straight lecturing at a podium, no powerpoint or anything.  Midterm was impossible to finish in one hour.  Unrealistic expectations and she is very condescending. Oh, and what's on her head anyway&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2006<br>Class Name: CMN329<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doesn't teach the text but expects you to know it well for exams. Class time was a bit tedious. Gave a ridiculous amount of questions for an hour-long exam. Will not let you eat or drink in class.

She is so easy and she is always canceling class. Its better if you get on her good side right at the beginning.  She plays favourites.

Profs Roloff is the worst teacher I have ever had at DePaul.  I've am currently a senior and in my entire academic career I have never met a profs who was so mean and rude.

She truly just wants students to get experience in the field.  I would suggest finding your own internship, but from then on it's smooth sailing.

She uses her classroom as a forum for her politcal views.  Very opinionated, rude, and disrespectful.  She doen't even have a phd.
