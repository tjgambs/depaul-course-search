Very clear and direct.  Teaches practical knowledge about teaching. Very interesting course!  Doctor Malin is AMAZING!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/01/2009<br>Class Name: TL525<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She assigns an excessive amount of work and then provides absolutely no feedback on it.  My final portfolio was hundreds of pages long and took endless hours to complete---and she wrote not a single comment on it.  We can't improve without feedback!!  However, I will say that she has some interesting classroom activity ideas.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2009<br>Class Name: TL414<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>FANTASTIC. Practices what she preaches. Charming, engaging, full of *practical* ideas for real classrooms. Inspiring. Have no idea what my grade will be but don't care - I've learned *loads* and can't wait to get out there and use it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2008<br>Class Name: SEC325<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know where to begin.  This woman is amazing.  She's so funny, sweet, and she actually tries hard to accomodate to everyone in her classroom.  You can tell she's been teaching for 15 years.  She's an inspiration to any pre-service teacher.  If you have to take literacy in content areas, please take her. She will help you so much!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/31/2007<br>Class Name: TL414<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor.  She practices what she preaches.  I learned so many great teaching techniques from her. The final portfolio was a handful, but you work on it class throughout the quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2007<br>Class Name: SEC325<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Takes attendance, but its once a week. Not bad, lots of useful/practical info. But too much busy work. Final portfolio is a lot of work. Shes a good professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/18/2007<br>Class Name: TL414<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher. Very supportive and really gave us knowledge that helped us understand the intention and construction of a lesson. Incredibly clear, engaging, and challenging.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2007<br>Class Name: SEC325<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! Clear! Passionate! Lots of tips, hints, and advice that other education teachers, counselors, and advisors lack! Love her! Fair grader too!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2007<br>Class Name: EDU325<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Learned a lot in this class. Unlike other education classes, where there are hypothetical teaching situations, Malin gives you real tips/strategies on how to manage/conduct a classroom, as well as what to expect when finding a job. She also wants everyone to do well in the class, allowing you to redo assignments until you get them right.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2006<br>Class Name: TL414<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Malin is great, and I feel I learned more in her class (tips, hints, activity ideas) than in any other at DePaul.  She is a great asset to the education program, and I highly recommend taking her classes if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2006<br>Class Name: EDU<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher has a bizarre way of grading.  For some reason DePaul Professors equate low grades with rigorous curriculum.  Its not.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2005<br>Class Name: LST<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Love her!! She practices what she preaches.  Lots of work but worth it.  She is also extremely empathetic when it comes to work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2005<br>Class Name: 414<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher, lots of work though. U can tell that she has lots of teaching experience, often her class can be conducted like a Highschool course (every one has to speak, plans 4 the day on overhead). But very nice and receptive.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2005<br>Class Name: EDUCATION<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Malin was am amazing teacher.
