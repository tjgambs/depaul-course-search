Makes power point slides and gives open book/open notes tests and quizzes. She gives a few unannounced quizzes (although she drops your TWO lowest quiz grades). Take no other stats class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2004<br>Class Name: PSY340<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She did a good job teaching a hard class (Stats II), and she's not even a Ph.D. yet. A little boring at times, but not too difficult. I recommend her over many other DePaul professors I've had.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2003<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is definately the professor you want for Statistics people.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2003<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
