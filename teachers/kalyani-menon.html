Very difficult grader. We had thought-provoking discussions in class but she is overall a very serious professor. I was interested in the general content of the class (conflict and religion, focusing on three religions) but it was hard to get a good grade on the papers, which made the class less enjoyable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2015<br>Class Name: REL305<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Menon is an amazing prof. If you're an REL major, you have to have her. The readings in 305 are dense, but its also a 300-level so that's expected. She will totally help you with ANYTHING if you're struggling or need help synthesizing ideas. Meet with her as much as possible if you can and you can easily get an A! READ ALL THE READINGS!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2014<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Menon has a great syllabus that gives you a large overview of world religions. If you do the readings and participate in class, you'll learn a lot and do well.

This is not a blow-off class. Her paper assignments require critical thinking & effort. The readings are dense, but well-chosen, intriguing, & informative. Participation is key. You will learn so much!

She is very professional and expects a lot of work, but she is more than willing to help you out and the material is very interesting. I highly recommend her as a professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2014<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take this class if you're not willing to put in like three hours of work a week. i like her but this class caused too much stress.

She offers a perspective completely different from what many others could offer. She is interesting to listen to and the material is fascinating. The class is definitely best when people have read and participate because she loves discussion. She is a relatively easy grader as long as she can tell you read.

She's incredibly intelligent, has an incredible amount of knowledge on her subject, and is a very gifted orator. Her lectures were always fascinating. She does have a bit of understated, dark humor which just makes the class that much more enjoyable. I looked forward to this class every week.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2011<br>Class Name: REL260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Menon is a great teacher, you'll definitely learn a lot from her class. However, you need to stay on top of the readings to do well in the class, so if you're not a fan of weekly readings you might want to reconsider taking her. If you're up for the work, I definitely recommend her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2011<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best classes and professors I have ever had. She is so brilliant and  so helpful. TAKE THIS CLASS. It is very hard but so so so so worth it. You have to go to class and YOU HAVE TO READ SHE CHECKS. If you participate, read, and think you will do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2011<br>Class Name: REL260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>REL260 was a great experience. The books were excellent with an interesting take on religious violence. She's super knowledgeable, funny, cute and very engaging. Discussion is encouraged and interesting. No tests, just papers, generally 5-page max. Would definitely recommend, especially as a religion credit for a PSC, ANT or SOC major.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2010<br>Class Name: REL260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher! She is very clear and sometimes she can be strict in doing the readings. Her papers are exactly what we discussed in class. So if you pay attention and show up you will get atleast a B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2010<br>Class Name: REL260<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting class.

But she is pretty awesome and knowledgeable. Makes the class sound scarier than it is. It's three books and three papers. If you're intelligent and contribute to discussions you'll do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2009<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this class. it really opened up my mind and all the material was relevant to the world today and interesting.

She really likes participation and to ensure a good grade you gotta at least throw out some critical thinking questions.  She is HILARIOUS in a very sarcastic, dry humor sorta way.But then again I was always soo interested in the subject matter.Great class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2009<br>Class Name: REL260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she knows her stuff! and she is awesome and loves what she does and is very very helpful if you need help. she admits that she is a hard grader and the class will be difficult but dont get scared off like i almost did, she helps you get through and in the end it really is a GREAT class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2009<br>Class Name: REL260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOME! i loved her. She talks to whole time but she's definately a story tell and she has a sense of humor. Some small easy assignments and a couple papers. Everything she says is interesting.

I was competel fascinated by everything she had to say. She is very thorough and outlines her expectations right away. Yes there is alot of reading but all of it was interesting and you discuss it each class so everything is understood.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2008<br>Class Name: REL278<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you're taking her class to fulfill a gen ed, GET OUT!  There are easier gen eds than hers.  There is a lot of reading .  Some of it is interesting.  The class is based on 3 papers and 10% attendance.  She wants everyone to learn, but if you don't like the subject, don't take the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2008<br>Class Name: REL260<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She isn't easy, gives you a huge amount of reading and some of it is hard to digest. But she tells you this up front, she is crystal clear on all everything and is a very talented teacher. She can be surprisingly funny at times and her knowledge about the subject was incredible. She is still figuring out her teaching still, will be great someday</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/23/2008<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's very knowledgeable, and the grade was based entirely on 3 different papers.

Aside from her frigid personality, she required ridiculous mandatory trips with a peace/religious organization (30hrs! ), grades oddly and inconsistently. She made interesting material uninteresting.

Take good notes, they're all you need for the exams and papers!

Amazing readings. Excellent balance of lecture and discussion. Knows how to keep conversation on track while synthesizing even the most inane comments.

Only take her if you have a good idea on Hinduism. For example, Brahim&#63; Atman&#63; if you have no idea what that means, then don't take her. Only take her if you know a good amount of hinduism.

Shes really not that hard, her tests are very straightfoward, generally vocab identification and 2 essays which she tells you will be on there.

I did not like, however, that she was able to take a subject as interesting as Hinduism and make it dry & boring (especially surprising b/c she is a Hindu herself). I felt she could have offered more personal accounts, or more of a Hindu perspective. She grades pretty tough on papers (B-) but received A's on the tests.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2005<br>Class Name: REL260<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I ignored the mediocre rating for this prof and took her anyway.
