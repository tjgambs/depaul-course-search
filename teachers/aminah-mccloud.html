She is nice, helpful, clear, and above all she's passionate about the subject and she knows what she is talking about. I like Prof. McCloud and I will defiantly take another class with her.

Interesting debates. Knows what she is talking about. However, you need to do at least some of the readings and participate to get on her good side. Her quizzes are easyy and short and there are not many homework assignments except for book reviews. She may be intimidating at first but after about a week you realize she is hilarious</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2008<br>Class Name: REL272<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am not sure how she expects everyone to participate equally when there is only an hour of class and forty people in it. Her expectations are unreasonable and she constantly contradicts herself. Every question that is asked of her is answered with yet another indecipherable question. I do NOT recommend McCloud-she's nice and brilliant but crazy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2008<br>Class Name: RELMIDE<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was really unorganized and mostly put us into groups to talk  when she didn't have a lecture prepared. It's pretty hard to get a bad grade in here, and she had some interesting things to say. I just wish she had things a little more together and the class time was used more carefully.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2008<br>Class Name: REL250<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>McCloud is out of control. She is a real professor. She makes you think before you speak, challenges what you say, and in the end you really have learned something. If you didn't blow off the class that is. if you're lazy, pick another class. She is a wonderful wonderful professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2008<br>Class Name: RELIWS<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>McCloud's classes are always interesting, thought-provoking, and her challenges shake you to the core. Make sure you read and are well-prepared to always engage in a lively discussion, as she does pick randomly in class. She can be a little crazy sometimes - very moody, but she's just overworked. Just do the work and she'll love you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/14/2008<br>Class Name: IWSSECT<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr McCloud is easy. I don't know why people think shes hard. You just have to read a lot and participate a lot. Her class is so interesting. Everyone always gets in a big debate. She is SMART and appears to be strict, but she's a total sweetheart. Take her classes if you want to learn because that you'll do O yea, it's impossible to prove her wrong</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2007<br>Class Name: RELIWS<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I learned a lot from her class but I had to put in a lot of time. Her grading is rather schitzophrenic. I loved class discussions though. She forces students to really think about every statement they make and to question everything. Just show some interest and do the reading and you should be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2006<br>Class Name: REL266<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she was alright. i really struggled through this class... and she wasn't very helpful. kind of flexible with deadlines. she can come off as very intimidating, but when you get to know her, you realize it's just a facade. show up to class and participate. if you don't like participating-- this is NOT your class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/21/2006<br>Class Name: IWS100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take this class if you want to increase your IQ.

She is very hard and its difficult to discern what she wants exactly. Quizzes and tests are very hard and more than anything else she wants you to memorize what she says.

She gives so many notes but in the end only some of them are helpful. There is not much work to do. So if you are lazy you should definetely go for her class. She also doesn't start class on time.

The whole class gets involved in discussions, she gives you 4 excused absences!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2004<br>Class Name: REL205<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really cool, but doesn't know what she is talking about. I am a pretty decent student, but getting a good in this class is hard. She is very unclear about what she wants on tests. Participation is crucial to this class-20% of your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2004<br>Class Name: REL272<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You cant quite tell if she pepared what she was going to say in class or is coming up with it off the top of her head. She wants HER answers on quizes, not what you think. NO essays to be handed in.  She looks at everything from her perspective.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2004<br>Class Name: REL372<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>you have to read the books (at least 3) and write the books' review up to 4 pages. A lot of reading required in order to get good grade. She is so picky in grammer more then English techer. She wants a lot of discussion in class.Average grade point is B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2004<br>Class Name: REL272<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her class has a very informal feel to it, even the dumb students feel smart. There is a lot of reading, if u dont read you will suffer, only homework is reading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2004<br>Class Name: REL266<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>unorganized, bad attitude, but shes not that bad of a grader on her papers.....she will only give you an A-, not an A.  We had 3 papers, and I got 3 A-'s.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2004<br>Class Name: RL343<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All this prof did every class was separate the students into discussion groups. That's it. She didn't even seem to have a great grasp on the material. If you repeat the few things she does say in class in your papers, it's an easy A though.</div></div></div></body></html>
