Classes are disscussion based, but interesting. Not the easiest A, but she is not impossible</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I found that some of her assignments were unclear and that she had trouble expressing a point to some of her lectures during class.  She is also a hard grader and grades on improvement.  Overall she is very helpful but it was a stressful class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2006<br>Class Name: ENGLISH104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her assignments are sometimes hard to understand but she is a really nice teacher. She is always willing to help the students. The research paper is hard but once you have a topic its not that bad. Overall, I learned a lot and enjoyed the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This 'professor' is absolutely ridiculous when it comes to grading (very tuff). If it were up to me, she wouldn't be teaching at any university. She's just not professor material. Ex. Sometimes I would find myself sitting in class watching everyone around me looking at each other wondering what to do, after she assigned an in-class project. BAD!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Millie is a cool chick.. yes her assignments are confusing but she is always willing to help. I had no idea what to write about but she is understanding and knows what its like to be a college student.. She even told me my frosh year was the year I was allowed to mess up. A little challenging but over all you'll grow to love her...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this class is very boring. She lectures about pointless stuff that has nothing to do with what you will be writing your final paper on. I would not take another class with her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Millie pushes her students to think beyond what should be expected, which leaves lots of students lost.  Homework assignments are unclear and she is a tough grader on papers.  Class is very laid back and boring.  I would not take her again as a teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Millie is young and easy to talk to. She just started as a prof. and relates to the students a lot. Class focuses on race in the media. Small homework assignments, lots of participation points. One big paper is the focus of the entire quarter. Take her class if you want a laid back atmosphere.</div></div></div></body></html>
