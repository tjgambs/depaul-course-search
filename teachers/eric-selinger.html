He doesn't simply lecture & his classes are mostly discussion based. He's very witty and approachable and he makes the assignments interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2014<br>Class Name: SEC311<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Selinger is such a rare combination of astounding intelligence and genuine compassion that you won't find in a lot of profs. He's not only engaging and challenging as a teacher, but he's so kind, approachable, and understanding toward students. I don't think he'll be teaching this class again but definitely take him if you get the chance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2013<br>Class Name: ENG232<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have so many wonderful things to say about him. I've taken him 3 times and he never disappoints. He's understanding if you're not much of a talker and he's extremely flexible. Just 2-3 short papers and weekly casual response papers. He's one of the greatest gems DePaul has to offer. Not to mention, he's adorable. Take him, and take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2013<br>Class Name: ENG232<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Personally I found this guy super annoying... he is the toughest grader EVER.

There is a lot of reading to be done but if you're clever you can get away with reading little to none. His syllabus is intimidating, but he does not enforce it. He is NOT strict on attendance and will not call on you either. There are 3 papers your have to write, no midterm or final. Take the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2012<br>Class Name: ENG232<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take this professor if you can!

He's pretty funny and tries to make the books enjoyable as possible. They really aren't that bad! You have to do reading responses and a few papers so there's a lot of reading but I really didn't mind!

He makes material so accessable, though, I'd recommend his classes to anyone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/23/2011<br>Class Name: ENG286<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His Popular Romance Novel class was great!

I would take him any chance I got. Oh, and if it's warm outside, he'll usually take the class to sit out on the lawn. Awesome.

Kind, intelligent, funny, cute and interesting.  There were days I came to his class in absolutely no mood to think, read or learn.  I would come out laughing and smiling.  Though he's obviously well educated, he makes poetry more accessible to the everyday student by focusing on the types of pleasure it provides.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2009<br>Class Name: LIT100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVED HIM! 1 of the best profs i've had! his romance class was so fun, rarely skipped cuz i really enjoyed it! loves what he does and is good at it. makes topics relatable, light, and interesting. was a LOT of reading but most of the books read quick and i skipped a few, still got an A. grade is a just few short papers on the books.

The teacher is funny, easy-going and enjoyable.  If you were interested in Romance lit you'll see it in complete new light as very legitimate form of literature.  Only 2 papers, couple quizzes...So take it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2008<br>Class Name: ENG286<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Professor Selinger for Topics in Popular Literature: Romance Fiction.

Easy grader but without being laissez-faire (tha tis, many easy graders are easy b/c they suck--not so here). He is BRILLIANT. Before this I was sort of &quot;eh&quot; about poetry, as previous poster said, now I am inspired to teach it (and other things) so I can have the effect on my students that Dr. Selinger had on me. Awesome.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2007<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he just rocks, basically.  I always liked poetry but now im seriously considering going to school to teach it so i can have the effect on kids that he had on me.
