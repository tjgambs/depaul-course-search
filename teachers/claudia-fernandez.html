She is a really great Spanish teacher, very approachable, very helpful, and made class interesting. I would definitely recommend her classes. She gave more homework than I would expect for a 200 level class, but either way, I still learned a great amount of new knowledge that has me absolutely in love with Spanish!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2009<br>Class Name: SPN242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice! Great teacher! She's a native speaker and knows her subject inside out. You will need to study for her tests but everything from hw to projects to participation is important. I didnt do too well on tests but got an A!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/12/2006<br>Class Name: SPN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Claudia for SPN 102,103. She's a great teacher and good at explaining things you don't quite understand. She's helpful outside of class. If you study for the tests you'll do fine and you MUST keep up with the homework or else it will build up and be overwhelming. We work with the book EVERYDAY, page by page, which can be helpful but boring..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2006<br>Class Name: SPN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very friendly. spanish as her first language so she sometimes has difficulty explaining. Makes you feel really comfortable speaking spanish in class. tests were hard. you will need to study for them</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2005<br>Class Name: SPN352<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Claudia is the WORST teacher for this subject.  she has no clue how to teach phonics and always makes mistakes on the board, then expects you not to make them on tests.Didn't give us a study guide after she said she would b/c she didin't have time and doesn't always have everything up for the tests on time.DO NOT TAKE HER FOR THIS CLASS!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2005<br>Class Name: 352<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Caudia! She was a great teacher. Although the subject was dry, she had a good sense of humor and made learning fun. She was always available for after class help and she truly wanted her students to succeed. Alot of work, but worth it in the end!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2005<br>Class Name: SPAN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She might not be the coolest teacher nor the nicest, and her class might not be as entertaining, but she surely knows what she's doing. If you really want to learn Spanish and say something more than hola amigo, take her. You can be assured that you will learn a lot in her class. After all, this is what you are paying for: learning.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/26/2005<br>Class Name: SPN101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She knows how to come off as cool, but is really a phony.Alot of kids at DePaul will probably like taking her.However,if u do not appreciate people who are two faced then do not choose her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2005<br>Class Name: ART103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Aww, Claudia is totally nice. She is, however, not tolerant of those dippy yuppie fools who insist on sitting in the back of the classroom talking while she's trying to teach. A+ prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2005<br>Class Name: SPN101102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is great!!! She is very thorough and very helpful. She may not be great for the upper levels but she is awesome for introductory courses. She even reviews for the final exam!!! You don't have to do the majority of the workbook pages and is very lenient. Just come to class. You don't even have to stay awake. Just don't be a class clown.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2005<br>Class Name: SPN206AND352<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really cool and down to earth teacher.  She does give a lot of homework but she is willing to help you outside of class if you need the help.  Also, shes hot :-D</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2005<br>Class Name: SPN102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is very unclear in her directions, her tests aren't that hard if you study a little, but her class is so BOring, as well as herself!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2005<br>Class Name: SPN101AND102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved having Claudia as a teacher, and I'm upset that I can't take 103 with her.  She is very well educated, her tests are EASY, and she has a fun personality.  I completely disagree with the negative comments posted up here.  She does expect you to work, but she is lenient in grading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2005<br>Class Name: 206<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Well educated but personality is fake and overated</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2005<br>Class Name: SPN206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Claudia is one of the nicest people you can ever meet. She is cool to talk to and is very helpful. I truly do not understand why there are people hating on her. She is an awesome teacher. Take her class, you won't regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2005<br>Class Name: SNP206<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2005<br>Class Name: SPN206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the best spanish teacher I have had, she is very clear and helping to everyone.  Her tests are not hard at all, they are very easy if you just pay little or no attention.....that does sound bad but she goes through everything very well......highly recommended!!!!! Not that bad to look. NICE!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2005<br>Class Name: SPN<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>horrible professor.

Take Claudia for 205 or 206 she is awesome. Her spanish is clear and sophisticated. If you just do your work and pay attention you should do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2005<br>Class Name: SPN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the greatest spanish teacher ever.  i would never have learned a lick of espanol without her.  yo quiero claudia!</div></div></div></body></html>
