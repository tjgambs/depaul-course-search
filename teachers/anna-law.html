She kept the class up and interested mostly every class. She's a pretty tough grader and you really have to read to do well in the class. She's a smart lady and will teach you a lot while having a pretty enjoyable time in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2011<br>Class Name: PSC263<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Law can be very funny she makes a lot of jokes, she swears a lot sometimes, she's very well-humored. She REALLY makes points over and over. Let's people share their opinion. Pretty good about seeing both sides-liberal/otherwise. Good teacher, makes up statistics on the spot though. Can't always believe them. Decent class not too difficult</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2011<br>Class Name: PSC260<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love her! She's a tough grader, but the class is worth it. She's absolutely hilarious and made the material really fascinating. I'd take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2011<br>Class Name: PSC260<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting class but her teaching is very one sided even though she claims to be a moderate. Class encompasses readings from one text and the rest are reading packets. She's makes class fun through her teaching style but her exams are ridiculous and don't reflect what was taught in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/18/2010<br>Class Name: PSC2<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible teacher course was garbage like her teaching.

Would recommend. Only gripe is her bathroom policy which at the time I had a legit reason to use the bathroom but she wouldn't hear it... ( 7 mos pregnant). Other than that she's great</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2010<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Never read anthing in the text book, took good notes and got a B plus.  She is not the friendliest teacher, and doesn't email you back when you ask her questions, but knows her material and is there to do nothing but teach.  Good class to take early morning all business.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/25/2009<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. She made a pretty boring subject (the fundementals of american politics) much more interesting. She was funny, class went fast. She grades hard, studied a lot and still only got an A-. If you want an easy A this isn't the teacher but if your ready to try and want to learn definately take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/03/2009<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best political science professors at DePaul.  Very knowledgeable and understands her subject very well. Shes very humorous and also really helpful.  I recommend you take her as a professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2009<br>Class Name: PSC260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You can learn a lot from her classes.You can only miss two classes,one paper,midterm and final.She expects well written papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2009<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You will learn a lot! But she is a hard grader... I studied long hours but still didn't get an A.

I went to every class, took tons of notes, did all the reading and STILL didn't get an A! She plays favorites and even if you participate a ton she still may not like you. She is the hardest PSC professor I've had at DePaul and I've had them all!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2009<br>Class Name: PSC260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very good class, learned a lot and had a good time along the way.  She is very well educated and funny so it is easy to stay interested. Not the easiest grader, and with only 1 paper, midterm and final, you don't want to mess up.  Make sure you're there every class and don't leave or she'll kick you out.  Fascinating topic and a great teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2008<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She definately likes to use humor when teaching. Her class is pretty simple, but you learn a lot. She's open to questions. There's only midterm, paper, and final. The reading is easy. Attendence is her only big pet peeve.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2008<br>Class Name: PSC000<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had her for a bunch of classes. She is one of the best prof's at DePaul. Her lectures are never boring because she is so hilarious. Definitely recommend. You have to work to get a good grade since she's not an easy grader, but it's not so bad. She's memorable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2008<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i really enjoyed her because she didnt make me fall asleep in a political science class. loved her. if you listen in class and read you'll do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2008<br>Class Name: AMPOL120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's really funny and down to earth-she's easy to understand and follow. if you show up and listen in class you will do well. This class is a midterm-multiple choice, a final-essay, and one paper. She's funny and a good teacher-i would reccomend her and the class for sure.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2007<br>Class Name: PSC260<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I actually enjoyed both of her classes a great deal. Her tests are straightforward and she expects a lot on paters but if you work hard you'll do fine. She is freindly and funny.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2007<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOME professor! I absolutely loved her class. It almost made me want to switch over to political science. She is SO down to earth and tries to make the class engaging and fun. I barely read the book and did fine in the class. Only one paper and she picks good topics to choose from. Take her!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2007<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i liked her alot. she actually kept me awake and interested at 8:30 in the morning. the tests were kind of hard and there was alot of reading, but overall it wasn't too bad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2006<br>Class Name: AMPOL<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I got a B + in this class.  Missed two classes but did all the readings and still didn't do so hot on the tests.  She makes you remember very insignificant facts from the reading.  Doesn't test if you read, tests how much you can remember.  But on the other hand, I really didn't have to do much work for this class.  So it's a toss up.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2006<br>Class Name: PSC260<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a hard grader</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2006<br>Class Name: PSC260<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Well she was not what i expected, she acts as if she a was bi-polar... she tries to be funny(recycling the same jokes) in class and when you go to talk to her she has this unbelievable frown on her face.  Hard to read her, her lectures were disorganized organized, loves to suprise you with hard material i.e. her final...where the hell did she get t</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: PSC260<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very good professor. In class it was painless learning (aka I didn't pass out sleeping). Law does make her students work for their grades but if you like the law or are interested in it, it should be easy. I would recommend her to anyone cause she was awesome. I would take her again. Don't be scared because you have to work, thats why we're here.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome Professor.

THE FINAL REVIEW IS HALF THE FINAL EXAM. THERE WAS 5 IDENTITY QUESTIONS EACH WORTH 10% OF YOUR FINAL EXAM. THE IDENTITY QUESTIONS ARE NOT IN THE FINAL REVIEW. THE MATERIAL GOES BACK TO THE MIDTERM.

Tons of reading, most of which was unnecessary for the exams. Lectures sometimes lost focus, but Law was an enjoyable and hilarious prof. Very cool course in and of iteself but Law made it fun with minimal to moderate effort required of students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2005<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Decient teacher.

Keeps class as interesting as possible, talks a lot about present day events.  3 tests per quarter which aren't hard if you show up to class.  I never opened any of my books for the class and still got an A, yet I showed up to almost every class.

So bad, that I had to laugh just so she wouldn't feel bad.
