He also is EXTREMELY prepared for lectures, VERY good powerpoints with real-world applications. Very fair grading scale based on the average scores. I would recommend, however it's NOT an easy A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2015<br>Class Name: ECON306<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TAKE HIM! He is really smart at Econ. There are 5 problem sets, 2 midterms, and a final. Please go to each class. It really help. Sometimes he take attendance. He is a very nice guy. Although im not a Econ fan, at least i got a B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2015<br>Class Name: ECO306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Highly suggest going to class, hard to learn the stuff on your own even wit online notes. Attendance is 2% of your grade, 5 problem sets which really help you understand and MUST review solutions for tests. Very helpful and always welcome, even held a super useful review session for MT. Clear and logical lectures, requires algebra skills.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2015<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>I feel he went over the material well. The test were extremely difficult and showed with the class average being a 66 on the midterm. He is an intelligent professor with vast knowledge on the subject. He just expects  a lot with it being a 100 level course.   </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2014<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a good professor, but this class was almost unfairly hard in my honest opinion.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2014<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor knows a lot about world economics and pulls stats out of his head like crazy. However, he jumps around A LOT and each lecture is just a series of short ideas. Very random and does not respond to email.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2013<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The other reviews from 2013 are pretty accurate. He lectured for the full 3 hours and often went past the end of class. He never reviewed the textbook, but that's the only thing that I used. I could have skipped the lectures completely. There's a take-home midterm, in-class final and group paper. Read the textbook. It will help a lot. I got an A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2013<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Woo is very intelligent, but his lectures can often seem scattered.  There is little interaction during lectures so they can seem boring at times.  Mid-term was take-home essays, pretty easy.  Final exam was multiple choice and short answer questions, pretty difficult.  Group project wasn't too bad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2013<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Woo is a really nice guy and obviously very smart...so smart that the majority of his lectures went completely over my head...and everyone else's in the class. He skips around a lot and the handouts never match what he presents in class. Final is impossible...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2013<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jae Joon is a really really nice and intelligent professor. However, his notes are completely disorganized. He always goes on tangents in his lectures. You absolutely can get an A on the take home mid-term if you put in the work. Tough Final. I would not take him again</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2009<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is tough but he's a nice professor. LOTS OF READING. Take home exam requires lots of HOURS cause basically you need to re-read all the articles assigned. LOTS OF reading but you'll definitely LEARN A LOT from him. Tough FINAL :(.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2009<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>overall Prof Woo is a good teacher; he does talk too fast but he makes his class very enjoyable, i've taken classes with other professors at depaul before and some can be quiet boring.  Prof woo's class was easy just try to do good on your midterm since its a take home exam and youll get a decent grade</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/22/2009<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's too fast, He loves to give you mathematical proofs which you don't need to know for your tests, they just confuse you the hell out of you. You have to put extra extra hard work for you to understand the material. His explanation is unclear to me. I understand like 40% from him and i do the 60% alone. But he's welling to help by postponing test</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2009<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Woo is a good teacher overall.  Though many people seem to think he talks too fast, but if you listen you'll understand.  He will always ask you if you need him to explain again.  The exam wasn't hard if you take good notes and study.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2009<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor, learned a lot, but definitely put in many hours studying! He also crams in the material, and jumps around a lot with his handouts. Take good notes and listen, as he'll emphasize what is important. Grades on huge curve -- put effort into midterm, since its take-home and will give you room on the final!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2008<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Speaks very quickly and knows his material - but the final exam was very hard!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2008<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor gives a lot of helpful notes and will help you out on the homework if you need it. However, he crams as much information in as possible (night class) and keeps you the entire time. He goes fast and rambles on and I always left the class feeling confused and having to re-read. Take him, but expect to put extra effort in!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2008<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Woo is a motivated and exciting lecturer. I was happy to see that he filled the 3 hour lecture period. However, his lecture style suffers somewhat from lack of organization and segue from one topic to the next. His quick delivery left me wondering why we were talking about the topic at hand and confused about the material that was covered.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2007<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Woo is one of the better professors at DePaul. He really knows the stuff & is very passionate about the subject. I felt the need to attend every class since he was testing from notes and lectures. Not an easy class but curve is helpful. Study the material otherwise you'll be lost doing class assignments that is 20% of your grade! I got a B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2007<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not the easiest class. Had to read some chapters more than once..and even then I still got a B plus in the class. Professor Woo knows what he is talking about, but it can be very difficult to understand him. I found his lectures to be little help, but all in all he is OK. He curves like crazy, so that helps.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2007<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This prof is passionate about economics and loves to teach it. He's well prepared and knows his stuff. I am not a fan of economics, but I'm glad this is the teacher I had. Be prepared, I think he grades pretty easy on the paper, but the exams are tough! I spent about 12 hours on the take home midterm. He grades fairly though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/29/2007<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took ECO 509 in the spring of 2007.  Although he goes through the lectures at a fast pace, he's a nice guy and a very fair grader (i.e. big curve).  There's one group paper (20%), take-home mid-term (40%) and a difficult-but-apparently-curved final exam(40%).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2007<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Profesor Woo is the BOMB. I took him spring 06 and it was my first econ class. econ is hard to begin with. although he is hard to understand at times, he is a fair grader and curves the crap out of all tests. TAKE HIM</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2007<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Okay, so he's really smart, but kind of hard to understand, he also tries to move the class at a really high pace and often doesn't explain things well, its almost as if he assumes you already know the concepts, definately do the readings before you go to class, or you'll just be really lost! he's erally nice tho and his office is always open!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2006<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Disregard the other reviews on Dr. Woo. Not only is he one of the most knowledgable Econ professor's at DePaul, he structures this course to be both challenging and interesting - to those who want to learn while in grad school. Midterm is take home, written and difficult; like the final.  You will learn exponentially from him and work hard during.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2006<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is kind of hard to understand, but really nice, and he loves it when people come see him in office hours. HW is kid of complicated but he gies everyone a check. the midterm and final are so-so but he curves like crazy. the notes he gives you are super clear and really helpful</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SOOOO Easy.  It is not possible to fail his class.  His practice final is just like the real one and homework assignments are so simple.  He practically gives you the answers to the hw before you hand them in.  Def. take this teacher if you want to pass and put no effort at all in the class, because he curves like crazy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2006<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher. Not hard if you study. Although the topics aren't always the most interesting, he'll help you whenever you ask.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2006<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SUCH a nice guy...he will be there to help you whenever you need it. He graded our midterms with a 9% curve...he wants the class average to be a 83%. Tests aren't very hard if you study....study problem sets!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/20/2006<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Difficult to understand him, class is very boring, all he does is talk and give a hunder examples for the same darn thing.  Exam is obnoxiously long</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2005<br>Class Name: 106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>love this teacher!!!Very helpful!

All he teaches is only &quot;Theory.&quot;  His take home exams was suppose to take 8hours long, but it took us 5 days.  His finals are VERY difficult.  Also, it is hard to understand what the hell he is sayi</div></div></div></body></html>
