Easy A, though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/30/2015<br>Class Name: IS422<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>difficult to understand</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2015<br>Class Name: IS422<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Depends on how well you know systems analysis</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2015<br>Class Name: IS422<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.

The professor taught about Business Strategies and IT Strategies and he literally used to make up IT strategies for companies in the class. I didn't learn anything and it was a complete wast of time and money. He was confused more than half the time and would agree to any strategy you make up about a company.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2013<br>Class Name: IS422<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very clear on requirements. C#t DePaul was worst part for me, however, much weight isn't put on your C# skills as we are all not programmers, nor interested in it.  I highly recommend any MSIS student at DePaul CDM take IS422 with this Professor!  Also, he lets online students come to in class lectures/labs whenever we want.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2013<br>Class Name: IS422<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice guy and an easy prof. This class teaches u about System Implementation and Maintenance but it goes about doing so by making u implement an actual IS. Some C# coding, he will teach u everything u need 2 know 4 the project. He gives u an exam guide for the midterm and also allows 20 cheat sheets. Fast replies to emails. Sense of humor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2012<br>Class Name: IS422<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was extremely helpful any emails sent to him were answered fast.I would take any classes he has to offer in De Paul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2011<br>Class Name: IS421<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher, a little hard to understand sometimes.  Great sense of humor and very kind.

CLass is based on his lectures. And 5 hw assignments that are part of a large project. Final and mid-term are very similar to each other and the practice exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2010<br>Class Name: IS373<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is pretty easy.

He explained the assignments very well and you could e-mail him anytime and he would respond back within 5 minutes! He gives out a lot of extra credit so the class is an easy A. Take him!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2007<br>Class Name: IS373<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Makoto is a very nice, funny, and friendly teacher. The work in the class is pretty average for a college class, and it's all in line with the topic of the class I was taking. We had some guest speakers come in which was highly rewarding as well. Overall, I'd definitely take him again, and recommend him for IS majors - or not.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2006<br>Class Name: ECT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor.  Lays the material in an easy to understand manner.  He is willing to stay after class to help those who are struggling.  He is prompt with email responses.  Fair with grading and homework assignments.  Very organized and teaches well.  I will definitely take a class with him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2005<br>Class Name: IT215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy subject, prof give good lectures although sometimes the lectures were a little confusing and unorganized.We would get some handouts at the beginning of class and at times they wouldn't be discussed at all.He believes in not keeping you too long for lectures so that you don't get bored.His lectures last only 60mins.Very cool professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2005<br>Class Name: IT201IT215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, he knows his stuff.  Just go to class and pay attention, cuz he explains everything very well.  He is extremely helpfuly outside of class and is willing to do extra lab session just to help you out and understand the material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2005<br>Class Name: IT215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Funny professor, good attitude.

The class material was easy though and I breezed through it without paying much attention. I wouldn't call him a good teacher but if you wanna do well, put in a little effort and an A is yours.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2004<br>Class Name: IS375<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing incompetent and has the ability to turn a simple class into a the hardest class I've taken at DePaul.  Avoid this guy like the plague.  He speaks in buzzwords and gives homework outside the scope of the class/prereqs.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2004<br>Class Name: IS63<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class and text are not to analytic, but the guy is great and friendly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2004<br>Class Name: IS371<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2004<br>Class Name: IS370<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really great teacher!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2004<br>Class Name: IS370<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class sucked. It wasn't terrible, but the teacher is very hard to follow. HW does not relate at all to midterm or final, and overall confusing. I really learned NOTHING. Don't take this guy</div></div></div></body></html>
