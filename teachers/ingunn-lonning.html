There are weekly quizzes on d2l, a presentation, midterm, and final. Lonning is a tough grader though, on the tests everything will be marked down that is even somewhat wrong. Gives worksheets handed out in class and we never used the book. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/17/2015<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Lonning was an okay professor during the beginning of the course. She taught clearly and gave good examples. After the midterm, she stopped writing notes and used more powerpoints to give her lecture. She gives alot of practice problems but they are not that helpful for the exams. Midterm and Final were fairly hard. Average. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2015<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dull, dry, and boring. However, it is hard to make economics fun and engaging. The monotone voice does not help and the ruckus outside doesn't help either. Textbook will aid in understanding the concepts if it is not clear in class. Diagrams, graphs, and examples really help in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2015<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>That class itself was super boring, but the professor made it EASY. she explained everything more than once, and made everything clear. Knew what to expect on the midterm and final. Lenient grader. Definitely take.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2014<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a nice lady. ECO 315 can be brutal but she makes it understandable. Class is pretty much all based on mid-term and final, which she graded leniently. She also posts everything on D2L too. I had to drop my last ECO 315 class, she's the best option at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2014<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>STAY AWAY.. not because she is difficult, but because this is literally the most boring class I have ever taken in my life. Lectures are all over the place and you will learn very little in this class. I'm sure there was no one who could have possibly failed this class because it was rather easy, but so boring you want to walk out halfway through.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2013<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Lonning curves A LOT. Without her curve, I would have a D+. She curved me to a B. Her lectures are boring, but study the material before the midterm & final- there are no surprises. Make sure to do the homework- it is a cushion in case you mess up the final, that is 45% of the grade. Lovely lady too!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2013<br>Class Name: ECO103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Well, she may get the most boring teacher in the world award...Besides that and her obnoxious accent, she is average. So average that lackluster performance is to be desired and makes her the worst. Take her for the class, not the professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2012<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doesn't really give homework and classes aren't terrible, but she isn't as clear as she could be. Not awful, but not recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2011<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A little tough to understand her..or to get her to understand you. But what is actually graded is very easy. You may have to work a little harder if you have no knowledge of economics but so easy if you do. Those who didn't know anything about economics liked to challenge her as if she made up these theories herself. So maybe she could have been a little clearer but otherwise pretty okay.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2010<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor appears to be helpful, but she doesn't have a contact number on her syllabus & isn't very sympathetic. Her exams don't seem hard but she'll find anything that might be wrong and take off points. The material isn't difficult, but you better know it better than she does so you can point out poorly written questions. There will be many!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2009<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher was horrible.  Very boring lectures and will actually answer your questions with the same question you asked, but with a higher pitch when she doesn't know the answer... which happens frequently.  Glad my class was reimbursed through work!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2009<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't recommend this professor for ECO 509.  She doesn't explain material well or inform her students well what is on the midterm and final.  I hear Miller is the prof. to take for this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2009<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Expected a lot more from this class than it was.  Professor just read Powerpoint slides all class.  Painstakingly boring and class got off topic easily, but a really easy A.  She takes attendance so you have to go.  Don't Buy The Book!! We never used it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2009<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took her for Eco555.  Nice teach.  Just study and pay attention in class.  Exams can be a bit tricky so know the material inside out.  Mini class papers are easy, just put some effort into it.  Really nice teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2008<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/14/2008<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is based on a mid-term, final, and four HW assignments.  The exams are mostly lecture notes and the book is not really used (maybe two or three questions out of a 40 question exam).  Overall, she?s a fair grader and willing to listen to your complaints about points on exams.  Exams are about 1/3 multiple choice and the 2/3 are short answe</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2008<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very patient & willing to help you learn concept from every angle.  Grade based on midterm, final, and writing/graphing assignments.  Discuss real world events at beginning of class.  Keeps you the full time.</div></div></div></body></html>
