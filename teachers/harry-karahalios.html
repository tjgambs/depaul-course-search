I learned absolutely nothing. I had a hard time trying to figure out what he wanted in his papers. He tells you to do something but never explains how to do it. I do not recommend him at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2004<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher...easy grader...easy to know what he wants you to do and can easily get an A in the class if you attend occasionally and bother to do some of the readings...great teacher...highly recommend</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2004<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Harry is a great teacher, minus his tendancy to be a bit confusing at times, he is very nice person, he has a sense of humor and he is willing to help you whenever he can. ENG 104 is not the best class, but if you have to take it, take it with Harry.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2004<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Harry is an interesting man. A good teacher, but can be very confusing at times. Alot of reading and class discussions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2004<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>awsome teacher, helps you out with anything regarding the papers.  funny and cool, very down to earth!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2004<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>104 is a great class...4 papers are your entire grade.  He is really helpful if you want him to be.  He is always available for help, but i never used that at all.  Pretty easy A, lets you revise all of your papers</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would recommend him. He does give a reading for every class, but they're pretty short and not too hard. Plus he goes over them the next day.  Helpful and fun. He gives 3 papers, but you can revise all of them by the end of the semester.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2004<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Harry assigns very short readings, that actually apply to what you will be doing in your papers!  Only four papers, and one is a breeze so the work isn't too bad.  You also get the chance to revise your papers for a better grade!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2004<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the whole concept of ENG 104 is stupid. but since the class is required, take it with harry.  assignments are easy and if u need help, u just see him in his office hours.  he also allows u to re-do papers for a better grade so his class isnt too bad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2004<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Harry is definatley a confusing teacher, he tells you one thing and then does the other. Writing papers for him is hard because he grades very strictly. He lets you re-do the papers but still will never give you an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2004<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sometimes he'll like your writing, sometimes he won't.
