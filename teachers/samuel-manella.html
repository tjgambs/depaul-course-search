His class is completely based on lecture but he gives great examples to help understand the various laws, etc. Your grade is based off of the midterm (50%) and the final (50%) as well as extra credit case briefs that are turned in at the end of the final. He gives the grade that he thinks you deserve.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/13/2015<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Manella really knows his stuff!

His tests are challenging but that's because law can by a technical, dry thing to read about. He puts emphasis on coming to class and participating in his lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2014<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Manella is honestly a great guy.  He cares about everybody and genuinely wants everybody to grasp the concepts.  I advise you to always attend class because the content is too hard to understand from just reading the book.  His lectures contain real world examples because he's literally a lawyer. Tons of respect for him, take Business law with him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2014<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Manella is one of the coolest professors at DePaul for sure.

Gets out early all the time. Read the book & do the problems. Exams are hard if you only take notes during class without reading the book. 1 mid term, 1 final, do the weekly problems if you want extra credit.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2014<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>really funny teacher but i didn't take any notes in class because hes not really clear about what the actual topic is..gives examples no real def'ns. Kinda hard to study for the class. Briefs are done just to help your grade. great fun teacher though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2014<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took him for Business Law, WISH I took him for MGT 300. The teacher I'm with now is horrible and I'm writing this rating while I'm writing a 5 page "micro manager" report. Take Manella for MGT 300 if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2014<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He taught the entire 1.5 hours only once during the quarter. Expect to get out 15-40 minutes early. Book isn't useful, but necessary for briefs. BUY THE STUDY GUIDE. It is just like the 2 exams. He is an active attorney with great insight.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2014<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely one of my favorite professors ever! His discussions keep you interested the whole time and I love his sense of humor! He relates everything to real life, so nothing seems abstract! Also, if you show interest and if you're active in the class, you WILL get an A even if you don't get As on your midterm and final. He's AMAZING.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2013<br>Class Name: BWL201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: B-</div><div id="right"><div>this professor is my favorite!!!

He doesn't take attendance but he does outline the most important stuff for the tests so you might as well go. Plus he jokes around a lot and lets you out early. The only way you don't get an A or B is if you absolutely don't even try a little. He's really nice and isn't out to screw up people's GPAs. PS Get the study guide.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2013<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. I didn't buy the study guide and I was fine, but thats because I read and took good notes.

He has a lot of life experience to relate to his lectures and incorporates great humor which keeps the class interested. Attendance isn't mandatory, but he keeps an eye on who shows up regularly. It's probably not a good idea to miss lectures anyways because he teaches the important information he pulls from the book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2013<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is the man!

Definitely take him if you can. He is funny and makes class very interesting. I actually looked forward to going to his class. Grade is 50-50 midterm/final.

Grades consist of midterm, final, and a paper due at the end of the quarter.

The class discussions are usually pretty interesting, but he never takes attendance. There is only a midterm and final test, not cumulative. They are all short answer essay questions which sucks, but it isn't hard. Reading the book is helpful but not entirely necessary. What he talks about in class is more important.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2010<br>Class Name: BWL201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Manella is a pretty fun professor. Some of his lectures can get boring but they are very useful in a practical setting. Midterm/final: 50%/50%. Mostly true-false questions.

His examples make no sense when he first says them, but give it a few minutes, and it's crystal clear.  Book use very low, but he did go over a couple of cases from it.  Super easy and entertaining.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2009<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is great. And he's pretty good-looking in that middle-aged-dad kind of way. Everyday is a class discussion with no lectures at all. You will never be tested on  anything that he doesn't mention in class so don't bother getting the book. There's only a midterm, final, and a paper. Guaranteed B+/A- if you pay attention.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2009<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sam is an awesome guy. His classes are fun to go to and really make all of the information you learn applicable to everyday life.

He's so easy to listen to and will stop if he thinks he's being boring. He was lenient on my final paper (didn't fulfill all the requirements) and I still pulled off an A in the class.
