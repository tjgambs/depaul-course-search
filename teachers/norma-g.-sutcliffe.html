If you do all of your assignments and participate you can easily get an A. Homework assignments requires some research. Final was challenging the materials were boring and required reading multiple times to respond appropriately. The mid term paper was brutal as well but overall the class was good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2012<br>Class Name: IS570<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher at DePaul.
