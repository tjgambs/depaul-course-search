The class is movies with some easy assignments on what you watch. The movies are really cool and interesting. Would take again in a heartbeat. He's funny and always makes things interesting!!! Great Class easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2015<br>Class Name: DC110<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Ron is passionate about the material, but he is not well suited to teach students new to the field. I felt lost after each class and didn't know where to find help. He blatantly criticizes the book for being uninformative then tests on large reading assignments which reading doesn't even help with. Nice guy but wouldn't recommend. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2014<br>Class Name: DC227<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A cool professor and very knowledgeable about films and philosophy.

His version of explaining the assignments and "helping" students are like more vague outlines and cryptic remarks.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2013<br>Class Name: DC227<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I learned some much Philosophy through watching movies. Took the class online by viewing the lectures and he's hilarious. Would recommend this class for people that need to fill their philosophy major.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2013<br>Class Name: DC227<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>such a great professor! he's teaches well and is actually pretty hilarious. i'd highly recommend this course and this prof. he's easy to work with and fun to learn from.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2011<br>Class Name: DC227<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Was an ok professor. Was a stickler for deadlines, then fails to have our grades in on time. Is ok with outside help, but don't miss class for any reason except death. He won't help you at all if you miss class. I would take him only as a last resort.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2011<br>Class Name: DC227<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ron was one of the best teachers I have had at DePaul! So relatable,into drugs maybe, and easy on the eyes. He definitely knows how to teach and chooses awesome movies that make you actually WANT to go to class. Im going to miss my class with him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2011<br>Class Name: DC227<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing professor. If you are having issues, he's very open to helping you get through. Don't miss any classes if you can help it, and study for the midterm and you will do fine!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2011<br>Class Name: DC227<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was alright, pretty easy grader for the most part. Don't bother buying the textbook though, you will never use it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2010<br>Class Name: DC310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is really a nice guy and I love talking to him about music but he is basically a useless professor. He gives us little to no time to do important projects then complains that it looks like we put no time into them. Very unprofessional and disorganized. He knows his stuff on Avid but you probably know more about Final Cut than he does.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2008<br>Class Name: DC210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Well, he was ok to look at the first few classes but honestly I could have learned this stuff in  the field. I know this is an important class but sheesh the projects were more hit the ground running.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2007<br>Class Name: DCSECT<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy, poor instructor.  After taking his class I seriously thought about transferring to a different program.  I was never sure what his grading strategy was.  It seems more based on how he feels that day and less about whether you've achieved the goals of the assignment.  No clarity or focus.  Nice guy, poor instructor....</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2006<br>Class Name: DC205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Eltanal is a really wonderful prof.  He's a great guy to have for an intro DC class... very understanding, helpful, etc.  The only thing that annoyed me was that he was a little too agreeable in the class discussions.  I would definitely take him again though!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2005<br>Class Name: DCPRODUCTION1<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great class, learned alot from the lectures. I like how we reviewed each other's work in front of the class.</div></div></div></body></html>
