He's not an easy grader, but if you do your paper and pretend to do the reading and write a couple notes here and there you'll get a B. I didn't do much, just faked it and made it with a B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2015<br>Class Name: INT388<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>This class has much potential to enlighten students on the workings of migration and forced migration. Unfortunately, the presence of McIntyre makes it difficult to learn anything about said topic. The most helpful day we had was our last day, where he was too sick to come to class. If you want to learn about migration, take up an internship.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2010<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher, understands the big picture and won't get caught up in technicalities, but does expect you to work, take him and learn some stuff while expanding your horizons, encourages class discussion based on the reading which wasn't hard at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2009<br>Class Name: INT202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Told GREAT stories in class. Really nice guy, very friendly. I didn't think the class was hard at all as long as you did the reading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2009<br>Class Name: INT202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really awesome guy!

Incredible reading, amount and content. Creative. Made me the best student I could be. Was committed to students who worked hard.  Helped me challenge myself.  Well informed.  Created critical thinkers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2008<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Expects students to put forth a solid effort (out of class events, lots of class discussion needed) but a very reasonable prof, great knowledge of Chicago and politics. Would definitely take one of his classes again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2008<br>Class Name: INT203<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The man can not teach and insists on class participation when he just talks and talks - all on the basis of his own opinions while shooting down the opinions of others. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!Well, well, well, isn't this a nice little &quot;hidden transcript&quot;.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2008<br>Class Name: INT202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's kind of a self-righteous jerk, the prototypical International Studies professor at DePaul.  Yeah he's smart, but he just lectures on his own opinions.  No tests, just extremely and obnoxiously vague paper assignments.  Advice: If you're in International studies now, get out while you still can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2008<br>Class Name: INT202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Guy has a great revolutionary spirit...however lectures were very indepth but rather boring. Loved material, but I hated the structure of the class. Overall pretty decent professor, but I wouldn't put him in head of INT department.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2006<br>Class Name: INT401<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Intelligent and challenging professor. Prepares students well for grad school. I wish there was more time to improve my writing skills based on his helpful critiques. Montains of reading (final week- 1200 pg book), writing, and quiz taking. Quizzes are pointless and hard. Boring class format. Be prepared to present your position papers at any time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2006<br>Class Name: INT202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Classes are alwayd extremely interesting and he is not afraid to tell it like it is.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2006<br>Class Name: INT202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love this guy.

I thought he was extremely intelligent.  This was back in '98 but I can't imagine that he's changed THAT much.

Very intelligent and funny. Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2004<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First you have to read through a six page syllabus to figure out what he wants in a paper, and even then it still doesn't make any sense!! This man explains things in the most vague way imaginable. At least he doesn't seem to care that half the class is sleeping every day... Run.  Run now.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/20/2004<br>Class Name: INT203<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man is a royal pain. Runs the INT department but really has no business doing so. Seemed intelligent but was simultaneously boring and condesending. What a waste of time. A real liability to the INT program.
