She was kind and never and clear. My problem is in with the way in which she ran her class. There is only an emphasis on memorization and regurgitating information. There is no learning aspect to this class. She just wants to make sure that you hold on to EVERY word that comes out of her mouth.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2011<br>Class Name: PSY377<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very, very poor class structure. Deliberate, inordinate focus on minute details makes it all but impossible to retain information beyond exams. Would not recommend this class if it can be avoided. To be fair, professor Virtue does try to help any way she can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2010<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher and easy to talk to. Not too hard to do well in the class if you keep up with readings.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2010<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Virtue is fantastic! Her lectures are very informative, she definitely wants students to do well. She's willing to help however she can, and tries to make 'dry' topics a little more interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2010<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Review sheets were horrible.  She seems to like to teach or fakes it okay.  I think the presentation stuff was a waste of class time.  I wonder what happens if she gets tenured.  Wish I took this class with another professor but it was okay.  It helps if you are a dog lover because she is majorly into her dog baby.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2010<br>Class Name: PSY377<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Virtue is a wonderfully dedicated teacher to her work and especially students. My 2 years at DePaul, she is easily the most memorable and favorite teacher. After graduation, she has continued to help my educational career and has been immensely helpful. Class is tough, but if you make it through, you actually retain the information solid.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2010<br>Class Name: PSY377<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Virtue is one of the best teachers I've ever had in my life! She is dedicated to her work & her students. She deserves ever award out there for effective teaching! Not only is she extremely well read & intelligent, if she doesn't know something she'll research it & get you the answer! Class discussions & topics were great. take the hybrid class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2009<br>Class Name: PSY377<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I ADORE Dr. Virtue! Tough class, it's true, and there are quizzes. But trust me, if not for those quizzes come test time you would be so behind. She is so interesting and enthusiastic about her work and what she teaches. Super sweet, super smart, and probably my favorite professor at DePaul. TAKE HER, but don't plan to slack.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2009<br>Class Name: PSY377<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a brilliant professor.  Her class is interesting and challenging.  Despite her busy schedule she is always available to help.  The tests are hard, but if you read everything you can get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2008<br>Class Name: PSY377<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Professor Virtue! Yes, it's a hard class but she honestly is there to help you. Weekly quizzes but she gives you hints ahead of time. Midterm, Final and Paper also but if you just listen and take good notes you should be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2007<br>Class Name: PSY377<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>probably one of the most difficult psych classes i've even taken. She's a very  nice person and cares that the students do well. but do not take if you plan to slack off because you have to work VERY hard to get a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/07/2007<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best pyschology professors at DePaul. Virtue is extremely helpful and wants her students to suceed. I got sick during the quarter and missed the mid term and she worked with me so that I wouldnt be behind. People who want an easy A, take something else. You need to work!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/30/2007<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great teacher! she's very fun and keeps students interested.  weekly quizzes are not difficult, but some studying is required.  makes the class fun!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/11/2007<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>People! she comes regularly to this site and checks it out. She knows people take her class because its easy. Not any more, she made it so hard. If you don't trust me, take it for yourself! Most of the time she couldn't say words right and couldn't answers student’s questions. Her quizzes and  exams are not easy at all! Most students got Cs in clas</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2007<br>Class Name: PSY377<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She uses powerpoint lectures, yet she is always saying words wrong and using incorrect grammar, and she doesn't even correct herself!  Her review sheets are horrible.  Interesting class, but not that helpful in her teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2007<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very nice, and cheerful, she can't help it shes southern!  She teaches one of the harder intro-psych classes, but its not bad. she outlines everything very clearly. Shes also very knowledgeable and passionate about psych. No surprises in her class. she loves dogs,but also thinks animal testing is a good idea which bothers me. I recommend her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2007<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is one of the nicest people you will ever meet! She cares about her students' progress. She is young, energetic, thorough, & capable of keeping the class's attention despite using powerpoint. The average class has a few jokes, videos, & examples (which you need to take notes on).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2007<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is a very sweet lady. gave weekly multiple choice quizes to test reading but very easy. always trys to keep students interested. I am picky about teachers and i strongly recommend her. Not hard to get a good grade. Just make sure you read and ask questions if you have them along the way. She is always willing to explain unclear material</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2006<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can't believe there is only one negative comment about this professor.  Although, I agree that she acts very sweet and caring, if you can get past the B.S. you will realize that she is not  a sweet caring person at all.  I really don't have a problem with her teaching but her fake personality makes me want to vomit.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2006<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's one of the sweetest prof i've ever had. she has a strict guideline on the syllabus to follow for all assignments. the lectures are posted on BB to print out ahead of time. she makes lectures interesting with stories and video clips. she LOVES to talk about her dog. she makes psych interesting and relates it to real life. she's worth taking.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2006<br>Class Name: PSY377<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is certainly not a blowoff- but its a nice change to learn something from a PSY prof. She is very clear, helpful and excited about the subject matter. One of the best in the dept. Exams require careful studying, biweekly quizes and a midquarter paper. But- gives plenty of assistance and study guides and tips. Highly rec.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2006<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is awesome :) likes teaching and you can tell she cares about her students. her lectures were interesting, rather than boring. great personality. would definatly take her again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2006<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an excellent teacher, highly recommended. She gives printouts of notes so you can focus on listening to her lectures. She is very clear at what she expects from you and the work is easy for the most part. There were a few problems on the mid-term that were confusing and irrevalent though. Great teacher overall.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The experience was like a nightmare from high school where every teacher was condescending. She was a feminist but an 'easy' one.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2006<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor for intro to psych.

Her lectures were really clear and she kept them really interesting.  It was a fun class and I would recommend it to anyone even if they were only sightly interested in psychology.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2005<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Virtue is such a sweet-heart. Her lectures are VERY interesting! I wouldn't call this class 'an easy A' because you DO have to study for the tests! However, that being said, you learn A LOT. Quizes are every Friday (5pts.), just study your notes from class.  Study Guide for Midterm & Final are VERY helpful. GREAT TEACHER, would recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2005<br>Class Name: PSY377<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best prof. I have had so far. Very very very nice, organized, easy, and helpful. I really love her.This woman is truly a SWEETHEART! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Class was fun and interesting! You will definitely learn and enjoy any of her classes! At the end, I felt like she was more like my friend!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2005<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TAKE HER TAKE HER TAKE HER!!! Professor Virtue is seriously the****! She is soo awesome and her grading system is soo clear cut. She'll let you hand things in late and STILL give you full credit. Easy quizzes and she tells you whats on them! Alot of power point, but makes class soo much fun and interesting!!</div></div></div></body></html>
