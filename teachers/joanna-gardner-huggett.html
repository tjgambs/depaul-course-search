Very knowledgeable, kind, eager to help students learn. Her history classes are interesting, I've taken two. She makes me wish I'd gone for an Art History degree instead of an art degree. Also she's very easy to talk to even for simple conversation. Get to know her, always ask for help, you will do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2013<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Textbook helps. Perfect class to get requirement out. The class is just a powerpoint, she explains slide and you jot down simple notes. The exams are: tell me the name, date, and medium, of the picture on powerpoint. Two easy and short essays.

I learned a lot about contemporary art and she made the material very engaging. Art history is definitely now one of my favorite subjects!

I didn't know anything about modern art going into this class, but her way of teaching it and making it fun made it one of my favorite topics in art history. You do a lot of readings, but she does what she can to make sure you really understand the material. Highly recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2011<br>Class Name: HAA240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The material was a bit difficult for me but she posted the slides for the midterm and final with plenty of time to study.

They are 35 each and they're a bit challenging but if you take good notes on the paintings in class you will do fine and you won't need the book. You can find info of the paintings online or in books. There is one easy quiz, a few short assignments, and a 10 pg paper</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2010<br>Class Name: HAA240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Joanna is super nice and actually makes her lectures engaging.

It's a little bit hard to stay concentrated because everything is on the powerpoints and she talks about the slides. Midterm and Final are 4 slides identifications, and a 6 page paper. Overall not bad at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2009<br>Class Name: ARTHIST<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Compared to other art history classes, hers is not bad at all. You only have to memorize like 20 slides for each final and there's one short paper. You do have to go to the art museum though. Overall she is fairly easy, and doesn't grade too harsh. I recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/18/2008<br>Class Name: ART101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Classes are so boring, and its mandatory umm....one i missed like 3 or 4 classes missed one practice paper and ended up with a B...she just shows slides and lectures, its a requirement so take her i guess but man it was boring</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2008<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a pretty decent professor. The class was very boring... The entire 90 minutes is slides and lecture. Attendance is mandatory, she takes it before the start of every class. Mid-term and Final were very easy. Simple slide memorization, and there is one major paper which isnt too bad. If your looking for an easy art class to pass, this is it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2008<br>Class Name: ART238<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love this lady!  Its pointless to read the assignments she gives you cuz she goes over it in class.  Shes open to ALL opinions and cares about her students.  The midterm and final are a typical art history final.  Slide ids and comparisons.  I would recommend her to anyone!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2007<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really nice and the class is interesting.

Really approachable, definitely take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2006<br>Class Name: HON2<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The main thing that I remember about her class is that she is very accepting of students' interpretations in artworks, even if they aren't exactly what they are supposed to mean.  Very respectful and inspiring.  And very, very nice.  I would take more of her classes, but I'm not really an art person.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2006<br>Class Name: ART239<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take this class, or take her in another one!

Her lectures keep you interested and she chooses a great selection of works to show that aren't the classically studied pieces.  She grades fairly but is easier than she is harder.  Take her, she is a doll!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2006<br>Class Name: ART239<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved her! Although the art pieces covered were not the most interesting to look at it, she was very clear in her lectures and there is nearly no homework.  When there was work it was a packet to read and a 5 sentence summary and one question.  Not bad, and just make sure to make flashcards on the art pieces.  One big final paper at the end also.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/24/2005<br>Class Name: ART381<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Joanna.

She is the most helpful teacher I've had at DePaul. The work load is not bad- readings everyday but no quizzes or midterm. One paper and a final take home...not bad at all.
