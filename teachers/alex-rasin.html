But he made the class interesting and is willing to answer all your questions before moving on. HW is tough but it makes you learn a lot and is very useful. Very flexible with your choice of the final project. Its pretty much open ended. I would take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: CSC455<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Alex is awesome!

His lectures and lecture notes are very well organized, something he obviously puts a lot of thought into in order to effectively teach the course. He was always willing to address students concerns and questions during class. Also his email responses to questions mailed were always quick</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2012<br>Class Name: CSC451<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far one of the two best professors I have had at DePaul...more professors should have the ability and enthusiasm in TEACHING students as he does.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2012<br>Class Name: CSC451<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an AMAZING professor!!I went in with no experience or knowledge of Database and came out very confident and very well-versed.He does an excellent job and explains so well, drills the concepts in you and makes sure you understand like no other instructor will teach a novice.He is so helpful, fun, approachable and engaging.HIGHLY recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2012<br>Class Name: CSC451<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Outstanding professor! His method of teaching was very effective, as he provided numerous examples/practice in class, which made me truly understand the material; he replies very quickly to emails and LOVES when students ask questions.  I also enjoyed his sense of humor and highly recommend him. I am looking forward to taking more classes with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2012<br>Class Name: CSC451<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class can be difficult if you've never used SQL before, however, he is very helpful and understanding.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2012<br>Class Name: CSC451<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very helpful and always reachable by phone or email. Grades are fair enough. No surprises in the mid or final exams. If you are not CS major, donâ??t ever worry he assumes that you have no solid background and starts the concepts form the basic level step by step. Not hard to get an A. Strongly recommend it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2012<br>Class Name: CSC451<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the greatest professors I have met from my experience as a student.  His style of teaching allows students to understand the material and enjoy it.  He gives enough examples during class and outside of class to ensure that everything is clearly understood and replies extremely fast on emails and makes sure that all questions are answered.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2012<br>Class Name: CSC451<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He works extremely hard to make sure that students understand the concepts and content of the course.  His professionalism in and out of class were exemplary. He is very organized and keep the students interested.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2012<br>Class Name: CSC451<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He repeats the contents over and over so it's impossible to not remember the materials. For someone that does not have a strong database background, take him! if you are pretty confident with your entities, relationships and cardinality, this class might be too slow and little boring. Overall, he definitely helped strengthen my knowledge</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2012<br>Class Name: CSC451<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I recommend Prof.Alex to any student. He's very helpful and approachable. Before taking the course,i was hesitant on taking it with him because he's a new professor but after attending the classes, i realized i made the right decision. I'm still waiting for my grades but even if i get a low grade, which i doubt,I still think he's a great professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2011<br>Class Name: CSC451<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly he makes an already dry subject more unbearable. He took over the class for another teacher and he is not doing any better. He does go over anything you do not understand, and he will continue to do it until you get it. Office hours are awful  but he does email within 24 hrs. Somewhat Easy A, just very dry.</div></div></div></body></html>
