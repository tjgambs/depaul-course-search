You are going to learn alot! Would you want anything else from a class? Although the texts are difficult, if you don't understand something Professor Hill will spend time helping you after class.

He wants everyone to get a good grade and will sit with you outside of class to rewrite your assignments.

He encourages discussion, but he'll spend a lot of time lecturing which, after a while, gets boring. Really relatable & tells funny, personal stories. Always uses real-life examples in his lectures. Very flexible about due dates & assignments. Wants you to do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2013<br>Class Name: PHL202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Favorite professor at DePaul in the philo department.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2013<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unclear, unhelpful, and nasty attitude when I contacted him by email for help.

He's willing to work with students until they understand and will answer any question that a student asks. Extremely knowledgable and friendly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2011<br>Class Name: PHL204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Hill is amazing. Seriously take him. He treats his students as equals and creates an environment that fosters discussion. He's incredibly kind and understanding both in and outside of class. He trusts his students and respects them and their viewpoints. Not to mention, the man is brilliant. Incredibly intelligent. Take. Him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/27/2010<br>Class Name: PHL300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is smart, insightful and very easy to listen to and understand from in class.  He responds well to those who engage in class but I didn't say a word ever and he didn't judge or punish me for it in grading.  I would definitely take another one of his classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2010<br>Class Name: PHL380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've had Hill for several classes and I recommend him. If you do the reading and keep up with the syllabus you should be fine. He's also available to students if they need help in the class. He makes himself available during office hours. One has to work hard to fail his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2010<br>Class Name: PHL204<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It might have been bad acoustics in the classroom, but I found him hard to hear/understand a lot of times.  Still, he's got a good relaxed approach to the class and is a fair grader.  Doesn't overload students with work. Just 2 tests and a paper. Was fine for me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2007<br>Class Name: PHL200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am sorry, but Professor Hill is absolutely the best professor I have taken!!!  It sucks that he is getting terrible ratings, when he is such awesome professor.  Yes, the class is challenging, even flat our difficult at times, but if you pay attention, take great notes and study it is possible to get a good grade.  I received a well deserved A!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2006<br>Class Name: PHL314<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWFUL professor. Snotty, rude, unhelpful and unclear. Likes to belittle students. In addition, places material on exams and quizzes that he has never gone over in class. Favors philosophy majors, so if anyone here who has rated him positively is one, that's why. Overall, stay away from this idiot unless you already know the material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: PHL200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>seriously, find someone better......</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2006<br>Class Name: PHL200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The syllabus does not have due dates. He attempts to give due dates in class but are never accurate. Does an awful job explaining things, wants students to discuss material, but it is complicated material to discuss without the professor expalaining anything. Tough grader, you really have to like philosophy for this guys class, find someone better</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2006<br>Class Name: PHL200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>yeah hes pretty bad. i have no clue what goes on in class at least 80% of the time.  materials are very confusing and he doesnt do a really good job on explaining things.  He also gets throw off by student's comment alot.  Good to know that it aint just me tho ^^</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2006<br>Class Name: PHL200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He doesn't explain things very weell, and though I study I still get low grades. Still uses a midterm from 2003!Half of what was on it we never talked about in class (and I never ditch class either). I would never take him again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you put real effort into the work you do in this class it will pay off. Your grade is an accurate representation of your work and essenstially the effort you put into it. Poor effort will surely lead to a poor grade. Earning an A is much more satisfying than having it handed to you on an &quot;easy A platter&quot;. Not a class for slackers but RECOMMENDED</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2005<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I absoultely love Professor Hill. :)  He should be director of Philosophy.

His knows what he is talking about but I have hard time to understand him sometimes because he uses hard vocab word when explaining his materials.

Very proper I might add.  If you want to do good, definitely participate in class and if you still don't get it, talk to him about topics at hand after class because he is always willing to explain something to you</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is awesome! He is always offering to help students understand.  Even if he has to break it down into steps sometimes.  Really gets the class engaged with learning the material.  He understands how to approach each topic and relate it to society. I would definatley take him again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>honestly he is a nice teacher and knows what he is talking about. but he talks to his class as if he will be talking to a group of philosophers! his test are difficult and he doesnt return emails. if you are not a philosphy major, dont take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i had a hard time understanding the concept of philosophy.. i still do but thanks to him i somewhat understand it more. cool guy. really fun teacher. some of the time he's hard to understand but you have a party at the end of the semester.. that was FUN!! take him :) i got a B+.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's AWESOME. His class was hard because I couldn't understand what he was saying, he uses BIG words that you try to skip that sentence & pick up from the next, but you can't. He's EXTREMELY intelligent & very easy to approach. There's only one midterm, final, & quiz. There's weekly discussion notes as well. Yes we had a party.

Dresses really well. . smells nice, too. Quiz/Final questions are hard, though I went to class about 50% of the time and got an A-.If you are a good writer, you'll do fine.

He follows a philosophy of true love for humanity as a whole, and this is what his ISP 200 class is based on: moral cosmopolitanism. He cares about your success and will help you.

Very intellectually stimulating.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Hill is friendly, helpful and full of energy. He is just out there to get the students to socialize in class. If you like to sit in a class and not talk, I wouldn't take it. If you love to participate, go for it.

The topic material isn't really something I'm interested in, but I did enjoy class.  If you show up to class and pay attention then you don't really need to do the readings.
