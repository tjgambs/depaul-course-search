Had him for The Trial and Death of Socrates and I couldn't be more glad I did. Naas makes the class really enjoyable, and as long as you do the readings, you'll be just fine. Extremely intelligent and very, very interesting. Listen to all he has to say, and I promise you'll gain more than just a credit. Would take again. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2010<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had him for a focal point on the trail and death of Socrates, and i never thought it would actually be interesting. Professor naas is a great teacher and a great guy, one of the smartest people i've ever met. He's a very lenient teacher, just do the readings</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2010<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While it's clear that Naas knows a lot about philosophy and is very passionate about it, his habit of constantly throwing out foreign words and going off on tangents about the large philosophy texts he has read and his many experiences in France and Europe gets very irritating. I found the class to be extremely dull, but to be fair, he is nice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2010<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Naas knows his stuff when it comes to philosophy, languages, memorization techniques, etc. and tries to teach it all, but he is not good with explaining philosophy. There was a lot of reading and quizzes and in class he mostly summarized the readings.  The grade is determined from 2 papers and the quiz grade. Not much guidance overall.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2009<br>Class Name: LSP102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took him for a focal point class. I did not talk much in class, but gained so much  just by listening to him because he is so knowledgable. He really tries to teach his students everything that he knows and goes out of his way to help his students. Attendance is not mandatory, however, there are easy quizzes every class period. I learned ALOT!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>michael naas is a very big dork, you cant help but love him and his tangents. he has taught me so much, far more about life than just philosophy. i really enjoy his class. there is a quiz almost everyday, which are easy if you do the reading. class discussion is thought provoking and you learn so much. take his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I adored Michael Naas! He is just such a jovial fellow, always seems beautifully content with life and that permeates into his classroom. Pay attention to what he says - he is a modest genius and knows more about everything than many professors I've encountered at DePaul. Love him and keep an open mind - his class is fascinating if you make it so!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is such a wonderful professor. There is a bit of reading, and daily quizzes, but class is interesting, and he makes sure to keep it interesting. He has the most wonderful stories to tell, and is very intelligent. The papers are not difficult, but grading is relatively difficult. All in all, I recommend taking him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2007<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Naas tends to pick favorites pretty early on and he doesn't seem to give some students much credit after he's pigeonholed them in one way or another, no matter what they produce. That said, he's a pretty impressive scholar and a generally decent guy compared to some other professors out there. Occasionally lectures can be dry and unproductive.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2006<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was disappointed after taking this class. The focus seemed to be more on the text of ancient greek philosophers than their ideas and much of class was spent summarizing the reading. An interesting guy but he doesn't relate to his students very well. Do the readings and take time on the papers and it's not that bad... just not that great either.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2006<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very nice guy. helpful and available for students. class grade is 1/3 reading quizzes (sparknotes provided PLENTY of information to ace the quizzes), and then 1/3 each for two 5-7 page papers. Topics not hard but should put a little time into the papers.  You don't have to work very hard to get a good grade</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You should totally take him if you get the chance. He's a fantastic teacher- you really learn a lot because he's a genius, and he's also pretty funny. He also has this cool memorization device that you can convince him to teach you and then you'll never have problems remembering dates again! Seriously, take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2005<br>Class Name: PHL300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. He was very knowledgeable about the subject and had a very entertaining and wity way of teaching. He is very helpful outside of class as well. There are quizes everyday that are easy as long as you were there the day before. 2 6-10 page papers. His grading is neither difficult nor easy. Its hard to get a C or an A. EC on some quizes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2005<br>Class Name: PLATO<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't particularly like philosophy, but I enjoyed this class. Naas is smart, witty, and extremely knowledgeable on the subject. He had 5 question quizzes almost everyday just to make sure you went to class. We also had to write two 6 page papers. The discussions in class were good and learning the greek alphabet was the easiest part of the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2005<br>Class Name: PHLPLATO<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just finished the Plato class. I don't agree with the other comment that it was a waste of time to learn the Greek alphabet. The text was in Greek AND English and reference was made throughout the course to better translations of the Greek! Naas is amazing - funny, witty, learned, extemporaneous, and above all a very good professor. He teaches!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I wasted my time and money with this class.  We only read Plato on Socrates and we had to memorize the Greek alphabet for a grade.  That's not Philosophy, that's a waste of my time and money.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/13/2005<br>Class Name: FOCALPNT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought he was a great professor.  try to attented all class if possible it will help you maintain you grade.  i love him.  he tries to be really funny and sometime he really is.  Philosopy is his passion.  i got really into it.  i am changing my minor to it.  he is great you'll love him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/29/2005<br>Class Name: ISPSOCRATES<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.
