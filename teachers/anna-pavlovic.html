She wants her students to succeed.  You learn in this class how to be a more entertaining speaker and presenter.  It is a pretty easy class if you keep up with the deadlines.  The negatives are that there is a lot that you need to buy for this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2015<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is very nice but class is an extreme waste of time.  Notes and assignments are all over the place.  You have to buy several subscriptions to online resources on top of a textbook and a reading book.  Way too many extra expenses on top of the class.  What you learn is really an over exaggeration of the real world.  Avoid this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2014<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SOOO EASY. No test or quizzes no homework, boring night class but very easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2014<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely useless class. The structure of the entire quarter makes no sense and is all over the place. It is an easy A. The professor is a scientist and teaches 1 night class per quarter. Somewhat hard to understand, but not bad. TRY TO TAKE WITH FRIENDS, THE LAST 3 WEEKS ARE BASED AROUND GROUP PRESENTATIONS.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2013<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Pavlovic is amazing. She has a touch of an accent, but it is no big deal once you get use to it in 1-2 classes. Her demeanor is calm but collected. She is very nice and makes the class relatively fun and interesting. I would definitely take her again if I could.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2013<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Pavlovic is simply a great professor. She provides realistic applications to the material being taught. So long as you show up, and do what you need to be doing you will get a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2011<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very friendly and helpful.

She keeps class fun and interesting.  She actually made me interested in minoring in marketing.  I was extremely fearful at the thought of having to give speeches, but she is very understanding of this matter.  Extremely willing to help her students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2011<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Whenever I had any questions she always responded in a timely matter and always treated each student with the up most respect.

Very receptive, accommodating and willing to help all of her students. Some may misunderstand her at times because english is her 2nd language but I've had plenty of EASL-profs in the past and her command of the language is better then most. That is honestly the only possible downside.</div></div></div></body></html>
