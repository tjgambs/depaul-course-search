She's super funny and makes class interesting. The midterm is super easy and you almost don't even need to read the book because she goes over everything in class but even if you do its pretty interesting. I took it as a freshman and loved it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2013<br>Class Name: DC225<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jen is an awesome teacher and is really funny. She is really straight forward and gets straight to the point. The papers are straight forward and is only one project due at the end of the year that is done with a group.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2013<br>Class Name: ETH228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best I've had at DePaul to date. She's very helpful, caring, and respectful of everyone in the classroom. I had to miss class to go home, which resulted in two classes in a row being absent. She had no issues with it, responded to my email questions, and told me it was ok to miss class as long as I emailed. Take her class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2013<br>Class Name: DC228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SHE IS AMAZING!!! She is super fun, but she teaches you. She relates things to actual things. She is nice and doesn't teach anything unnecessary. If you look at the review she gives you for the midterm you are sure to get a 100. I got a 99.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2012<br>Class Name: GAMM228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She keeps class very interesting. she is very funny and makes you want to come to class.  Only a midterm and a group project as a final.  The midterm is really easy she goes over what will be on it.

You have to take her class; she's hands-down THE most entertaining lecturer I've ever had at DePaul. Her assignments are generally pretty interesting, too, and she explains the material in a fairly straightforward manner for easy retention.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2012<br>Class Name: DC228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jen is super energetic and really knows what she's talking about.

She is very knowledgeable about the subject which makes it easier to understand the material. The textbooks were used more for reference, so try to rent them from the public library if possible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2010<br>Class Name: DC250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is AWESOME!!! if you want an easy A take her class!!

She's hilarious, easygoing, and passionate. Don't be afraid to speak up in class and participate, because it's just a fun class and she will take your comments and expand on it. Very high energy. She will occasionally be slightly confusing but will always, always, always clarify if you ask. Her assignments are not hard at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2009<br>Class Name: EX201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. If you wanna learn the basic of Screenwriting and become a better writer, take her! Also, she loves Transformers so be sure to mention that. Plus, she's kinda cute in a goofy, fun way!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2009<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Enthusiastic and knowledgeable; it's refreshing to have a prof who has worked (and continues to work) in the field of study (screenwriting) that she's teaching. Provides fantastic feedback on drafts and writing exercises. If you do the work, you're guaranteed to finish the course as a better, more skilled writer.</div></div></div></body></html>
