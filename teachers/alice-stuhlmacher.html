Stuhlmacher is so sweet and is very invested in the success of her students. She is very willing to develop a relationship with everyone individually if you try. I have even seen her for advising just because I know she wants the best and I trust her opinion. Put in the effort, show interest, and you will be just fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2014<br>Class Name: PSY380<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She tries to explain, but doesn't always succeed that well.  Read the book every week, along with online quizzes.She can get a bit dull,but is really nice. She doesn't take attendance, but if you miss class you miss material. Pretty solid for I/O, just a bit more enthusiasm needed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2013<br>Class Name: PSY382<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher could be very creative at times. I enjoyed the subject matter, but not doing the articles can get you!! My advice to anyone, don't expect an easy A, you will have to do a nice amount of reading. The Mid-term and Final includes essay questions (she does not grade lightly) so prepare.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2013<br>Class Name: PSY343<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring, boring, boring. Have never had a more dull professor than her. She is incredibly nice and easy going but I would literally have to leave class and walk around the building to stay awake each day. Take her for the easy A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2012<br>Class Name: PSY380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really love her as a person, she's incredibly nice and sweet, but the powerpoints every single day bored me to tears. You have to really keep up with the chapters too, otherwise the midterm and final will be awful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2012<br>Class Name: PSY380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. Her powerpoints are all relevant to the exams and she is very willing to help. She also gives study guides for the midterm and final exam. If you do the readings and homework you shouldn't have a problem getting an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2010<br>Class Name: PSY382<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is awesome and so sweet. Not as easy as some people say but not the toughest class. Take her if you are interested in I/O she is super helpful and interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2008<br>Class Name: PSY382<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you like the subject you'll like her.  Alot of work for journal articles but worth it because you learn how to read those dam things.  I would recommend her if you like I/O.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2008<br>Class Name: PSY343<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Was an easy class- not too much work. Make sure you go to class b/c she does give points for little in class worksheets (VERY easy). The final project is a Test Manual, not too hard either. Its def. worth taking her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2006<br>Class Name: PSY382<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It was overall an easy class. Very relaxed and only 5 quizzes no midterm or final. I would take her again for sure</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2006<br>Class Name: PSY382OB<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The course started off pretty interesting at first, but by the end it lost steam.  She tried to keep the class engaged by showing video clips.  Does a good job helping students prepare for tests(5 quizzes).  Fair amount of homework(4 journal article write ups) and in class group work.  Overall, nice professor--good class.  Not a stressful course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2006<br>Class Name: PSYCH106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is a very boring teacher but SUPER nice. she will do whatever it takes to help u and her studyguides are very helpful. it was a really easy laid back class but sometimes it makes u want to fall asleep. i would recommend her though</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2006<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>good teacher for psych same things everyone else said applies here as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2006<br>Class Name: PSY343<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>love the study guides. no attendence. she puts forth on the syllabus what's expected point wise, and it's a laid back &quot;college&quot; class w/o the hassel.She's not the typical overzealous /self-righteous depaul professor that makes a subject harder than it needs to be for their own ego.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2005<br>Class Name: IOPSYCH<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring as hell, but if you love the subject, you'll be fine!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2005<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was really boring, but the professor is really nice. She mumbles through lectures and they are generally unhelpful, doesn't take attendence either. Class isn't really required. Light workload, exams are average.

Why&#63; Her lecturs are NON-lectures. She mumbles through them with no direction. She is also unable to teach this stuff without relying totally on PP slides. She's a PhD for crying out loud! And she reads them as if for the first time! HORRIBLE!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2005<br>Class Name: PSY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2004<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She gives very long lectures that sometimes I found it hard to stay awake!

She explains everything and is always willing to answer any questions or concerns one might have.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2004<br>Class Name: PSY380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor, she brings real world examples and film clips to make I/O psych more interesting. Lectures can be pretty boring, but she knows her stuff and goes out of her way to help you & make sure you understand. I've taken more than 1 class with her and would take her class again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2004<br>Class Name: PSY340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a  really awesome professor who is always willing to help.  Her class is not that hard as long as you study from your notes from her lectures.  Although her lectures run long a few times, she uses real life examples which makes it more fun!</div></div></div></body></html>
