She has no idea what she wants on the papers. Her classes are awful and she just rambles on about pointless stuff in the plays assigned each week. For a 100 level class, don't take whatsoever.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2013<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a terrible professor who requires a lot but will not tell you to do. If you want to have C or below in a 100 level course, just take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2013<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Average teacher. I found her to be helpful and a fair grader, but she does require a lot of what feels like busy work. Reading notes for all the plays you read (7) and bigger papers on all the plays you see (4). Too much work if you're not really interested in theater. Class atmosphere is very, very chill though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2013<br>Class Name: THE110<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOUSY excuse for a teacher. Beatrice Bosco is the reason why theatre is a dying art. Do not sign up for her class, she will make you regret registering for it until the day you receive your undeserved LOW GRADE. She is awful and her failure as a theatre phd holder is taken out on her students. STAY AWAY</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2013<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring plays. She requires a lot for assignments. Not an easy A course</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2013<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes an amazing teacher. Very helpful &she makes it interesting. In this class you read plays&discuss them. &You go watch 4 plays. The class grade depends on 3 essays that you write for 3 of 4 the plays you watch and 1 final paper. She wants everyone to succeed. I wasnt interested in theater when I took it but now I love her & this class. TAKE IT !</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2011<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, and follows a very structured syllabus. 1 play read per week with a 1 page summary. Every other week you see a play and write a 3-4 page analysis of it. Final is a 5 page analysis of a play. You MUST do all of the papers/summaries to pass the class. A pretty easy A, if you do all the work. Almost all of the plays were on sparknote.</div></div></div></body></html>
