He assigns 4 essays, but the lowest graded one is dropped. Do well on the first three and you can skip the last one. No final exam, just a very open-ended final project with a 2-3page reflectionexplanation essay of the project. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2014<br>Class Name: PHL235<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took the online hybrid class. This would be a good class for someone who struggles with philosophy, because the prof talked more about modern philosophy (no Plato or Descartes) and the philosophy of environmental problems. It was an accessible and interesting class and I don't have my grade yet but I know that I did well. Prof is a cool guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2013<br>Class Name: ENV160<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the greatest professor I've ever had at DePaul. He truly engages his students in a way that promotes them to share ideas with the rest of the class. So not only did I learn so much from Prof. Honold that has helped to evolve my perspective of life but I also gained so much from the perspectives of other students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2008<br>Class Name: PHL235<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Honold is a great professor that truly enjoys the subject matter.  Unlike most DePaul professors who just teach to get paid, Dr. Honold teaches because he loves doing so.  He clearly explains the philosophical principles at hand (unlike the other PHL teachers I've had).  You are doing yourself a great disservice if you take any teacher but him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2008<br>Class Name: PHL235<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super nice guy.  Interesting subject matter if you follow along.  I had him for night class so sometimes it got long, but other than that, great teacher, great class.  No final!  Recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2007<br>Class Name: PHI235<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fun Class.

If you're smart enough to get half of what he's saying, you'll thoroughly enjoy his teaching.  If you don't like this class, you probably shouldn't be in college.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2006<br>Class Name: PHL242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, he really explains everything clearly. He gave a ton of reading in the first few weeks and then hardly any after that. Grade consists of 4 papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/26/2006<br>Class Name: PHL242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of my favorite profs.

Easily got an A. You don't have to read, but helps if you do. Definitely take his class!!! Smart, interesting, but sometimes boring because he talks slow. Great Guy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2005<br>Class Name: PHILOSOPHY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was one of my favorite profs.

The midterm and final are pretty easy. He is a nice and helpful guy. I never did the readings but I still got an A- in a class i knew nothing about.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2005<br>Class Name: PHL242<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kind of a hard topic to learn. Tries to get you to think, but he picks very difficult and long readings. Good teacher if you like a challenge. Not too hard of a grader if you don't understand.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2005<br>Class Name: PHY242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A good Philosophy prof. Actually likes teaching and tries to instill us with his passion for the subject. Has the great ability to relate class to outside topics, especially politics. Has a great grading policy. He doesn't check for accuracy, he checks to see that you are thinking about the topic.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: PHL235<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really good professor, very interested in the subject.  My first philosophy course, and I enjoyed it--not a whole lot of history, and applicable to life.  He's helpful, understanding, and easy to relate to (and very cute!)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2005<br>Class Name: PHILOSOPHY<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. I can't help but sometimes laugh at his lectures because he goes off on all sorts of tangents.... class is easy workload is extremely light. Classes can be a drag but for once a week it's def worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2004<br>Class Name: PHL235<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very sweet, earnest guy who is passionate about teaching. Strays off topic sometimes, but wants to hear your thoughts on everything. If you're into BMX, he looks EXACTLY like Ryan Nyquist!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2004<br>Class Name: PHI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2004<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very smart and his lectures are very interesting and thought provoking.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very cute and intelligent and really kind.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2004<br>Class Name: PHILOFEN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2004<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good easy going fair grading professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2004<br>Class Name: PHI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Intelligent, kind, and understanding. Very helpful if you ask him for help. If you can't turn in a paper by the dead line,explain the situation, he won't take any points off.
