Very clear, passionate about his subject. I ended up with low grade, because I am not a good test taker, and I hate it when entire exams are multiple choice. If you're marketing major, then do take him. He is great!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2008<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great teacher. Very helpful, smart, hands on, but a hard grader. The project is a lot more work than you think, so don't put it off.

Concentrate on the midterm and final don't take it as a joke it's a big part of your grade! Know the concept and terms- its more than notes you have to read. So don't think you'll get by with notes. I got a C- and I worked hard, people in my group slacked for the project.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2007<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgable teacher.  Engages class.  A good amount of work (3 mini projects, one group project and then midterm and final) all of which aren't too bad if you make the effort.  Also offers extra credit.

Send him drafts of your tool summaries before they are due; he will always help you out.  He is always available to help out with anything.
