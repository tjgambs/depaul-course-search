FANTASTIC prof. Classes are very structured so you know what to expect, ample time to complete each project, and for the tests, you are allowed a cheat sheet. There is also a practice test online that is very similar to real test. Will spend hours with you during office hours, accessible kind man too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2014<br>Class Name: IT212<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>His assignments and class is easy enough to do online, but due to the weather the class had some assignment bumps. He uses outside graders and reliably points to the tutor for help, which can either help or hurt your grade. Make sure you don't fall behind, and unlike the 2 previous classes I'd say take this one in person.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2013<br>Class Name: IT212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good Teacher, very helpful outside of class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2013<br>Class Name: IT211IT212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome Professor... just put some effort and he'll give you code.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/03/2013<br>Class Name: CSC423<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He doesn't seem like prepared in the class...very unorganized and confusing.I completely counted other online resources to understand his class topics.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2013<br>Class Name: IT211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Solid professor.

He really cares about his students. I never turned anything in on time and still got a B+. He lets you bring a cheat sheet for exams. I never got book or paid attention, just learned day before exam. VERY easy! Great Professor!

I could add faster than he could.  He would constantly have to take out 5 mintues so he could reteach to himself what he was trying to teach to us!
