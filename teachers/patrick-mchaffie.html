He is an incredibly fair grader (unlike other GIS professors at DePaul) and also provides a lot of good feedback. This is not the class for students who are used to being spoon-fed everything. I would recommend him and take him again! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2015<br>Class Name: 241<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is pretty unclear, and does a terrible job creating a community for his online class. Very insensitive to students with personal challenges, and expects everyone to be as interested in his subject matter as he is. STAY AWAY.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2015<br>Class Name: PSC201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: D</div><div id="right"><div>I had a tough time in this course, so I didn't do very well, but prof. McHaffie is very helpful, and is willing to work with students, and give them extra time, to complete assignments. He isn't a pushover, but he's not so strict with deadlines. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/01/2014<br>Class Name: GEO241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Probably the most helpful professor I've had here at DePaul. Replied to every e-mail/question of mine within 30 minutes tops (with extensive feedback). He goes above and beyond to provide his students with the materials necessary to succeed in GIS. As someone mentioned above, you get back what you put in. And he has a southern accent. Great guy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2014<br>Class Name: GEO243<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. McHaffie is one of my favorite professors.  He is a wealth of knowledge for those seeking it. If you are looking to grasp higher-level concepts, specifically when dealing with spatial relations and geographic environs, engage him in a conversation, he will leave you in awe. You get back what you put in, that is his style.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2014<br>Class Name: GEO243<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class! His lectures are not very helpful. Midterm and final are not hard just have to read the text. He doesn't really teach much but is  a very nice guy and tries to help but in my opinion confuses students more. Its an easy class to take.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2013<br>Class Name: GEO243<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2013<br>Class Name: GEO143<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really nice guy. His style of teaching is pretty hands off which can be frustrating. However, if you use it to your advantage to try and figure things out for yourself, then you can possibly come out of the course pretty informed. His videos are very clear and a useful tool.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2013<br>Class Name: GEO341<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Anyone who thinks McHaffie is an awful professional is not working hard enough. The material is dense, but Pat makes the class fun every time. He is hysterical and if you actually put in work like students should, you will learn a ton and have fun while you do it. Great guy, great professor. The dude is brilliant.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/11/2011<br>Class Name: GEO243<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stay away. Nice guy, but probably one of the worst teachers I have ever encountered. His lectures make no sense so unless you want to ready over 400 pages of a text book in two weeks- DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Everything he provides for students (lecture, notes, assignment hand outs) are unclear, poorly worded, and make no sense.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2011<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this guy is all over the place. he frequently rambles about things that no one cares of. his teaching skills are mediocre (the lab technician did most of the teaching) and even if you give 110% in the class, he won't boost your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2010<br>Class Name: GEO241<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a pretty good professor. At times it is hard to understand the logistics of the material presented but He knows his GIS. The activities in this class really do teach you how to use the program. Take him if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2008<br>Class Name: GEO170<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor really likes coffe & talks about it all the time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2007<br>Class Name: GEO170<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easiest class ever.  Final is a paper and tests were common sense.  Curves most exams a few points.  Discussions mean naptime, because so pointless.  Has some interesting stories but usually not related to class at all.  Take him if you want an easy A or B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2006<br>Class Name: GEO170<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>cool and laid back guy, geo was fun</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2006<br>Class Name: GEO170<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is so boreing.  Stories are bad.  Notes make no sense, and projects/homework are wierd.  He not a bad guy, but not the best teacher.  Test are common sense, but final is a book report.  Takes frequent days off.  Take him only if you really like geography or you like boring classes.  But he is helpful</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2006<br>Class Name: GEO170<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is Extremely boring, but also easy. I have not bought the 100 dollar textbook, nor do i need to. tests are all about common sense.  Decent teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2005<br>Class Name: GIS12<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unorganized, unclear, and unsatisfactory as a teacher and advisor. WAAAAAAAYYY too much on his plate. Never had our assignments and papers or anything ready on time and made you feel awful for asking for them when he's so damn busy. I recieve 10 forwarded e-mails from him a day but somehow he cannot find the time in his precious overpacked schedule</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2005<br>Class Name: GEO242<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awful: personality=bad, jokes=worse, material= poorly organized, personal knowledge= lost in his palm pilot. . this man has too much on his plate to teach a class. . department head, unfortunately. . prospective students. .  look elsewhere for GIS instruction</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: GEO242<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>McHaffie has improved as a teacher since the last time I took one of his GIS classes.  He is very understanding, and available outside of class. He has improved in his clarity for both quizes and lectures. GIS may be confusing, but if your interested, it is worth learning</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2004<br>Class Name: ALL<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great guy to take a class with. not always clear, but if you have a will to learn its worth it. he's a fair grader and dosent give too much work, a good professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2004<br>Class Name: GEOGRAPHY<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take this professor if you can teach yourself how to use GIS systems</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2004<br>Class Name: GEO241<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lectures for the entire class, doesn't allow much time for Labs, not clear on final progect, were in the 6th week now, and i still have no clue on the final progect.

Pat was a good catalyst for learning and made me learn...in my own way.  If all you get from Pat is &quot;Jokes&quot; etc...ya ought to have done the reading and maybe what he said would have made more sense.

He doesn't teach and you are left on your own to learn. It makes the class twice as hard as it needs to be. Avoid him for classes.
