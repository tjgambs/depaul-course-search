Arnott to be very intelligent, fun, and fair.  She knows she is teaching a really boring subject, and she tries her best to make it fun.  The fact that she is drop dead gorgous helps matters!  I found the class to be extremely easy, the lectures are boring, though, but she tries to include lots of activities, highly reccomended</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2005<br>Class Name: STATS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hottie!  Takes a very relaxed attitude to homework and tests.  Try to keep up with homework and take notes in class and you should get an 'A'.  Also She is hot and this is good compensation for boring lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the hottest chicks I've ever seen, also a good teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>In addition to be gorgeous... she's actually a really good teacher.  I HATE math, and she made the intro course kind of fun, and I actually learned a lot.  She doesn't grade too hard and is reallly understanding if you don't get something, miss a class, turn something in late, etc.  As long as you communicate with her, she's great. =)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Arnott is such a nice woman but she def makes it a point to let you know if she does not like you. Very very helpful in explaining material. Does not give any homework and when she does, it's easy as hell! Cheat sheets for both mid terms and finals are allowed to be used! TAKE IT</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2005<br>Class Name: RMT2<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very organized and open to suggestion in the class.

The shortened summer session made it a lot more tolerable, plus she rarely grasded the material.  Just show up to class and get a guarenteed B+/A-</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2005<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor!!!
