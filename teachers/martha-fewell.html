I had her for an online course, and she was horrible.  She's extremely disorganized, doesn't respond to email in a timely manner if you have a question (if at all), and her expectations for course assignments were different wherever you looked.  She's also pretty rude</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2005<br>Class Name: TL405<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A bad professor and a bad person.  This is the worst professor I have ever had.  She failed to live up to her own expectations of class and did not take responsibilty for her actions.  This class has caused me and my classmates a lot of greif.  Most students received bad grades.  Stay Away!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2004<br>Class Name: TL405<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First class I had ever taken were I learned more from my fellow classmates than from the teacher.

She returns homework 1 month late, if she returns it at all. She's a biased grader, totally unclear on what she expects. She arrives late, is unprepared and talks endlessly about herself. She's consistently an obstacle to learning. Do NOT take this course. Do NOT take this prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2004<br>Class Name: TL405<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The absolute worst professor in recorded history</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2004<br>Class Name: TL405<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2004<br>Class Name: TL405<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is disorganized and uncommitted.
