The instructor just summarizes the book chapters every class and usually lets you out early.  There is a quiz, a midterm, and a final.  There are also HW assignments each class.  They are not graded but if you do not do them he will lower your grade.  Overall a pretty easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2014<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Grade consists of a tough exam wo a review, a midterm and final both with a review and reads out exam questions outloud. His exams are difficult but if you study and read the material an A for the midterm and final are possible. Lectures are tedious. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2014<br>Class Name: BLAW<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy A. Extremely boring. Dont get the textbook. If you actually want to learn take someone else. If you just want the A take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2013<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This course was extremely boring to say the least. BLW has the potential to be an interesting course, but not with this professor. There are 2 tests and 1 quiz. They are all really easy if you put in a little effort to study for them. If you want to learn anything from business law take someone else though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2013<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Garber is a pretty easy and nice teacher. I had no qualms with him, and he was always nice to me so I cannot complain. I would say take him if you could. He has a lot of interesting stories that gets you through a rough law class, that is horribly dry no matter what teacher you take.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2013<br>Class Name: BLW202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take this professor! Do exactly what he tells you & you will ace this class. Law is boring but he does his best to make it interesting. Would definitely take again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2013<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would recommend him if you are just trying to get this class out of the way. He gives you all the questions word for word in the exams a week before taking them. There are briefs due every class but I am not even sure if he looks at them. I did them anyways just to be safe.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2013<br>Class Name: BUSINESSLAW20<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy A! Mr.Garber is a very nice and funny teacher. He gives out the questions to the mid-term and final. Amazing teacher! The only negative thing is that sometimes its hard to hear him because he talks alittle soft.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2013<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Garber is a funny older man with a lot of experience under his belt that makes class interesting. There are no surprises on the Exams and he truly wants you to do well. He goes over exactly what will be on the midterm and final. Expecting an A in this class. I highly recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2013<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked this class. Garber is a funny old man with a lot of experience. He does talk a little quietly at times, especially with the CTA trains passing by every 5 minutes. There are briefs due but he won't make fun of you if they aren't done. Can get a lot out of this class. Also covers what's on Midterm and Final. Would recommend</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2011<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Garber is a great professor to take for this class. He definitely knows the material he's teaching. You have to do about 1-2 briefs and chapter problems for homework every class but  if you do the work you'll get an A. Tests are T/F, and he has a review before each test where he gives almost all the test questions. Easy, very interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/28/2011<br>Class Name: BLW203<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Too much information cramped into short quarter, hard to keep up, great deal of time outside of class required.

He will give you an idea of what will be on the midterm and final, so there really isn't any excuse to get anything lower than a B.  Class can get a little boring, just him lecturing, nothing written on the board.  I felt I could  skip a lot of class and still get a B no problem as long as I read the book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2009<br>Class Name: BLW101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Garber is the man.  He's a funny old dude. There's a quiz, a midterm, and a final. All of which he'll tell you exactly what to study before hand. There are briefs due each week, but he really doesn't look at them.  If you can memorize well, you can get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2009<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lectures are him talking ... boring and too long.

He was so informative, and always uses his real life experiences to explain any concept you should know in the class.  Made class VERY interesting.  Gives a great study overview, for test and midterm- just MAKE SURE you attend on those days, or you're screwed.  Read the book, do the briefs, pay attention in class and you'll do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2009<br>Class Name: BLW203<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Knows his stuff but obviously hates teaching class, always bumming rides off students. On the plus side, gives out all Q's on exams, curves a lot & class is always under an hr for a 3 hr night class. Take him if you want a blowoff class, don't if you actually want to learn something.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2008<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You really do need to read the chapters to do well in this class and I found that out the hard way, as tests are difficult and lectures are entirely verbal (no notes on board or anything.)Otherwise, nice guy and he knows what he's doing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2008<br>Class Name: AABBAABB<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I LOVE THIS PROESSOR! he makes everyone want to keep learning and his stories in class always keep things interesting. i totally recommend this professor and who knows&#63; having him in class may make you want to change your major!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2008<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ok professor. material is very boring and dry. read the text book and listen in class and you should be fine. test's aren't bad and he'll tell you everything that's on it before hand.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2008<br>Class Name: BL201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The night class gets to be extremely long sometimes.

He is tough on the students sometimes, but believe me you will understand why once you graduate and get a real job. He has been a great mentor as well as friend for me and I learned a lot from him. He knows everything about law and he is a great teacher..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2007<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very uneasy professor, he never wanted to help me outside of class and when I called him to meet with him for a final review that I missed, he refused to help me out.

Very knowledgable, great guy! I'm a senior and took this when I first came to DePaul; Still my fave class ever!  Just take notes of the chapters, and digest the material before hand and his instruction will compliment.  Everything you study will be on the tests..simple!  Best A ever!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2007<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting professor. Keeps you entertained. Never been a moment where I was bored in the class. It's hard, but if you take good notes and pay attention to his teaching, you will be fine. One thing good about is sometimes he gives hints away. If i had to chance to take business law again, I would take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2006<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Garber was a good teacher.  Lots of homework for the class though.  I had lots of trouble with BLW.  He gave good examples to understand the material, but the tests are hard as hell.

First quiz and mid-term you can easily pass just by studying what he tells you to. If you want an 'A' on the final you should probably read the chapters though.

I have never really been interested in law, but he changed my mind, and now I'm considering law school. Goes over specifics of what will be on exams.
