Definitely recommend it, a much better arts and lit credit than many other offerings. He's so cooky and down to earth and just a fun guy. Kinda sucks that he assigns so many things and has so many essays though. Could be worse I guess. Still recommend it, he's not the worst grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2012<br>Class Name: DC228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor with great enthusiasm and charm. Class is not as easy as some may say it is but if you pay attention and do at least some of the reading you can get by quite well! Final is the best thing ever! You'll see!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2012<br>Class Name: DC228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class. Can get kind of boring sometimes if you're not into philosophy. He tries his best to make the lesson sound interesting. He's a cool teacher but I didn't connect with him well like some of the other students did, mainly because I'm not huge on participating so I never really got to speak to him personally. Still good teacher nevertheless</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2010<br>Class Name: GAM228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's such a cooky fun guy for his age I love it...Reading the book helped me alot but it's definitely doable to go without reading it.  Do exactly what he asks in his papers and u got an A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2010<br>Class Name: GAM228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy, really brings life to the topic and his stories are hilarious. Do exactly what he asks (which isnt an incredible amount) and youre guaranteed an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2010<br>Class Name: IT228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! He lacks in returning paper feedback and grades to students before before having to submit the next paper. There is no way in telling what to fix in your writing until two papers later, which is a down fall on his part.... Otherwise he is very passionate about this subject... Take if you have interest in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2009<br>Class Name: IT228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great teacher. I had no interest in video games before the class, but it was an easy way to get a philosophical requirement out of the way. No tests, and grades pretty easily on papers. Best final ever; you'll see if you take him. Totally worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/27/2009<br>Class Name: ETH101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i love this man! his class is sort of boring but he is honestly the coolest professor i've had at DePaul so far...just do the homework and its an easy A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2009<br>Class Name: GAM224<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Charley is one heck of a character! He's a very knowledgable guy and EXTRMELY passionate and quirky. You will learn some interesting things in his class to be sure. He also runs DeFRAG, so he gets major props for that in my opinion as well. He really does care about the students in his class, which is a really welcome change. Definitely one to take</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2009<br>Class Name: GAM224<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good teacher, would recommend.

Ignore good comments. You read the book a lot and take 3 hard exams through the quater. You cannot understand him. He is a waste of time and you have to go to class. Do NOT TAKE HIM!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2007<br>Class Name: GAM224<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class seems tough at first with all of the deadlines and rules he has in regards to papers and assignments.  Yet he wants everyone to get an A and as long as you study for the quizes and write two decent papers, you will get an A.  Class lectures can be boring at times.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2007<br>Class Name: GAM101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was awesome. Charley made it a lot of fun, and was really open to discussion and other ideas. Structure: a few quizzes (you get a detailed outline of the questions), a couple papers, and final project. A lot of group work. A lot of fun in-class activities. He eally makes it interesting. His reactions and personality are hilarious.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/19/2006<br>Class Name: GAM224<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing Professor, Easy A, You'll learn a lot</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2006<br>Class Name: TDC361<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Charley definitely knows his stuff and makes it fun and interesting.I took this class as a DL student and could not be happier once I understood the way he taught.  He tends to teach topics that don't always correlate with the study guides. Don't get frustrated when you get study guide questions wrong because he told you something else.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2005<br>Class Name: GAM224<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He rox!! He is upbeat and keeps you laughing and interested in class, he isnt stuck up like other profs.  He knows soo much about what he teaches.  He is awesome.. the best prof I have taken at depaul yet.  I wish he taught all my classes (and i am NOT in defrag)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2005<br>Class Name: GAM224<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/03/2005<br>Class Name: GAM224<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Charlie is absolutely awesome, he is hyper-active and passionate about gaming and technology. His parties rock and he is also hilarious. The class can be difficult at some times if you don't keep up with the homework, but if u arent a complete idiot and know how to use DLWEB you will be just fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/29/2005<br>Class Name: TDC361<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Charley is a great professor - always willing to lend the extra help, and extremely enthusiastic to the point where you'd be interested in what would be otherwise really boring subjects.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/17/2005<br>Class Name: GAM224<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome guy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2005<br>Class Name: IT263<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2005<br>Class Name: IT263<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is just great! Keeps you awake and gives easy homework/midterm/finals. Its all multiple choice stuff so all you have to do is memorize answers, doesnt get better than that. Hes picky on the attendance part, so make sure you dont miss more than 2 classes. Overall one of the easiest teachers out there. If you want an EASY A, look no further.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2005<br>Class Name: REL361<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good guy, very bright.
