If you're a comm major, a lot of the core info you learn is repetitive, but she makes lectures interesting and applies theories in interesting ways. Study for the midterm and final, you'll do fine, and make sure you do the readings to help with your papers. Other than that, I'd take her again. She's super nice and knows her stuff!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2014<br>Class Name: INTC324<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Barb is very fun! Her class is interesting but can get a bit boring at times. It is mandatory to rad since the midterm an final are completely based on the readings. Not hard to get an A but must read.

She is intelligent, sarcastic (somewhat cynical) and applies the course content to the practical lives of students. You can get by without doing the readings, but then you are really just shortchanging yourself because the content is fascinating. Take her class, be a critical consumer!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2012<br>Class Name: ENV150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I absolutely loved Professor Willard. I learned so much in her class and she is extremely hilarious. It was hard to be bored in her class. Her pop quizzes are a bit ridiculous because she picks stuff no one would ever remember, but besides that she's a great professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/18/2011<br>Class Name: PPS332<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>wonderful</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/18/2011<br>Class Name: PPS332<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is intelligent, well versed, compassionate, and active in her field, as well as an animated and engaging lecturer. What more does this student want, other than to form a study/course around following her example and not those self serving fonts of pompousness they call profs.! Plus she's a hot grandmother!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/18/2011<br>Class Name: PPS330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had her across topics. she is very good at taking complex materiel and breaking it down to comprehensible units, plus her enthusiasm is enervating.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2011<br>Class Name: ENV140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fantastic Class and professor. DePaul is lucky to have her. Kinda zany in a good way. Really approachable. Good reading assignments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2011<br>Class Name: ENV150<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I never read a single page prior to the mid term and final and attended about 20% of the classes.

Barb is quite knowledgeable and always is there for students. Responds promptly to email. Extremely easy to approach, teaches well and explains everything thoroughly. One of the most fun times I've had in class. She is highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2010<br>Class Name: ENV150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Barbara Willard is by far the BEST teacher that I have ever had at DePaul within the 3.25 years that I have been here.  She is very thorough given the amount of subjects she needs to instruct.  She respects everyone and in turn her students respect her.  I wish that I took this class as a freshman because it will make you love DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/15/2010<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Barb is a lot of fun.

There's 1 group project and 1 solo project, both of which aren't terrible but a little annoying if you don't dig communication.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/28/2009<br>Class Name: CMNS220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SHE IS AMAZING! I loved going to her classes because she knows how to keep her class interesting and entertaining. She has such a positive energy to her that I ALWAYS looked forward to attending her classes. I am already trying to see what classes she is teaching next quarter so that I could take her again!! Definitely recommend her!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/27/2009<br>Class Name: CMN330<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have her for Ad and Society and had her for Environmental Rhetoric.

Three speeches. If you give your last speech early, you have the last two weeks to do nothing! Barb makes 8 am fun! Do not buy the book.  So unnecessary.One of my favorite professors at DePaul thus far!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2009<br>Class Name: CMNS220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Barb is awesome! She makes public speaking a good time, as much as you may dread it. You only have to give 3 speeches, and there are no exams or quizzes so don't even bother buying the book! You will learn so much from her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2009<br>Class Name: CMNS220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Barb is a fantastic teacher! I thought I would dread giving speeches but she makes the classroom a really great environment.  She's always gives encouraging and postive feedback. You give three speeches. No tests or papers.

A must take!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2008<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A must take for public speaking.  I literally was one of those students who absolutely feared speaking in public.  After taking her class, I am now seriously able to give speaches in my other classes or in public confidently.  Very energic and very helpful.  Unnecessary midterm/final, but they were very easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: CMN321<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super cute and enthusiastic! loved her even though the subject of the class &quot;cultural/symbolic criticiss&quot; was kinda wierd. There was a midterm and final exam along with a 8-10 pg final paper. Does a lot of group activities. Towards the end the class became more enojable! she never takes attendance but does not post powerpoints=wats on exams</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2008<br>Class Name: CMN324<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is so passionate about the subjects she teaches.  You learn SOOO much!  Makes you REALLY start to think about the world. I never really read anything because she's so good at lecturing (and I still got A's on the exams).  Just take good notes, and study off of those.  The paper is easy and she's a very fair grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2007<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Enough about the precious little animals, already!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2007<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Barb is great! very fun and cares a lot about her students. crystal clear in what she is looking for in the speeches and she creates a very positive and comfortable environment to give speeches. 3  easy test - if you go to class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2007<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is wonderful!

She has a passion for the subject and is really interesting. Her expectations aren't that high, so the class isn't that hard. You'll find yourself doing great work, just because you like her though. The class really helped me to understand the adverstising and PR world better. Plus she's hysterical!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2006<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love her! She is one of the best teachers, and she is so energetic at 8:30 in the morning that she keeps you awake. I felt so comfortable speaking in front of the class, and she creates a great atmosphere.
