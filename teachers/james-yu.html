We used the book for only the first half of class. He came through for me, without being asked, when I medically needed it. He's just a poor communicator, which doesn't exactly equate to a good professor. Hes a heavy-PowerPoint professor, you wont loose out much by taking this course OL.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2013<br>Class Name: TDC511<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a challenging class, but you do learn a lot. He answers emails promptly. His test is difficult, but you walk away learning so much. As other people have pointed out, he is picky about the lab reports, but all you need to do is follow the template he provides. Only advice is maybe take this class by itself because the work is time consuming.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2013<br>Class Name: TDC511<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He believes that he never do things wrong at all. when you just try to ask him about a grade why he detect from you , he will put you in his mind and make sure that you will not get a good grades.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2013<br>Class Name: TDC511<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A tough class to start. Very time consuming and material intensive. Lots of people complain about this professor but all you have to do is meet with him if you don't understand something or you miss something. This teacher is incredibly smart and really know what he is talking about. All you have to do is ask.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/24/2013<br>Class Name: TDC511<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably the worst instructor at DePaul CDM. He knows his stuff but does not care whether students understand the course content or not. Those who care to ask questions are answered harshly. Avoid the instructor at all costs (Am not kidding)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2013<br>Class Name: TDC511<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible.

Sometimes he is hard to understand and he is extemely critical on grading.  when says he will take point he means it.  Knowling this is the key to getting As in his classes.  his classes are challenging and you will walk away with more knowledge than with many other professors.  It is worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2011<br>Class Name: TDC463<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very solid professor,,although he is giving me a hard time ,,,I still like his labs...u learn alot with him but don't even think about the grade</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2011<br>Class Name: TDC463<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Yu is a good guy and his lectures are pretty interesting.  The problem is that he is not very good at answering questions and it is hard to get a straight answer from him.  He has a propensity to write ambiguous questions that only he really knows what he means.  He gave us home due SATURDAY before our mid term (Monday)which is not cool.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2011<br>Class Name: TDC463<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgeable,enthusiastic but extremely strict...his teaching methods are bad..I don't recommend anybody to take his class ! !</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2006<br>Class Name: TDC511<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Weekly lab assignments are easy,he defaults everybody at an A-,he said most of us don't have technical writing skills.He shouldn't base the grade on tech writing skills!After all we are here to learn, he should teach us!The final sucked,he put more Linux &#63;s than TDC stuff.Will not answer ANY &#63;s about the final once released, even if a &#63; is unclear!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/15/2006<br>Class Name: TDC464<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take this prof he sucks.

He gives a final exam that includes 20% of the grade on the last slides (over 100 slides). Was very unhelpful and unwilling to help students (when a group) approached to ask him a question. Doesn't bother curving. I got  B but I still think he was unfair and a very bad professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2004<br>Class Name: TDC363<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tests are harder then homework.
