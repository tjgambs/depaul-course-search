Prof. Sen makes what should be fun into a droll laborious process. She is completely humorless, inflexible,and teaches with a joyless seriousness. Shows only films with social &quot;messages&quot;. Do not EVER be late or leave early. Most classmates were dissapointed with Final class grades. Even other prof. warned me prior.Took this Fall 08.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/21/2009<br>Class Name: MCS270<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid this instructor.
