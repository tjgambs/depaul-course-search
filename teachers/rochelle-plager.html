I failed this class the previous quarter and took her because she gives homework from the book, not MathLab.

Anything I learned in this class I learned on my own. She doesn't explain things well and if you have a question she tells you to go to her office hours.

I've had her for the last two quarters, and I'm very pleased with her teaching style and her exams.  There is nothing on the exam that she does not go over in class. Don't miss class and you won't end up like the these unfortunate comments.

Very awkward mannerisms, but her lessons are nice to follow.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2012<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very difficult.  Picky on grading.  Didn't enter a single grade until long after I took the FINAL.  Prepare to learn from the book.  Lots of homework & attendance is mandatory.

She makes the weirdest jokes and giggles at her own words ALL THE TIME. It's crucial to attend her class or you'll fall behind. Her policy with collecting homework at the midterm is nice. She's easy to get along with. And as long as you do your homework and keep up in class. it'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2011<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Before coming to this class I was terrified because I hadn't really studied calculus but this class was not hard at all.

She does give ALOT of hw but she gives the answers to everything and homework is optional. If you do all the work you get extra points toward your final grade. She only gives a final and two tests, but takes the better of the two.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2011<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have never had such a horrible math teacher I am excellent at math and she made me hate math all together she basically tells you that if you have a job you cannot be in her class because her class is the most important thing in the world and you will basically fail if you don't devote the entire quarter to just her.. she is pathetic don't take h</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2011<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I wish I would have taken PLAGER first!!! I failed my first quarter of MAT 135 with another professor. Plager helped me actually understand the material. If you are terrible with math, she is the professor to take. I personally didn't take her because of the RMP rating but I wish I would have.

She must be tenured. there us no other way she would still be teaching here.

She gives a lot of homework but gives you all the answers, therefore the work is optional and you can get credit for copying her answers.  As long as you know the basic concepts the tests are easy, and you take two and she picks the better of the two.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2010<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The WORST teacher in the world. NEVER TAKE THIS CLASS. Assigns way too much homework and makes your life completely miserable.
