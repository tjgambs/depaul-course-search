He takes personal offense at disrespectful behavior from his students, whether it's complaining about the reading or being bored or anything, and he's 100% right. He is a great professor, and if you don't pay attention, you are missing a great opportunity to advance your writing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2014<br>Class Name: ENG221<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: WD</div><div id="right"><div>NOT HELPFUL</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2014<br>Class Name: ENG218<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't normally feel inclined to write reviews on here but after taking his class, I just needed to. He was an AMAZING professor. On the first day, he came off as a hardass but after that, he was extremely nice. He's very helpful and always listens to his student's ideas. I signed up for another one of his classes b/c he's so awesome! TAKE HIM!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/12/2013<br>Class Name: ENG218<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Ewell is great! yeah, you have to read and be prepared for class discussion, just like any English class, and when you are, it's a breeze. I really enjoyed the class as well as the class discussion. he's a no-nonesense kinda guy so don't expect to slack off and get an A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2013<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved going to this class. Professor Ewell always kept discussion interesting. There was not a lot of work outside of class. Aside from reading poems previous to class discussions, there were only two papers. I HIGHLY recommend taking a class with him, especially "Reading Poetry!"</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very smug english professor type.  very little to do with multiculturalism, very tough grader, assignments and exams are all written papers, grades for writing style and grammar, not ideas.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2012<br>Class Name: ENG245<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very Mediocre. Class is a bit dull and the novels aren't given their due. He's young and inexperienced, which explains his less than dynamic teaching methods.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2012<br>Class Name: ENG245<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't really enjoy this class because I felt like it was rushed. I also felt like we never got too in depth with the novels we were reading, and often found that I could get more information from Wikipedia or sparknotes. I usually don't use these resources, but I was so unsatisfied with the class discussions and analysis.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2011<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Ewell for my creative writing class. I liked the class overall and found it interesting, although he could try to make his students a bit more inspired since it is one of the first English major classes. He has a very dry personality, but my class had fun anyways and I liked that the atmosphere was always very light and comfortable.</div></div></div></body></html>
