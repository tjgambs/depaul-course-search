She knows what she is talking about not just because she is well read but also because she is passionate. I'm pretty &quot;left wing&quot; myself but for those who commented &quot;unless you are left wing don't take this class&quot; I would counter to say if you are not left wing definitely take this class. The truth hurts.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2007<br>Class Name: SCG406<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lipman is an interesting case because she's a tireless and effective crusader for social justice and equity in schools. I respected that. But she is also difficult, was unreliable for meetings, and seems to pick favorites at random. There wasn't even a rhyme to who she liked or why she did...not even based on effort. So worth taking BUT...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2006<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is very one-sided and makes you feel like an idiot for having any other views that don't coincide with hers.  class discussions are very tense and uncomfortable.  I agree she should stick to being a hardcore neo-marxist activist--she can't teach--this is the worst class I have ever taken at depaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2006<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst prof I ever had. Runs class discussions in way that she can totally control instead of way in which students can truly exchange and expand ideas. Claims to be open to all viewpoints, but clearly is not. Hurts her own arguments by not allowing other side of issue to even be discussed. Shouldn't be teaching, should just be social activist.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2006<br>Class Name: SCG<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was nice and very knowledgable.  Her style of teaching is very old fashion and not engaging.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2005<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Strengths: good reading list, prompt comments on papers, command of subject, big picture + details Weaknesses: all materails are strongly old-school Marxist, often lets chatty students blather on There was NOT a ton of reading. Modterate quantity, good quality, but all from one very narrow PoV. Students in the class were generally quite weak.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2005<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Lipman expanded my mind to think about the role of the educator:  as social institutions public schools help to shape our society (consider Brown vs. BOE); teachers are not drill sergeants but transformative intellectuals that do some of society's most important work.  These are the exciting concepts that Lipman covers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2005<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Lipman is brilliant and interesting however I would NOT recommend this class unless you're ready for a TON of very difficult academic reading and to be constantly put on the spot in class.  I felt sick to my stomach every class.  She is very passionate, and will cause you to doubt and make you feel bad for having any view that aren't like hers</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2005<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You will learn a ton in this class. You do a good ammount of reading but all very interesting and the class will open your eyes to new perspectives. Very helpful for being a future teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2005<br>Class Name: TL411<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's an accomplished researcher interested in examining how racial and social inequalities are reproduced in educational policy. Certain students are destined not to like her, but she is actually a very receptive if you aren't a glib thinker. Unfortunately, a lot of teaching students are lazy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2004<br>Class Name: EDUCATION<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a teacher who is unwilling to listen to student opinions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2004<br>Class Name: EDU101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor will change your life. She will challenge your views and your beliefs about education, and constantly encourage different approaches towards teaching for social justice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/08/2004<br>Class Name: SCU207<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm not sure who rated her 'Hot,' but she is Not.

She is an awesome professor. I guess if you aren't narrow minded you'll enjoy her class.  She is a fair grader and is very easy to understand. DEFINITELY take one of her class...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2004<br>Class Name: SCU207<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pauline is a good teacher if you have half a brain to understand her. Very informative and helps future teachers understand social issues that they will ber facing in the classroom. Also war on iraq stuff relates directly to its implications on teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2004<br>Class Name: SCU207<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought I was signing up for an education class, not a class on the war in Iraq.  She is a hard grader, unclear, and unwilling to listen to people's opinions (even though she tries to act like she does).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2003<br>Class Name: SCU207<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor was not willing to hear other view points besides her own.
