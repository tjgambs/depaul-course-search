He has a bit of an ego, but I think he knows it - which evens things out.  Don't expect him to hold your hand through the course.  He is not timely in responding to your questions/inquiries.  I passed the class with very little textbook reading, but I attended every lecture.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2009<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Uncle Monty is awesome!!!! I had him for LSP Discover Chicago City on the Lake at DePaul. It was the first time he taught it and he did very well!! Mostly did essay was a tough grader at first but he lets you revise the essay nad then uses that score!! Overall he was a greeat prof and person as well</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2009<br>Class Name: CSC261<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy teacher; Explains everything perfectly; Very beginner-friendly; funny at times; does not endorse participation much at all (I was never called on); No group work (YES); Can skip class if you please (but be sure to watch it online); Counts 2/3 tests, drops the third. Great overall.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2008<br>Class Name: TDC463<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the last thing you might wanna consider.No communication for as long as 4 to 5 day and most of the time NEVER!!.Slides are very hard to understand and he is very ignorent to a students problem.Its like ringing a bell infront of a deaf person.Dont take this class.Waste of money and time.Got nothing from this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2008<br>Class Name: TDC311<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher has no personality and this is bad because he doesn't take in consideration even if his whole class is doing terribly. He's slow on grades and you will never know your progress. He keeps things very complex and messy it's hard to learn from any of his material.  Stay away from this teacher, he lacks communication and many other factors</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2007<br>Class Name: CSC261<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy class.  Test questions can be a little tricky but just read the book and you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/06/2006<br>Class Name: XTDC363<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a easy class, but grad classes are not supposed to be easy.  however answers every question until you understand it, (if you ask them) and is always there after class and fast at responding to e-mails.  He did not do the homework grading and this made it hard as the grader was extremely strict...scrapped by with a solid B</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2006<br>Class Name: TDC463<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought he was very disorganized, often confused about the material himself, and overall a poor choice to teach this material.  Very difficult to learn from - seemed lost in his own little world.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2005<br>Class Name: ENV<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Relatively easy classes, just do your work and pay attention. Power points really help out. Get ready to stay 10-20 minutes after class is over. He just keeps on going with his lectures when class is up. Get on his good side too he seems kind of touchy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2005<br>Class Name: TDC365<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very reasonable guy!  Made a difficult class easier/clearer.  Exams were tough, but he'll work with you to get your grade up.  Labs were useless and a waste because he didn't explain them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2005<br>Class Name: ENV102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the most passionate professors I've encountered, but he is very difficult, and includes a lot of material in his class.  He should not be teaching introductory level classes, for non-majors.  Tests are very difficult and long, lectures are very in-depth.  But he is understanding, and will help you in any way he can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2004<br>Class Name: ENV<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a great teacher one of the best I ever had. He will help you with anything you need help on and he is very understanding. He tries so hard to make the class interesting and he teaches the subject very clearly</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2004<br>Class Name: DISCOVER<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>awesome teacher, very friendly, wants to help you. subjects he talks about get boring at times though.</div></div></div></body></html>
