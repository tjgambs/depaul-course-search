Assigns her own book for the class which has no national recognition and is a self indulgent bible for the class. Very close minded and stubborn in terms of accepting multiple approaches to education. Graded a paper of mine poorly based on my opinion rather than my actual work. Worst class and professor I've had.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2015<br>Class Name: SCU337<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OK so I understand you have to work for your grade in college but this woman takes it to a whole other level. There are discussion board posts, quizzes, bullet point summaries, reflection papers, field work observations and a whole lot of reading.  Take easy classes the quarter you take this class if you absolutely have to take her. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2014<br>Class Name: SCG439<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you don't seek to be a critical educator, then don't take this class. Dr. Brown tells it like it is some people don't want to face the facts about race so they find this course useless because they are not telling them exactly "how to teach" but the course requires you to be critical and that's hard for some people.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2014<br>Class Name: SCG439<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worse class ever.

You can miss only one class. Syllabus kept changing thus confusing to keep track of what mandatory readings were but it is not like we were quizzed on them. She is a very enthusiastic prof. and is willingly to take feedback throughout the course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2013<br>Class Name: SCG406<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ditto. It's almost entirely about racism and inequality. She assigns a ridiculous amount of reading and papers, but can't seem to get them graded and returned. Incredibly disorganized.  Unclear. She once passed me a note during a group presentation telling me to work on other work outside of class, but I WAS CHECKING SOMETHING IN MY CLASS NOTES!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2012<br>Class Name: SCG604<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Brown is one of the most intelligent people I have ever met, but she needs to clarify what she teaches. Interesting topics. Very disorganized. But she has a huge heart, really cares about her students (yet can't remember their names). Just relax when taking this class, she really does put an A- on almost anything.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/11/2011<br>Class Name: SCG439<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor I have ever had. I totally agree with comments that she doesn't teach, responds in an extremely rude manner, slaps an A- on your paper without explanation and over did very little teaching. Avoid this professor if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2011<br>Class Name: SCG604<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly as a professor, I thought she was pretty good. I got an A so, maybe my opinion is kind of biased. I definitely agree that race is her major focus. As an advisor she is the absolute worst. Do not request her as a faculty or thesis advisor. You will be working on your thesis until 2050 & your electives won't be approved.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/12/2011<br>Class Name: SCG439<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took her class three years ago and I still use the knowledge from her discussions today. I was just rereading one of the papers I wrote for her class and really appreciated the sophisticated lens that I was able to cultivate through her tutelage. Wanted to come on board and sing her praises, as I should have done years ago.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/02/2010<br>Class Name: CS580<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is absolutely HORRIBLE.  I was a grad student, and Dr. Brown was referred to me as a possible academic advisor for my graduate paper.  She was completely worthless, and even threatened not to graduate me, after attending several meetings and following her guidelines.  I ended up dropping her as my advisor and finding another. Avoid!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/24/2010<br>Class Name: SCG202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is hands down the worst teacher I have ever had including from my undergrad years.  She hardly responds to emails and when she does she is very rude.  Everything you see that people have posted on here, is true.  All you talk about is race and gender....not how to teach middle school students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2010<br>Class Name: SCG439<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She doesn't teach.  As has been previosuly mentioned, she cancels several classes.  There is little actual work to do, but she will give you an A- on everything.  Total waste of money.  Only take this professor if you don't want to do any work/learn anything, and don't mind having an A- slapped on everything you turn in with the same vague comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2009<br>Class Name: SCU339<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE. Please do not take her if you can avoid it. She assigns readings that are ridiculous, does not discuss them. Group projects that she gave about 10 minutes of class to work on and the rest of the time we had to fit group meetings into our busy schedules. This class is a complete waste of time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/21/2009<br>Class Name: SCG439<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst class ever!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/10/2009<br>Class Name: SCG439<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst teacher I have EVER had. Only talks about race, assigns so many reading, essays,and projects, that you can't take any other classes or have a life outside of her class. Cancels half the classes, but assigns double the work. Completely unreasonable. Do not take this class if you can avoid it, it teaches you NOTHING about teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2008<br>Class Name: SCG439<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked Dr. Brown.

She was pleasant and intelligent.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2008<br>Class Name: SCU339<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst professor I've ever had at DePaul. She really does not care about the students..she gives every single person in the class an A- on every paper and every assignment.. makes you are wasting your money. For an easy A, take this class. For a stimulating education class that will give you tools for being a teacher, steer clear.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2008<br>Class Name: SCG439<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was ok... seems like her attitude has changed from the past comments.  She expects a lot but she's fair, she never once put us down or cut us off to interject her own views.  There is nothing to fear by taking her... my A- was a fair grade...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/10/2008<br>Class Name: SCG439<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class consisted of a lot of reading, writing papers, and presentation preparation.  With the readings, at first hard to navigate through the Victorian text, but later understood.  Hated the first week, but really began to understand why she assigned the readings. Learned a lot about history, how it is represented in society and schools today.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2007<br>Class Name: SCG439<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Was more concerned about race relations then education.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2007<br>Class Name: SCG439<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was the worst professor I have had during both my undergraduate and graduate school experiences.  She &quot;graded&quot; papers in front of us during class, essentially drawing lines down the right side and placing whatever grade she felt like at the end.  Always late, and only &quot;talked at us&quot;.  I think it was the biggest waste of $3,000 I had to spend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2007<br>Class Name: SCG403<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWFUL TEACHER EASY A- All other post are 100% on.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2007<br>Class Name: SCG406<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof has a clear agenda, RACE!! Child development takes a back seat to what it's like to grow up Black. She alienates a large portion of her students with her radical, racially motivated comments. The only purpose she serves is to set an example of what a HORRIBLE TEACHER is!!!!!!! It's really a shame DePaul allows her to educate future teachers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2007<br>Class Name: SCG403<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She doesn't read the papers.

However, she did not teach the curriculum of childhood development. We didn't even talk about theories. Which makes the APT difficult. She also has many group presentations so she only teaches about 2 total classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2007<br>Class Name: SCG439<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely awful!  The WORST teacher I have ever had - lectures vaguely and is late every day (Keeps us late to make up for that).  The class is supposed to be about education in middle school and not just about race!!!  I wish I would have read the other reviews before partaking in the section that she was teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/19/2007<br>Class Name: SCG439<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Brown is amazing.

I don't believe all of her students come in with a background so they can't call her on things. She cites court cases wrongly. Her history is wrong.

I'm not sure that she &quot;picks on students she doesn't like,&quot; so much as her course deals with the very sensitive issues of race, class and sexuality; these happen to be issues we'll have to deal with as teachers, so if Dr. Brown made you uncomfortable you may want to rethink your career goals.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/12/2005<br>Class Name: SCU339<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/11/2005<br>Class Name: SCG<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Always late.
