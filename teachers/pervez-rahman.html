He teaches at a very slowly pace that occasionally tests your patience, but he does it for a reason.  His jokes are bad, but that's what makes them funny.

Bad: I didn't like his jokes, and many stories (perhaps you will though) and I was frustrated because we didn't get to practice many problems in class because he talked so much. I feel like he tries to get you to like him, and that really irritated me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2011<br>Class Name: MATH160<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WONDERFUL Professor.

This is actually a pretty tough course and some kids really struggled with the concepts and what not.

It had been a while since my undergrad so I was worried about going back to grad school. Professor Rahman is very knowledgeable, will go out of his way to explain problems, and is very fair in his grading/testing.

Involved students in problems and examples. Went over homework if you had questions but not graded. A one question quiz at the end of each class that you could take with a 'neighbor'. Really just a stand-up who wants to see his students succeed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2011<br>Class Name: MATH610<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had this professor for math 610 and 611.  He was extremely professional and his teaching methods were effective.  I highly recommend him.  Please remember that if you are in a grad-level class you must have some basic knowledge of the material.  The professor effectively and professionally keeps the students engaged and interested on the subject.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2011<br>Class Name: MATH611<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He not only taught the material effectively, he was able to keep the students engaged and interested on the subject matter professionally.

He is a nice person, but his teaching is horrible. He assumes that if you are in graduate school that you know everything there is to know about Calc. He doesn't go over the concepts at all and jumps right into the exercises. The sad part is there is no way to avoid him so be prepared.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2010<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Dr. Rahman's MAT101 after not taking a math class in over 10 years(I'm in the SNL program for Adults) and when I saw he was teaching MAT130, I signed up immediately. He went over the material thoroughly and always stopped to explain whenever things got difficult. I definately recommend taking his class. It's prepared me for MAT135.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/12/2010<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take him!!! he is incredible!

He teaches because he loves to not because he has to. He was always helpful when someone did not understand the material. I really struggle in math but he really helped me understand. Please dont take this class if you just want an easy grade.It requires work and effort. If your willing to do that you will befine</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2010<br>Class Name: MTH101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Rahman was very explanatory...almost too explanatory.  It was intermediate algebra which I took in high school so maybe that's why I think this but I think the class could have been done in half the time.  Makes you feel comfortable and (tries) to joke alot, which makes class go by fast.  I'd recommend him...homework is online, tests easy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2009<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i honestly in the beginning found his teaching to be a bit degrading, he went through every step and it was hard to follow because he took so long getting through one problem. its easy to get bored and distracted that way. i ended up using the homework to teach myself half of the material. he's a nice guy but not a great teacher for this class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2009<br>Class Name: MATH101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's not a bad teacher, but also not great, He's very into math though. He came across as extremely arrogant and pompous. Class isn't too hard but, He's not very helpful when you come to him with questions(kind of talks down to you like your an idiot) so your basically on your own if you get stuck.

Even though I earned an &quot;A&quot; out of your class, I spent many hours completing homework and reteaching myself the material you though you taught the class. I found your teaching sometimes very difficult to follow.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2007<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You don't have to come to class but it's best to since only exams and quizzes are graded.

Multiple choice exams are given, don't get too excited, thely are difficult because credit is all or nothing, the work used to achieve an answer is not taken into account.

He makes random jokes and tells funny stories in class all the time. IF you laugh that can help raise your grade and you don't have to turn in your homework.

He's tough, yes, but he assumes that students first have some understanding of math and like to be challenged. He's a Dean of Math at another school, so he must know something more than those who can't appreciate his talents. I passed with a C, but I'm not complaining.

Prof is Dean of Math @ Chicago City Colleges, is moonlighting @ DePaul to keep his teaching certs up. Not terribly invested in students. If you're in MAT130, it's because you need it.

Wouldn't recommend taking him if you're worried about your GPA, really hard to get an A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2003<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fun teacher for an 8:30 AM class.  I do agree with the previous person that I wish he would do homework checks because with only two tests worth 30% and then the final, it really sucks.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2003<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>pretty good teacher for an 8:30 am class. Only problem...only two tests...both worth 30% each...and than a final worth 40%...but doesnt do homework checks...and all tests are scantron..depends on your learning style, but a nice and funny teacher to have.</div></div></div></body></html>
