Overall not a bad instructor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2012<br>Class Name: REL229<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was weighed heavily on class participation. The material was very repetitive and at times, VERY boring. In my opinion, Dialogue Initiators were a waste of time and "elementary school work." Dr. Ward was also not tentative to her emails which made it difficult to find out answers form her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2012<br>Class Name: REL229<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mrs. Ward was a very nice woman and the class was wonderful overall...a summary of the reading is due every week and one presentation that is easy overall. Also, the discussions were very interesting if you read the book</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2012<br>Class Name: REL229<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a sweet woman who's class I found interesting. The subject matter seems to get repetitive and boring by the end of the quarter,though. There are Dialogue Initiators required for every class (1 page, SINGLE spaced) which aren't bad and a group project/presentation. Participation is required.  Overall, not bad. Easy 'A'. Take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2012<br>Class Name: REL229<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Attendance/ Participation is of the UTMOST importance.She is a very nice woman, but she's disorganized. for this ethics class, all we had to do was a 1 page summary of the readings for every class. Not bad. The class presentation is a big part of the grade. if you can keep yourself on track, take the class and get an easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2007<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An absolutely wonderful lady.  Very honest and open to different opinions in the classroom.  A little spacy at times, but don't hold that against her.  She's a pretty decent grader is is very approachable and sweet.  Just a really genuine person.  Take her if you get the chance</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2007<br>Class Name: REL237<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is kind of spece cadet.

Very nice lady, very boring class and book, she changed the syllabus to accommodate the class' interests. You do a lot of writing, not much guidance on the assignments.

The worst professor ever and deaf.  Never take your opinion inconsideration, instead re-words it and completely change the meaning to it.  Waste of money and time.  Cannot calculate grades.

She was simply terrible... very disorganized, didn't grade on the quality of work.  She's confusing and impatient, and just downright BORING.

Her lectures were uninspired, her asssignments were extremely vague, and grading was arbitrary, with no feedback provided on papers.

I don't know why people have rated her as being so nice...I find her hard to talk to after class and just weird.  The woman is so disorganized too.
