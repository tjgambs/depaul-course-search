Expect homework and lots of it. If you do ALL of the homework, you'll be fine on the quizzes and exams. There is also a proof presentation part of the overall grade. If you practice the proof before you present to her you'll be fine. She's a good professor and she really prepares students for advanced math. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2015<br>Class Name: 215260262<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: D</div><div id="right"><div>Kashina is an amazing person and professor. She is willing to explain something to you over and over again until you get it. You must take time out of your day to do her work and truly understand it or else you will not pass her class. Do her homework and do good on her quizzes, you'll be fine. Just try your best. She is tough, but Very helpful!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2014<br>Class Name: MAT215MAT260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is hard. They are both hard subjects. But she is more than willing to help you out and really good at explaining things over again. She goes over homework. Lots of examples. Really nice and friendly and funny. You just really have to at least try and put in some effort. If you get behind like I did she will help prepare you for the final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2013<br>Class Name: MAT398<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2012<br>Class Name: MATH261<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've taken her for many classes, I would recommend her to anyone! She is great in her lecture, and the material on the quizes and exams is covered clearly in class and in the homework problems she chooses. If I could, I would take her for every math class! She is great!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2012<br>Class Name: MATH261<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is amazing, and her quizes and tests are very fair. As long as you understand the practice problems in class and do the homework!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2010<br>Class Name: MATH150<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've taken Calc 1 and 2 previously at a different college and had a lot of difficulty with it. This time around I had someone that actually showed examples and went over things step by step so you could get it. She gives partial if you try and tells you ahead of time what to look out for. Overall good teacher in my opinion</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2010<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tries to be helpful and classes mostly devoted to lectures or reviewing difficult problems. Doesn't really break it down. You're gonna need to devote your own time to teaching yourself and the homework. The book is difficult to follow, so try and look online or the math tutors for detailed questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2010<br>Class Name: MATH231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher! She will really make you work for your grade. If you are going to take ANY math course, suggest just taking ONE. Don't take another course ,like accounting, at the same time. You will spend a lot of time in her class. She will go out of her way to help you. Hard to understand and read notes, but in the end you get what you deserve!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/05/2009<br>Class Name: MAT260<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher. Not always the most exciting night class but she was a good teacher. She was a pretty easy grader, its always better to attempt a problem then to not right anything you'll almost always get partial credit.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2008<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOMEEEEEEEEEEE</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2008<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful teacher. The course is supposed to be difficult for incoming freshmen but i think she is the best in the deptartment. She usually drops quiz grades, offers extra credit, and helps alot for exams. She goes out of her way to help out. Deifnilty take her class if you have the option.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2008<br>Class Name: MAT160<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>her lectures put me to sleep</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2008<br>Class Name: MAT303<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>not the best</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2007<br>Class Name: MAT303<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her for 215 and then took 303 because I liked her so much. Kashina is the reason I'm a math major. Nicest, most helpful prof I've had. Lectures can be boring. Really cares about her students. Weekly quizzes so your grade isnt dependant on one big test. Take her if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2006<br>Class Name: MAT140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took her class in Fall/2005 and didn't know what to expect. You work hard for your grade, however, she offers various extra credit opportunities for those in need. She's very helpful and really nice. She's an extremely intelligent person and she's great at what she does. I adore her! Her jokes, though not funny, make you smile anyway. TAKE HER!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2006<br>Class Name: MAT140141<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Realy cares about her subject. She realy makes you wan to understand. Trys to be funny sometimes... it's kinda cute. I LOVE HER ACCENT!!!(very russian if you couldn't tell from the name)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2005<br>Class Name: DISMATH140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love her... but that is not to say her class is easy.  It is ALOT of work but it all is relevant.  The homework and practice are on the quiz and the questions from the quiz are on the midterm and final. I agree with the previous comment, her actually taking the time to answer your questions says alot about her as a teacher. Definitely take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2005<br>Class Name: DISCRETEMATH<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love her.  She is generally concerned and that really helps me get through the material.  To know that I can ask her for help on a math problem and she will help you so you CAN understand it and not just shaking your head in agreement... that says alot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2005<br>Class Name: MAT161<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hated this class...could not get a hold on it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2005<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really respect her knowledge, but she makes her class the way too hard. Her tests are too long to finish on time. She is always ready to help after class thought. So, I would say she is 50/50</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/19/2005<br>Class Name: MAT140260310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Kashina is VERY nice and helpful. I went to her office almost everyday. I loved how she was concerned with everyone's grade, especially with Abstract Algebra. Homework counted for half our grade, which was helful. I wish I had more classes with her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2005<br>Class Name: MAT311<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is one of the best professors at DePaul.

I even schedule my classes around what she's teaching just to make sure i have her as a teacher. she's very helpful and willing to have study sessions. I would DEFINITELY recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2004<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great teacher, will help you out of class whenever you want, gives you a lot of help, highly recommended</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2004<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is definately one of the better math teachers I have had.
