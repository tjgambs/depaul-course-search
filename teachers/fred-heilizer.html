If he thinks you're not paying attention he will kick you out of class. His lectures are not interesting. He contradicts himself and the book. There were surprise questions on exams from material that had not been covered. He is right, you are wrong.

Yes it is true that he is really bad with technology, and he does ramble on about other things, but i found them interesting. His papers were easy to do and the tests are more focused from the book than his lectures. He is a very nice man and I would take him again</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2013<br>Class Name: PSY351<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His knowledge is outdated. He was often late and contradicted what the book was saying which made it very hard to study for the test... I could not hear him and I sat in the first row. He would often mumble and lose track of his thoughts.

It is almost impossible to get less than an A on every test, since he curves them all like 20 points extra. I got over 100 on every test. He is definitely a character, and tells funny stories. I liked him alot! He is horrible with technology though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2013<br>Class Name: PSY351<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Contradicts the book and says he's right.  Tests are based off book and lecture, even though we were told we didn't need the book. Doesn't know how to use technology, especially D2L.  You may get a grade lower than what you earned because he won't try to fix it. Doesn't like to be wrong. Easy A if you study, semi-boring lectures. Good luck.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2013<br>Class Name: PSY357<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Literally forgot our final. He had to go down and make copies so we started our final 20mins late. When he finally brought them half of the class was missing a page of the test. His response? We'll figure it out. Avoid this professor if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2013<br>Class Name: PSY351<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My Theories of Personality course was the most disappointing experience that I have had during my education at DePaul. Professor Heilizer did not have a clear or coherent pedagogy in his approach to teaching this class.  His lectures are meandering, & his interest in teaching the course is the same as that of a student checking Facebook in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2013<br>Class Name: PSY351<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you like disorganized teaching styles and instead teaching yourself the material then this is the professor for you. Many comments here state that the tests in this class are easy and I hope their right. In an hr and a half we only covered 3 of Freud's psychosexual stages. For a level 300 class I expected so much more. Moves way too slow on material everyone should have covered in intro classes and 200 classes. Teaching materials are out of date.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2013<br>Class Name: 351201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interesting.

Ridiculous at times but definitely knows his stuff and has many experiences to share. If you are a dedicated student and actually make the effort to attend an $800 class you are paying for, you'll be fine. Talks on the quiet side so it's difficult to hear him. Papers were super easy.

He is impossible to hear, doesn't care about his students at all, tests are very hard, makes it impossible to meet outside of class, gives zeros on papers that are fully completed and is just plain rude.  Psych 106 would've been a great class with another professor.

Hands down the WORST class I have ever taken. HE IS BEYOND BORING, the info that takes him an hour to explain took 10 minutes in intro! He rambles, and I sat in the 2nd row and could barely hear him.

He's not willing to help you outside of class AT ALL and he judges you by the papers you write. Not a hard grader, but he seriously can't teach.

He spends half of the class trying to figure out how to maximize windows on the computer.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2010<br>Class Name: PSY351<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly he is the worst prof. I've ever had. I looked at his ratings on here prior to taking the course, and figured that it couldn't possibly be THAT bad. But let me assure you, it's WORSE. The man gives you the same lecture on Freud 3 days in a row, &can spend the entire class explaining two concepts that should have taken 5 min.

Unfortunately, he is creepy, he talks about his own sex life (in detail) and he makes facts up.  It seems like he talks about what he feels like, even if it is not necessarily true.

Also, he demands respect but does not respect his students. i got yelled at for being late when I wasn't - he just couldn't hear me because he is ancient.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2006<br>Class Name: PSY302<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is an asowme teacher..show up on time in class everyday...talk little and write 3 paper (now i admit 6-12 pages is very long but EASY)it's very easy to get an A in his class i don't know y student don't appriciate easy classes</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2005<br>Class Name: PSY351<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Let's clarify something: If you are consistently late to class, disruptive, or generally act like a deadbeat then OF COURSE he isn't going to be nice to you! All the people that he was rude to were either punks or airheads. If you show up to class on time and pay attention he's a pretty cool guy. He also curves very generously</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2005<br>Class Name: PSYCH302<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>These people are all so mean! Fred is the sweetest thing. It's like being taught by your grandpa. He's extremely knowledgeable about psychology and I've taken multiple classes with him because he's interesting, funny, easy, and fair. If you go to class and do what's asked, you should receive an A..... just like every other class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: THEORIESOFPER<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ABSOLUTELY AVOID His Class!!!

He was laid back and his lectures were full of video clips. Despite the long class, it was not hard to stay awake. There were two multiple-choice tests, no homework and a GREAT curve. It's virtually impossible to get less than a C.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2005<br>Class Name: PSYCHOLOGY<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He has deep-seated issues and he will take them out on you. He wears five watches. He will not tollerate cell phones being turned off or pens being dropped. If you like the discomfort of listening to the dilusional ranting of a mental patient mixed with the structure of a kindergarten class with the stress of a mine field than take his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2005<br>Class Name: PSY351<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think,he is a good professor. I enjoy having him as a teacher. He is knowledgeable, and I leraned a lot in his class.True, sometimes the class is boring, but he is not mean or evil as other have said.

I loved the field trips, the in class movies, The Wild One and Evil Kanevil, and the book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintainance.

Fred is kind of scary at first, but as time goes on, he tends to be an ok guy.  Grading is extremely fair from my experiences, due to the curve he gives on the exams.  The class can be funny at time, and extremely boring at most.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2005<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Consider ANY other professor. SERIOUSLY, god. I don't usually have a problem with professors, but anyone who trails off like he does, and ends with &quot;and stuff like that&quot; when he can't remember what he was just talking about should give up teaching. Freaking mumbles and treats you like a two year old.

If you have to take his class, do not take it at night. You will most likely fall asleep and then he will make you wish you were never born. Two people actually came close to tears because of him.
