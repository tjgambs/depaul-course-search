Even though the class material was condensed, he made it an enjoyable class through his positive energy and motivational teaching style. He has such high respect for his students and If you you were to learn one thing from his classes, it's that learning is endless!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2015<br>Class Name: SEV611<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the Professors that "gets it." No busy work, no BS. Professional class, fair grading. Always brings in great guest lecturers and keeps the class interesting. Really great real-world type lessons. I highly suggest his courses. Wish more Professors were like him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2015<br>Class Name: ACC525<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's awesome :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2014<br>Class Name: SEV621<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Frigo is no doubt one of the best professors I've ever had (both in MBA and undergrad).  Take him for as many classes as you can!  His projects are rather detailed and a lot to get done in (4) 8-hour sessions but it is very attainable as long as you work together with your group.  He wants you to succeed and is there for you if you need help. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/15/2014<br>Class Name: SEV621<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The SEV concentration is the best way to blend AND complement skills found in finance, accounting, valuation, strategic planning, etc. into a set of frame works/tools that allow you to take on the challenges of leading any organization.  The courses are administered by business leaders, clinical professors and leading researchers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/13/2014<br>Class Name: SEV641<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr Frigo is the BEST professor at DePaul. He is very intelligent and tries very hard to share his knowledge with his students. Dr. Frigo is caring and wants the best from his student. I highly recommend Dr. Frigo. He has a very positive attitude and i really enjoyed taking his classes. He is hands down the best professor at DePaul</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/12/2014<br>Class Name: SEV611<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great course to start off the MBA program.  It should be a mandatory "core" course instead of a concentration course.  Dr. Frigo and Return Drive Strategy challenge you to think differently. The things you learn in class will apply to your career as well as the rest of the MBA program.  I would highly recommend taking this sooner than later.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2013<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Accounting is not for the faint of heart. Dr. Frigo's class will keep you informed, entertained, and enlightened - or at least moreso than any other professor I've encountered. Textbook is used heavily but Driven book is not. If you're not savvy or experienced in accounting, prepare to teach yourself quite a bit.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2013<br>Class Name: GSB599<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was nothing more than a 4-day seminar on his book, Driven. It contains no actual wisdom or anything applicable to a real life situation - just vague points that sound nice, like a fortune cookie. I don't care how funny he is or how much karate he shows us. A roomful of near-MBA's should not be forced to help this man promote his book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/21/2013<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr Frigo is fantastic. He's inspiring and clear - he makes a traditionally boring topic fun and engaging. His exams are very representative of prior material. I plan on taking him for as many classes as possible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2013<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Frigo made the class one of the most enjoyable classes I have had a DePaul.

He is the definition of a great teacher. He's inspiring and humorous in a subject that lacks both concepts. Take if you're not concentrating in accounting. My only concern is the amount of actual material we went over in class. It seemed like we covered 2 simple concepts per class and that was that.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2013<br>Class Name: ACC798<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Frigo's SEV concentration is excellent.  Out of all my courses at Depaul these courses have prepared me for management the most.  It was an excellent learning experience being a team leader and learning to adapt and be prepared instead of making excuses.  I feel more confident in team settings and presentations at work now.  Great concentration</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2013<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Quality, right here.  Great guy, very clear and straight forward.  I really looked forward to attending his class each week, I found it informative and entertaining at the same time (not only is he an accounting wiz, he's also a karate guru). The classroom is the dojo!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2013<br>Class Name: ACCT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr.Frigo is the most inspiring individul. He is the best professor at DePaul. He has such a positive impact on his students and he does an excellent job about keeping the class engaged. His goal is always to make sure his students are learning and getting the most out of the class. If you have to take an Acct class, you MUST take Dr. Frigo.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2013<br>Class Name: GSB621<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Frigo is THE best professor at DePaul.  His SEV classes are unlike any other classes offered in the program.   He is a dynamic professor who doesn't just read off of powerpoint slide but instead brings real life experience and examples to support what he is teaching.  DePaul is lucky to have such a professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2012<br>Class Name: SEV611<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Frigo's SEV courses are the best courses offered at DePaul.

Made the topic straightforward and interesting. There is some work involved if you are new to the topic but he spells out what will be on the exams.

He made the topic real easy to understand and although I have no intention of being an accountant I learned a lot that I know will stay with me. He keeps the class interesting and you know exactly what to expect on the tests. I heard great things about him before I took the class and I am really glad I listened.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2012<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's way overrated. Nice guy, nice class. ACC is boring especially managerial because who the heck cares about manufacturing anyway. He does his best to make a very boring topic interesting. Only mid term and final with optional EC assignment. His SEV stuff is way more interesting than "T" charts</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2012<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor, Great Class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2011<br>Class Name: SEV611<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Frigo's graduate course on Return Driven Strategy is one of the best courses in the MBA program.

But I dont think we learned much at all, and one of the least useful classes.  But he did make accounting more interesting with his martial arts moves</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2011<br>Class Name: SEV611<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best classes and best professors I have ever had.

Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2011<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Frigo not only teaches well, but also makes the class extremely entertaining as there was never a dull moment.  I would recommend his class for all skill levels.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2011<br>Class Name: SEV621<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class covers the tenets of the Strategic Risk Management Framework, similar to the Return Driven Strategy Framework taught in SEV611. Dr. Frigo, who wrote both books for both classes, is an unforgettable and inspiring professor who brings real world experience, and is a refreshing change from the typical professors in a graduate-level setting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2011<br>Class Name: SEV611<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class covers the tenets of the Return Driven Strategy Framework, a holistic approach to strategy for any position within any organization, and is taught by this professor who wrote the book, DRIVEN, on the framework. Dr. Frigo is a dynamic, engaging teacher who brings a structured approach to class (seminar style) and real world experience!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/15/2011<br>Class Name: SEV611<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Every MBA student should take at least one of the SEV classes. You get the feeling that Dr. Frigo really enjoys teaching and he has great real world busines examples, brings sr.executives from Fortune 100 companies to guest lecture, and it's a great learning experience. In this class you will practice leadership, teamwork, and communication skills.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/14/2011<br>Class Name: SEV621<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Finally a common sense approach to apply a strategic framework. Dr. Frigo teaches this class as the second part of his stratgey program. The class happens over two weekends, is fast paced, and also has a strong group work portion where you apply what you have learned. If you do the work in and out of class, you will learn a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/14/2011<br>Class Name: SEV611<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr Frigo does an excellent job with this class. It is taught over two weekends and provides a lot of information, a group case to not only apply what you learned, but it also serves to show that you did indeed learn it. Frigo did an awesome job developing and evolving the class and if you do the work in and out of class you can learn a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/14/2011<br>Class Name: SEV621<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The Book &quot;Driven&quot; co-written by Dr. Mark Frigo is by far and away the best book an MBA student will read at DePaul.  The class takes real world business examples and articulates how a company ethically maximizes wealth.  Dr. Frigo is passionate and genuinely cares about the student experience.  The SEV program is highly recommended to MBA students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/04/2011<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class, and incredibly straightforward.  He is funny and interesting (especially amazing for accounting), and he lets you go early almost every class.  I recommend him highly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2011<br>Class Name: ACC798<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Inflate your GPA with SEV classes. Show up and you will get an A. All group work, so if that isn't your style don't worry because most MBAs are willing to do 90% of the work. Do just enough so they don't slam you in peer reviews. Take the weekend format to get it over with quickly with no work and an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2011<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. Very accomplished. The textbook is absolutely required. Exam question are near-verbatim from the book and in chapter order! As long as you work through the book exercises, you'll be good. Exams are long, but predictable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2011<br>Class Name: ACCT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Frigo provides an interesting learning environment, one that keeps the students awake and involved.  He incorporates real world material and cases, and at the same time, stresses the key concepts for each topic.  He provides exceptional material, online and copy, and he's always well prepared.  I highly recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2011<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>When you think of accounting, you think of debits & credits, T-accounts & financial statements.  But in Dr. Frigo's class, you will be thinking Karate & Bruce Lee.  Dr. Frigo has an incredible ability to make accounting exciting.  I attended as a part-time student and after work, it was so refreshing to sit in his class for a few hours.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2011<br>Class Name: ACCT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Frigo has a great passion for teaching.  I was dreading taking this class, but he made it very easy for non-accounting/finance folks to understand and apply. His humor and personal stories make the class fun too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2011<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Frigo is/was a great professor, he keeps class interesting, keeps you engaged for the 3 hours, & actually teaches you the material.  I can honestly say that I knew more about the subject after each class than I did when I walked in.  You are going to have to study for the MT & Final but he the tests are fair and from the lecture.  Highly Rec'd!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/03/2010<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor!  I was not looking forward to this course, as I did not enjoy financial accounting, but Dr. Frigo made the class as enjoyable as possible.  He truly has a passion for teaching and does everything he can to help you learn.  The karate keeps the mood light and wakes you up amidst the boredom of accounting.  I would highly recomme</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/23/2010<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am actually pleased to have had the opportunity to have Dr. Frigo. Had I had someone teach managerial accounting the way he did when I was an undergrad, I would have probably double majored in accounting. He is thorough, no non-sense, fair and most importantly has a passion for teaching. Truly, if you can take him, you will enjoy the experience.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2010<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Total egomaniac who talks more about karate than accounting.

Not the greatest teaching style as he only reads from his textbook and makes you do problems but he does care about his students and will answer any questions with detail. If you're good at memorizing his problems, you'll get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2010<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't learn much from his class.

Class consists of him reading out of his textbook (you have to buy from Lulu & can't resell) and leaving the room while you do problems.I had to teach myself outside of class.The content is easy, but poorly explained.Exams are somewhat similar to textbook, but not exact like promised.Nice guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2009<br>Class Name: GSB611<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a completely pointless class. If you want the insights from the book, read the book. Don't spend tuition dollars on it. It's very easy but it's not worth the money spent.

He manages to make a 20 minute lecture turn into a 2.5 hour ordeal due to Bruce Lee and karate references.  Very easy class, but you'd be better served taking an accounting class where you're actually required to learn something.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/18/2009<br>Class Name: GSB621<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think most people that are critical of Dr. Frigo are missing the point of learning.  If you just want an A and don't want to learn, don't bother taking this class.  Frigo preaches simplicity and this class is the epitome of it as far as Risk Valuation goes.  Probably one of the biggest assets of Kellstadt is having him on staff.

Ridiculous curve.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/03/2008<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fun professor.

The class is pretty easy as long as you study. He tells you EXACTLY what pages to focus on. A big change from ACC 500. I had no idea MBA classes would be this easy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/20/2008<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You will learn more about karate than about accounting.  He tells you most of what is going to be on the test but there are some trickery there. His book is festered with errors, misspelling and grammar issues. And I aggree with the previous comment about his personality and ego.  ughhhhhhh Class grade is curved and lots of bonus points.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2008<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The only thing larger than his ego is his arrogance. He has a n &quot;in class&quot; persona and no personality out of the classroom unless he can gain something from the relationship.  He tells you exactly what is on the tests (mid term & final) you do not need to learn anything it is pure memorization, some of the question on the test is from his notes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2008<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As someone who came to Kellstadt with zero accounting experience prior to ACC500 (a nightmare with Shannon), this class clearly set expectations of content coverage and testing.  Topics were boiled down to a level of simplicity that made understanding very easy.  There was no test trickery and class discussion included application into actual work</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2008<br>Class Name: GSB621<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was the most useless class I have ever taken - BUT it was a Friday/Saturday class and it couldnt have been easier if you were in 3rd grade.

Hadn't taken an accounting course since undergrad sophomore year...ie, 8 years ago (yikes!)  the material wasn't easy but he was a great teacher.  Dr. Frigo tells you exactly what to study.  Don't get the textbook...95% of the material you need is in the course packet.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2007<br>Class Name: GSB611<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Frigo is a great professor at DePaul.  I rate him easy due to how well he teaches the material. I have taken him for ACC 555 and all 3 SEV courses.  I have learned a tremendous amount from him and would HIGHLY recommend taking his courses if you really want to learn something.  If you just want to an A without thinking, don't bother.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2007<br>Class Name: ACCT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>M.

He can get easily sidetracked because he tends to be big picture and not much for details.  He does want to see his students succeed, but has a tear-down rebuild approach.  Attempts to be objective, but has subjective opinions about some authors; he tries to persuade you that he is the authority.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2005<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a ego centric.  He teaches you how to pass the class and if you are smart enough, how to interpret it into the real world.
