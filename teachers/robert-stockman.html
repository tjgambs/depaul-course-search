Dr. Stockman is a very good professor.  Pretty straightforward class, but attendance is important.  Dr. Stockman is also a very interesting, kind man.  Would recommend taking any of his religion classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/03/2010<br>Class Name: REL103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A great Prof. He allows you to make up ur midterm by writing a 10 page paper if u do poor on it. Midterm and final are exactly identical. Your given 10 people, places, things, etc. and 3 essays to write. Also if you take him he makes u write 2 papers. Cares for students. He will take phone calls on the weekends if u need help or have &#63;'s</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2010<br>Class Name: REL103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice professor. Very lenient with deadlines for papers. Does not assign a burdening amount of work at all. Gives study guides for the midterm and final. Fairly easy grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2009<br>Class Name: REL111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was expecting this class to be awful, but I ended up with a B just by showing up and putting together long enough papers. He's a really sweet man but his lectures get tiring. He didn't care when people showed up late, but just don't miss class. Overall, he's a very smart many who really knows his stuff, class was just boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2008<br>Class Name: REL111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall very interesting class.  Could be a bit boring at times, and the reading is a little much.  But he wants you to do well and gives you every opportunity to do well.  He lets you turn your papers in late if needed, and will read your outlines.  Don't miss class though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2008<br>Class Name: REL111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice guy, not too much work, gives extensions on papers, Very helpful. Some of his classes can be a bit boring (i.e. not the most interesting speaker) but overall a good prof. and knows his stuff about rel. I would definitely recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2008<br>Class Name: REL111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He used Wikipedia articles a little too often in his lectures. Definitely needs to update his notes, he's been using the same ones for like ten years now. overall, he's a pretty good guy who gives just a little bit too much reading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2008<br>Class Name: REL103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interesting class. His lectures are interesting because he uses many examples from his trips to places. DO NOT BUY THE BOOK. DOESN'T USE IT AT ALL. Just print the notes form blackboard, and you'll be fine.  Class is easy. Two papers and two exams are required.  The only bad thing is that he keeps lecturing 9 on a dot. Highly recommended class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2007<br>Class Name: REL103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice man, but absolutely the most boring lectures.  Constantly off topic, unclear lecture.  If you are looking for a class to make your ears bleed, well then this is the class for you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2007<br>Class Name: REL103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teacher is very felxable with papers. Two 5pg papers and midterm and final. Attendance is mandatory allows one. I found myself very bored in his class, talks to much about his travels which waist class time. He just rambles the whole three hours and never lets us out early. Not such a hard class, so if you don't mind being bored its okay.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2007<br>Class Name: REL103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>nice guy, bad teacher. Uses wikipedia alot, never uses book in class. Hard grader, expects perfection on exams, even though the answer is correct, but not what he wanted SO ITS WRONG. Rambles on about his travels and bores the class. DONT take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2007<br>Class Name: REL103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man's lectures only revolve around his travels aroung Europe. Most of his information is derived from wikipedia, not the expensive textbook. Plus, his voice is monotone and low. In addition he is an unfair graded. So beware, students. Do not take this class at all. It will just cause you a millions of headaches!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2007<br>Class Name: REL105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very nice man, and loves this subject. But he is not the best teacher, he teaches off wikipedia and does not use the book to much, He is also a very hard grader, nothing is every what he wants you to write. Class is very boring also.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2007<br>Class Name: REL103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know about this guy. He knows his stuff, but I think he knows too much. If your interested in Religion take him you'll lear alot, but if not, find a different teacher. He is not clear on what he wants on test and 1/2 the class failed the midterm. DO NOT BUY THE BOOK, puts all the notes online. SUPER EASY/FLEXIBLE ON DEAD LINES &PAPER DOOVER</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2007<br>Class Name: REL123<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a really nice guy. His class is kinda boring, but if you do the reading and study for stuff, it's fine. he'll easily give you an extra week or something if you need it. Pretty relaxed. One 10 pager though..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2006<br>Class Name: REL111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is wonderful! Very easy-going about deadlines. Very relaxed and understanding. Interesting subject matter. Not too terribly difficult. Perfect teacher for a level 100 religion class - not too hard, not too easy. I would definitely take another class with him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2004<br>Class Name: REL<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy absolutely horrible.  Hard grader and difficult and boring class. His class is so boring half the students get up and leave.  No class interaction, he's a nice guy, but thats it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2004<br>Class Name: REL203<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is a riot.
