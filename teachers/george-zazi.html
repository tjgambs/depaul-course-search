Show up every week, you'll excel. Take notes. The lowest homework and quiz grades dropped. He's funny. If you don't get it, the homework teaches you what you need to know.

Just the online code!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2014<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Best decision, take him. He drops the lowest quiz and re-extends homework on mymathlab before the final and midterm. Exams are multiple choice. I got a D on the midterm and a C on the final, A on every weekly quiz, I still came out with a B as a final grade. How is that even possible? He always ended night class an hour early. Don't need the book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2014<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Please disregard bad reviews of him, trust me. I'm also one of those students who are not math gifted, and Zazi made it easy to understand and even fun!  Attendance does not count for a grade but you NEED to attend since every lecture teaches you about everything you need to know for the tests, and there is always a small (easy quiz). </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2014<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Zazi is a Great teacher, He made a difficult subject more interesting and receptive. There are quizzes, don't worry if you come to class you will be fine. His accent is a little difficult to understand at times but he does a great job making sure the whole class is on the same page. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2014<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are not good at math TAKE HIM!!!

He thoroughly explained each and every problem in class which made the HW and Quizzes easy. The HW is online with mylabsplus. There is a quiz every week. Mid-term and final is multiple choice and some quizzes are too. You would have to be really lazy to not get a B n this class at the least. I would totally recommend to anyone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2013<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This prof was a pretty good. i was kind of nervous of taking math cause i've had bad luck with other teachers but he really did break it down and make it easy. there's quizes everyweek on the hw due the week before so it's convinient. not to mention you get out early :D wish i could take 136/137 too</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Zazi is the GREATEST MATH TEACHER of ALL TIME.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2013<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OMG! Prof. Zazi rocks!!! If math is not your strength you must take him! He is a first teacher who makes a difficult class easy and breezy. You must work though to achieve a grade you want, but it is an easy A if you are not afraid to spend couple of hours outside the school and practice! No surprises on midterm and final. Take him; won't regret!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/09/2013<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Coolest math teacher ever.

He's funny too! Never enjoyed math so much! Buy mymathlab. No book. Multiple choice test, so if u don't know something u can use the answers and work backwards. He's not picky either. Exapmle:I answered .014 instead of 1.4% & he gave me 1/2 credit after I spoke with him. He really wants you to pass. Just make sure u go to class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/18/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ZAZI IS THE MAN!

Hes funny, and allows people to actually interact in the class. We had legit times in math class and thats hard to say. I took him for both 135,136 and got A's.  You actually learn somtn retainable</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/03/2012<br>Class Name: MATH135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>four words "Zazi is the man"! if you value your grade take him, believe me you will understand math after taking this guy.

HW problems appear on the quiz. Both HW & quiz problems are on final and midterm. TAKE ZAZI! Just don't expect staying awake in class to get you an A, you need to DO HW AND STUDY! + he is HILARIOUS.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2012<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO your homework that he assigns, this is the BEST and only advice I can give you. Calc. is not my strong suit, so I am not going to say it was easy, but if you take the time to do your homework and actually do it you will do fine. Very similar problems from the homework are on the quizzes. Again if you want to do well in his class do YOUR HW.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2012<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher and all of his classes are very easy. I took him for MAT 135,136, and 137. He's a nice guy and is funny at times. He gives out a weekly quiz with about 5 questions and that is worth 40% of the grade. Midterm and Final are worth 30%. Concentrate on doing well on the quizzes very simple.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2012<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All I have to say is take this professor. He is by far the sweetest guy and such a great teacher. I was hesitant to post on here until I was for sure signed up in his 137 class because I wanted to make sure I got my spot! I have had him for 135, 136, and 137. He makes calc fun, class is always let out very early, JUST TAKE HIM. YOU WONT REGRET IT!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2012<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Zazi is great and funny. I took a night class w/ him & he always lets us leave an hour early which is nice. Weekly hw, only a few problems, very easy. Weekly quizzes which come directly from hw & drops the lowest grade. Midterm was easy & multiple choice. Final not cummulative since we did good on midterm.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2012<br>Class Name: MATH135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I could slap myself for not taking Zazi for 136 this quarter. He was SUCH a great teacher, his class is literally calc for dummies. Make sure you do the hw because the same problems show up on weekly quizes and exams--which are SO EASY if you do hw. He only teaches you what u need to know for tests, which i LOVED. DEF taking him for Stats SP Qr.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2012<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the BEST teacher...okay math is not simple i would know struggled with math all my life, this teacher will explain to you the basics of math and not all this theory stuff other teachers teach you...this is my seconds time retaking it, and only had to go to tutor once. and lets us leave an hour early</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2011<br>Class Name: MATH135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SO nice! he's also really funny and always willing to meet before class to go over any questions since theres a test every class, but it's literally so easy cause the quizzes are 3 questions and JUST like the homework, its a night class but were always out atleast an hour before.

He brings the difficult subject matter to students level so that its easy to understand. This was the first B I ever earned in a math class. Sometimes you have to stop him to understand whats going on, but the bottom line is he teaches..you learn end of story. WATCH for the final though, its tough!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2011<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! He is very clear and approachable. Great with answering questions. For this class, our grade was made up of only the weekly quizzes, the mid-term and final. He always lets his night classes out an hour or more early. Nice man, and he teaches at a great pace. Take notes, listen, and come to class. you should be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2011<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree with everyone else he is a nice guy, but gets down to business. Expect to spend alot of time with tutors if you do not already understand the material, as he likes to assume everyone in the class is some sort of math genius.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2011<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I spent more time with math tutors then I did in class, but even then I struggled.

As long as you put in a lot of outside class time to study, and keep up you will do just fine. You will be expected to know the material before showing up to class, which is a downside so you have to study outside of class and teach yourself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2011<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>if you see this review, keep searching.. this is not a professor u want to take.... =/</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2011<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy, but curriculum he uses is not.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2011<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>bad experience, having to retake this class again.. avoid at all costs. unless your some sort of math genius, then im sure you'll do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2011<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible.
