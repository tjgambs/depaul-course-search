He truly wants his students to succeed. I took a level 300 Finance class as a complete accident, and fell in love. His class ultimately led me to change my major to Finance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2013<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have mixed feelings about this class.  Unless you have some kind of interest in real estate, I would recommend another elective.  Class is pretty boring, book use is extremely heavy (know it frontwards and backwards for the exams which are impossible!).  He is super nice though and very knowledgeable which helps.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2007<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The midterm and final were hard to me and I read everything from the book. Make a lot of points from the paper.He's really nice and knows what he is talking about. Go to office hours for help if you need it, it helps.I was worried about my grade but it turned out great because of the paper. Do go on the quizzes!online quizes 4 book help for tests!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2007<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is alright.....What I liked was that you had to write ure I.D. number instead of your name on the quizzes, tests, and project so he can fairly grade us.  More Professor's SHOULD do this as well!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2006<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor, tests were a little hard but overall it was a great class. We went through a lot of information that some of the other professors did not cover so if you are a Real Estate Major it would be a good choice to take this guy.</div></div></div></body></html>
