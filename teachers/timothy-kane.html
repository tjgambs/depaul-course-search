His critics are really critical and the direction is not always clear.  Its like he expects us to be perfect and many of us have a fear of public speaking, like a lot of people.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2015<br>Class Name: INTC220<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are not comfortable with public speaking, I would not recommend taking him to be your mentor.  He lectures on what you are supposed to do, shows a video of the right and wrong way and provides you will feedback a week or two later.  This is not the best environment for learning or overcoming a fear of public speaking.  He is a tough grader.</div></div></div></body></html>
