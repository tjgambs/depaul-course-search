Unfortunately in her middle eastern studies class I felt very behind (like there was a pre-requisite) by the first session and it just went downhill afterward. There's a crazy amount of reading assigned to each class session, which is only doable if you have a genuine interest in the subject.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>lots of work but so worth it</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Cook is a gem. take all her courses NOW!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she was pretty tuff but brilliant. take whatever she offers!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2008<br>Class Name: ANTRO102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOME TEACHER!
