Some people find microeconomics hard but no matter what teacher you take it will be if you are one of those that struggle with new concepts. My suggestion: go to SI Sessions, it not only helped me pass, but I got an A in the class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2015<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a great teacher very helpful and cares about teaching othes; however econ is a tough subject.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2015<br>Class Name: 105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>She's seriously great.

Gives great examples and power point lectures. However, her midterms are long and more like final exams. She gives two quizzes, homework assignments every week and a midtermfinal. STUDYING is a must for this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2014<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Bucci did a great job teaching all the basic concepts of Micro.

It really made being in class as enjoyable as possible. I would recommend her to anyone, but this class isn't easy. You will have to study difficult material. She was not the best at giving homework back, but posted the answer key every time. Lectures can be all over the place. Note taking is hard</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2014<br>Class Name: ECON314<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is a very enthusiastic and nice teacher.  Her lectures are rushed and the information is galore, but she is willing to help and organizes her information well.  The only problem I had was that the homework and notes are exponentially easier than the midterm and final.  She does not prepare you well for her tests and offers no reviews.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2014<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>I liked 106 much better than 105, but Bucci was pretty good. I have a good aptitude for Econ, my only complaint is that on the quizzes, the problems were a lot more complicated than what we went over in class. She's a clear teacher in what she wants, and she knows her stuff and has been teaching for a long time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/24/2013<br>Class Name: ECO305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best Econ teachers I have ever had.

I think she taught well only thing I have issue with was the homework. Sometimes it pertained to class other times it felt like busy work. Midterm and Final are tough so be prepared. To conclude, tough tests, great teacher, not impossible to get an A but you have to work for it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2010<br>Class Name: ECC105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Proff Bucci explained everything clearly. Showed terrific examples, she took questions& allowed people to make comments during her lectures. midterm had some tricky questions but if u explained why you chose that answer to her after she gave them back you could get more points.

She is a very nice lady and encourages student participation.  On the down side, I don't think she teaches the material very well.  She goes very fast, sometimes to fast for herself, causing her to make a lot of mistakes during the lecture. Do the homework and you'll pass.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2010<br>Class Name: ECO305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Got to use a sheet of notes on midterm, no reason to not get an A. Homework isnt even that bad. She is funny and very in tune with the class, not to mention a great teacher.  Will take her again if I have the chance.

Talks a mile a minute, the information is difficult and it goes quickly. Homework is graded and dont expect to get a perfect score. She never gives that out.

Very hard grader, but she wants you to learn.  Show up to class, take excellent notes, ask questions, and review then you should get a B or C on exams.

She explains the material well in class, but her midterms do not reflect her teachings.

I learned alot in the class and knew what I was doing however she gives weekly quizzes that are weighted and bring your grade down.

Attendance is mandatory if you want to score and A.

Frankly, she is one of the best professors at DePaul. However, she does not “inflate” grades like most professors; you must earn a good grade.

Her tests are extremely hard. She doesn't curve which is crazy because her class grade averages are in the D range. She has a geek complex and resents other girls. DO NOT TAKE HER....</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2004<br>Class Name: ECO306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great professor.  Her lectures are clear.  You don't need the book, but her tests are hard so be prepared to study a lot.

She's very helpful when you ak her for it. However, her material is difficult to grasp if you're not quick on your feet.
