That being said his lectures can sometimes drag on and become boring. Each week he assigns a short worksheet for homework which can be done in groups. He posts powerpoints of notes from the textbook so do not buy the book!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2014<br>Class Name: ECO375<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Phelan is a nice guy and will help you when you need it.  Econometrics was a tough course and he tries to make it as easy as possible. However, the class seems a bit disorganized with the information from his lectures being different from the assignments.  Overall, I would recommend taking him for econometrics.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2014<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great teacher and very knowledgeable about the subject. Class consisted of midterm, final and problem sets. My only suggestion is take LOTS of notes, basically everything he says and writes on the board. Don't waste money getting the book because I never even cracked it open. I would definitely take him again and did I mention he is so hot!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2014<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome guy! He actually got to know everyone's name in a big class. It was an easy class yet I still learned a ton because he explains everything so well. 4 problem sets, a midterm and a final. He gives you a review for the final and midterm and just changes a few things for the actual tests. Definitely take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2013<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Phelan is smokin' hot. He's so kind and sweet. He really wants the students to learn and understand. He curves the midterm. He offers a lot of extra help as well. I loved him and would take him as my teacher for every class if i could.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2013<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Phelan was an excellent professor. He gives a practice midterm and final which are very helpful in preparation for exams. Very approachable professor and willing to help you understand the information. If you can take him you wont regret it. Class consists of 4 problem sets, 1 midterm,1 final and participation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2013<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! He is so nice and helpful. The material is not hard if you study or pay attention in class even the slightest bit. The tests are fair and he gives a practice test, that is exactly like the actual test, to study. He is always available to help, although, given his thorough lectures, it is doubtful the extra help is necessary.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2013<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy... He's good. There's quite a bit of material covered; however, it couldn't have been presented more clearly. The tests are difficult yet extremely fair-no curve balls. take him if you can; you won't regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2013<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you don't do well in this class, you deserved it because Professor Phelan will do whatever it takes to make sure you grasp the material and do well on the tests. He his honestly the most caring professor I've had and he truly cares about his students and what they're learning. Best Professor at Depaul period.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2013<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the my favorite professors.

He answers any questions and if you stay after class he literally will stay there as long as you need until you get it. The class consists of a midterm, final and 4 problem sets along the way. The problem sets really prepare you for the midterm and final. TAKE HIM!!</div></div></div></body></html>
