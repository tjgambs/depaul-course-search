It is a H-A-R-D class!!! WAY TOO MUCH chapters reading assigned and too much h/w from lab. DIFFICULT AS HELL for a bio requirement. Yes hes a nice man, but the course is hard, thats all there is to it. HARD HARD HARD!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2006<br>Class Name: BIO202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great teacher. No doubt. His exams are a bit difficult because theres a lot to study but he makes boring subjects interesting.

His exams are tough.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2006<br>Class Name: BIO310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Maginniss is the best teacher that I have had at this school. Not only does he go above and beyond his knowledge in the subject area, he is great in trying to hold the attention of his students.  He uses funny examples that show he is really trying. He is also just a friendly guy to talk to!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2005<br>Class Name: BIO310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is one of THE BEST professors I have ever had in my entire college career!  Take any class with him that you can- I've taken a couple of courses with him and they were both interesting and exciting.  Great person, great prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/25/2005<br>Class Name: HUMANBODYWORK<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This prof is GREAT!

You HAVE to study, attend class (every session), and take good notes. If you do all that you can do well in his class.  He is very entertaining and knowledgable. I would def take another class of his!  LOVE HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2005<br>Class Name: BIO202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent Teacher! He knows how to explain complex systems in a way that makes sense to the averge person.  His Teaching style uses handouts and the chalkboard... His lectures are supurb and he is always willing to help out if you ask.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2005<br>Class Name: BIO103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very clear! He simplifies concepts and drawing in ways that are more easy to digest and remember. He is by far one of the best lecturers for Biology at DePaul, I really enjoyed him. (You do have to put in a lot of effort though)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2005<br>Class Name: BIO103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very informative but the class covers a lot of detailed material.  There really aren’t concepts to know like BIO 102, I felt everything was memorization.  Gives outlines of notes that are very helpful come exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2005<br>Class Name: BIO202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the most helpful teachers I have ever had...as a non-bio major it really made the difference.  He makes class and lab really interesting, but you have to study for the exams.  Take him if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2004<br>Class Name: PHY<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice teacher, but his tests are very hard.

This is the only biology (bio 101-A/102-A-/103) that I got lower than an A- (i got a B+). However, it's because of lab.
