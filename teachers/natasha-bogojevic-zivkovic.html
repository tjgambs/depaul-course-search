I turned in both papers late without points off.  She accepts it by email, and doesn't always remember when you sent it so made it easy to say it was ontime. Quizzes, midterm, final-she tells you almost everything that's on there. EASY.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2004<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy class.  2 BS papers, 3 easy quizes, midterm and final.  During lectures she tells you exactly what's on the quizes, and the day before the quizes she does it again.  If you can do this, don't miss more than 5 days, then you've got at least a B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/06/2004<br>Class Name: MUSIC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor.

If the students don't get something, she makes it seem like everyone is stupid. The material is streight forward and makes getting a good grade easy, but the professor is at best mediocre.</div></div></div></body></html>
