You have to work for your grade -- assignments are non-trivial but very useful.  I was able to take architecture concepts straight from this class and apply it.  The prof also included some interactive activities which I liked even though I am an online student.  I recommend this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2014<br>Class Name: SE480<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rediculous teacher, quite possibly the worst teacher ive ever had in my life...very unclear about everything!

This class requires critical thinking instead of typical drill-like homeworks.  Lecture materials are very well prepared and she is an inspiring lecturer.

She's clearly in tune with current industry practices and pushes students to submit work at that caliber. If you want to learn about software architecture and work on fun coding assignments take this class. Tough class but well worth the work and effort.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2011<br>Class Name: SE482<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Huang is a very clear,concise and helpful professor. Very passionate about requirements engineering. Unfortunately the topic is extremely boring. If you can avoid taking this class would highly recommend it because it's super boring. Assignments are very long. Final project even longer.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2011<br>Class Name: SE480<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was a difficult class, but it was well worth the effort.

I disagree with the previous review too.  All assignments were graded against a rubric so you knew exactly why you received the grade you did.
