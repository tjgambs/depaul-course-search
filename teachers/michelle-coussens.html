Do NOT take her for the summer, she literally takes a normal depaul quarter into a summer session. She favors, and ashames her students infront of hte entire class.

Excuse me but I can stay at home and download the PowerPoints versus you reading them in class to me. DePaul really has you on staff and you are being paid to teach. Don't talk her because she can't teach, the exams are terrible. She want to control you versus teaching you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2007<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Winter Quarter '07 was her first one here at DePaul. You talk about a primadonna, she is better than you. She makes you feel like you are in grammar school. Why are you here, you have a full-time job, your own consulting business and now you teach. Don't challenge her on anything because she cannot handle it. Please leave you can't teach</div></div></div></body></html>
