Throughout the class, the only assignments are three papers of about 900 words each, so its very doable. I highly recommend him for his teaching skill, and he also can be pretty funny occasionally.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2014<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. White guides you through 3 major types of philosophy with a paper for each section. Very straightforward guidelines. Participate in class and try on papers and you should be fine!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2014<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good & competent prof. Knows his subject matter & will challenge students to think critically abt what he is teaching them. Took him yrs ago and still find myself mulling over things he taught us. Very passionate and intelligent.You have to read to pass so if you don't its your own fault. Youre in college, stop complaining about your homework.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2012<br>Class Name: PHL202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is a very easy workload-often you dont have to read readings because he explains everything in class. BUT its not an easy A by any means. class grade comes down to 3 papers. He grades too hard on papers for not giving specifics to go by. Get 1 or 2 bad paper grades & your whole grade is ruined. He wont give extra credit no matter what.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2012<br>Class Name: PHL202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dont take class unless you are a PHL major. He forgets that nonmajors are in his class too. You can get away with not reading much, but the lectures are SO BORING. He grades hard on the 3 papers-He gives you freeform paper options and tells you to be creative but then gives bad grades if its not what he wanted it to be under some unstated standards</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2012<br>Class Name: PHL202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor White keeps the class extremely interesting.

Only 3 papers, and he's not the easiest grader around.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2012<br>Class Name: PHL293<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an amazing professor, at times it seems that you are actually witnessing someone like Socrates.

He loves philosophy and he knows that not everyone else does, so he tries to make it interesting for everyone. He is great at provoking thought and challenging assumptions. I was impressed that he wrote a review of my essays, rather than just stamping a grade on them. He loves the subject and he loves to teach. Two thumbs up!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2011<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors at DePaul, a little on the harder side of grading.

Extremely knowledgeable.  8 o clock classes suck but Dr. White's was the best one i could have asked for. Easily the best class i've taken at depaul yet. because of this class i am currently debating etither a double major in philosophy and chemistry or maybe just switching to philosophy all together. He makes you think!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2011<br>Class Name: PHL325<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Animated and superbly knowledgeable, David White has been teaching philosophy for over 40 years and is still sharp as a tack. He delves pretty deep into the material, but will still have you cracking up. His crotchety brand of old man humor mixed with his comedic cynicism balances the weighty material. Extremely willing to help outside of class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2010<br>Class Name: PHIL105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>To pass this class you must be a good writer. There's only 3 papers and class participation. He's not very helpful, because when you ask for paper help he isn't going to help you. If you want an easy A don't sign up for this class. Aside from all of the cons, very thought provoking class. He's obviously an expert of what he teaches.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2010<br>Class Name: PHL202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He encouraged me to double major in Philosophy and gave me a lot of confidence in my abilities He often said I should write a book of my theological theories He gave amazing feedback, encouraged debate/criticism, detailed explanations, I loved the book. 3 written exams (for each one you answered 2 questions 500 words each) Take him if you can!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2010<br>Class Name: PHL320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best teacher at DePaul.

However, this class was extremely boring. He reads from the book and repeats everything. Class is not mandatory. You could do well on the essays by using common sense. I did not enjoy this class and his teaching style! Do not take if you do not get philosophy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2008<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. White has been my favorite professor so far.

It was obvious that most people were in the class because they were made to be, but White made it interesting and easy to understand. No need to read outside of class; he goes over everything you need to know. Attendance isn't mandatory, but if you go every week it will help A LOT when you write the 3 essays.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very clear teacher.

No need to read, he explains it during class, but it is helpful for the papers he assings. A fair grader, I got all A's on my papers, don't bother read his hand writing, you won't underst.it. Kind of creepy, but very insightful. Best prof. so far!!!! Very knowledg., does care for particip. but it's fun and helpful.

It centered around debate, so there was always a chance for individuals to voice thier thoughts on the readings, making it very interactive. Not much pressure, just a few fun papers to formulate opinions more clearly. This professor is the very fun and makes an effort to connect with his students.Highly recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2007<br>Class Name: SOPH200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>never understood how the readings were related to the objectives of the course. basically impossible to get a good grade unless he liked what you said in class. didn't seem to respect other opinions, or be open to ideas different from his own (and it's a PHILOSOPHY class). tough grader, and no explanations for grades given. only 3 grades.

He is one of my favorite professors thus far, and I am not majoring in Philosophy.  I took this class to fill a requirement, but he is so good that I actually enjoyed it and learned something!  Readings are optional because he goes over it all in class (not required, but makes material much easier!)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2007<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. White might just be the best professor at DePaul.

Im sorry but i dont see how everyone likes him.  Yes he knows alot about philosophy, but really seems like he doesnt care if anyone else learns anything.

Grading consists of 3 take home exams.  Does a great job delivering to his audience because he knows we are college students without much knowledge of PHL.  Quirky guy with loads of itelligence.
