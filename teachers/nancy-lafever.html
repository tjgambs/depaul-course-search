She goes over every assignment with you. The class is simple. You learn about 4 genres of writing and you write one paper for each genre. She is a super easy grader, It's hard not to get an A or a B. The midterm is a 3 paragraph metaphor and the final is a narrative. You only use the Nortons field guide. Take Nancy!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2015<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a really a sweet personprofessor. Her lectures do seem a bit long but it's because of the reading questions. She lets you work in groups. So if your group has boring people sorry. You do write a lot of papers but that's because of the course. She gives good feed back and cookies. The final was fun to make. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2015<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Helpful. Reasonable.

The only problem is that she may not explain assignments or directions very well. Make sure you ask for clarification. Use the writing center for help and for EC!! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>WRD103 is required and I picked her class cause it didn't conflict with anything else.  Nice teacher, easy class.  She is one of those teachers that will wait for people to talk during discussions if no one says anything, so if you talk, she'll cling to you.  Other than that, she genuinely cares about your progress and plays music before class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall, she was a good teacher for me because I excel in writing and rhetoric, but she does not teach anything new or different and if you interpret an article that doesn't agree with her view, she will flat out say you're wrong, which brings a negative attitude to the classroom.  All of her assignments, ESPECIALLY the final, are insanely vague.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BEST PROFESSOR EVER. Seriously she is so sweet and caring.  She is not a super hard grading, and the class is really not bad at all.  Even though the little reading quizzes are hard, the class overall is not.  TAKE HER CLASS!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Lafever is a very nice person. Her quizzes from readings are simple. The research paper grades are given every step of the way with a chance to correct mistakes for a higher score. I recommend her as a teacher and I enjoyed my time in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2013<br>Class Name: 104WRD<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a really simple class, but she makes it so FRUSTRATING. You don't know what she specifically wants in a paper until you get it back with an undesirable score. Oh, and if your opinion is different than hers, YOU'RE WRONG. Basically she made me hate my first year here.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed taking Mrs. LaFever's class.  She is friendly, approachable, and has clear expectations.  I believe this class prepared me for my future assignments at DePaul.  You will use your book, so it is a good idea to buy it.  You will build a e-portfollio, write four papers, and have quizzes based on the reading.   Good Luck!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's great. This class was super easy. She does make you do a lot of readings with questions (that are time consuming, but easy) and four papers. We had a lot of interesting discussions in my class and it made the class a lot more fun. She is so helpful with any questions, and is very clear about everything. Great professor overall.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice person, okay teacher. Too much busy work and she only wants her answer when it comes to the homework question. Easy blow off class, didn't learn anything different from my English teachers in high school.
