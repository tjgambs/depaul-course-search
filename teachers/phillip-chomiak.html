Great sense of humor and clear illustration of contents. I really love his lecture!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2014<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher.  He knows that the material is dry and boring at times, but tries to make it interesting the best he can.  Very personable and good sense of humor.  Mid-term and final, no other grades.  I highly recommend taking him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2013<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>In graduate school I expect my classes to be challenging and always welcome it. Chomiak made this much worse than it should have been. His Midterm/Final consist of very specific items in the book. I want to learn concepts not that I can memorize from a book. #1 complain I have is when I went to see him for extra help he did not want to help at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2013<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Solid professor with dry sense of humor.  Goes over tons of examples, so if you can follow along you should do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2013<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You will get quizzes at the beginning of each class and work through examples.  Other than that, it's on you to do most of the learning on your own - online and via the textbook.  The class is basically just two test, so make sure you spend enough time preparing for the midterm and final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2012<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.  Prof Chomiak is so old school!  Very dry/sarcastic sense of humor that helps move a boring topic forward.  He makes difficult concepts seem simple and grades fairly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2012<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors at DePaul, with a great sense of humor. He makes lectures interesting by giving a lot of relevant examples. Be prepared for many hours of studying if you want to get a good grade but you will learn a lot! It was one of my favorite classes even though I have no interest in accounting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/02/2011<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dry, witty humor, but overall he made acc555 about as fun as it can be.  If you take good notes and take time to learn the lectures, you should be able to get an A- without too much work</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2011<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher! Lectures are funny and interesting. Exams are not that difficult if you study regularly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/13/2011<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Chomiak makes this course more difficult than necessary - worse, he's not very accessible.  Getting him to return e-mails is a pain, and trying to schedule time with him outside of office hours is even more difficult.  Not the best instructor (note he's not a professor) DePaul has to offer.  For $3,400 don't waste your time with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2010<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A wonderful Accounting Professor which is a rarity. He explains things well and is very accessible to students. He wants each one to learn in a fun way. His tests are not easy but having him teach is worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/29/2010<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ACC 555 is horrible.  Chomiak makes it enertaining but in all honesty his tests are not easy and if you dont read the book you are in deep trouble.  Be ready to read alot and memorize even more--he only goes over questions he askes at the end of his exams...the other 50 multiple choices are out of the book---good luck.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2010<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Chomiak is a good professor and his classes are engaging. I agree with other comments about it is not an easy class and the workload is a little overwhelming if you attempt to utilize all &quot;resources&quot; available. He is a good professor but don't expect to breeze through this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2010<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tough class for non-accounting minds. Lots and lots of charts and numbers. Chomiak gives you way too much stuff to study for the mid-term and final, so it's very time consuming. Hes not that bad though, just be prepared to put a lot of time in.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2010<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.  Would tell anyone to take him.  As long as you go to class and listen you will do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2009<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Chomiak is a great accounting professor - one of the best I've had. He makes class fun, relevant, and easy to get through, even for the non accounting people. I learned a lot and was able to apply it right away. With a little work you'll do just fine!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2009<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor with vast knowledge. He keeps the class interesting and makes every one to participate. He grades generously, if you put little effort you can get an A grade easily.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2008<br>Class Name: ACCT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors I've ever had.  A very straight forward professor that makes class enjoyable. Highly recommended for anyone that just wants to get through ACCT 555 with as little pain as possible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2008<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Chomiak's style of teaching is top-notch.  His class is structured to be laidback.  The tests aren't bad as long as you attend class and pay attention.  Great professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2008<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall very good professor.  Enjoys what he does and it shows.  You'll have to do some work to understand the material but his test are fair and straightforward.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2008<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the best professor! Do your homework and attend the class and you'll get an A. Loved his sense of humor. He made somebody cry&#63;&#63;&#63; I don't believe it one bit! Very kind and helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2007<br>Class Name: ACCT201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take this professor. I took the first accounting with another professor and barely got a C. Professor Chomiak makes things so interesting and easy. He knows how to lecture and I enjoyed his class tremendously. I got an A!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/15/2007<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Chomiak is probably the best professor I've had so far. He is likeable, straight-forward, extremely fair and highly-accessible. His goal is to make sure you understand the material. He will even stay after class if you need extra help. The coolest thing was learning the history of a new Chicago street each week!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2007<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a great teacher. He assigns homework but you don't have to hand it in.  The midterm and final come straight from the in class quizzes and although he has expectations, they don't exceed what you should already be doing for any class.  Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2007<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I absolutely dreaded taking this course but professor Chomiak made the material interesting and easy to understand.  His lectures are clear and he wants his students to succeed.  His tests are very straightforward, if you go to class, pay attention, and read the textbook you will find this class very manageable and easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2007<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, funny sense of humor.  &quot;Oh Mr Chomiak, when you write it on the board, everything makes sense...&quot;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2007<br>Class Name: ACCT555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy Accounting Class. Professor is nice. Homework is not mandatory. But if you've been doing the homework, and understanding the material, you should do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2006<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor has understanding of material.  Not very hard class at all.  Midterm was easy, final wasn't hard.  I never opened the book and go a 95% on the midterm.  Pay attention.  He does love the sound of his own voice though...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2006<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His lectures are as clear and thorough as can be, and he can be pretty funny at times.  He doesn't try to cram too much material down your throat and genuinely wants you to understand it.  Read the chapters and follow along with the in-class problems and you'll have no problem.  I'd recommend him for any class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2006<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had a night class with him and thought it will be a pain, but it turned out to be one of my favorite classes. He's really clear on what he wants, and keeps his classes interesting. Go to class, do the exercises, and make sure you get all the hand-outs since they will be on the test!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2005<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you study and do the homework, you will get an A.  Do the homework, the tests are a toned down version of the material.  If you do a class exercise, it will be on the test, almost exactly like the one done in class (sometimes easier on the tests).  Would definitely recommend Phil.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2005<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very clear explanation of difficult and confusing material. Do the assigned homework, read the chapter BEFORE the class, look through the Study Guide and you will get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2005<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>really nice guy.  read the chapters do the homework and you won't have a problem.  granted it takes forEVER to do them all but it's really not unreasonable.  this kind of material is the stuff you HAVE to do yourself in order to get it.  reviews in class and is fair with grading.  good guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2005<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First test was very easy, second was a little harder.  Chomiak has a kind of awkward speaking style, hard to listen to for too long.  But he tends to simplify things well.</div></div></div></body></html>
