If only she taught all accounting courses life would be perfect. She speaks extremely fast (which was scary at first), but you get used to it, and because of that she goes over so many examples  its impossible to get a bad grade. She is truly an amazing teacher!! -- n I like her jokes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2014<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Phenomenal profesor. I learned so much in this class. She also gives you an idea of what you can expect to see in the CPA exam. Take advantage of her office hours because she will stop whatever she is doing to assist you and clarify anything. She is also such a sweet human being. I will definitely take another class with her in the future.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/08/2014<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far the nicest Accounting teacher I have had at DePaul. Extremelly clear on what you need to know for tests and makes one of the harder accounting classes fairly simple. Glad I didn't take McCarthy, heard he was a nightmare.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2012<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Hill is great and goes through a ton of in class examples and gives lots of hand outs. The midterm and final are pretty difficult and require a lot of studying but she gives you guides. Attendance is pretty much mandatory and there is assigned seating but she's a good professor I would take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2012<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's like a grandmother (Soothing voice). But her class is difficult since it is cost accounting and you do have to memorize the all the steps in doing cost accounting. Mideterm is slightly easier than the final. Both require you to memorize terms and concepts while being able to apply it to problems. Listen in class and study hard before exams!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2007<br>Class Name: ACC599<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Found her to be condescending towards students  Spent most class on research studies/regression analysis which did not have real world application  If you miss class for ANY reason, expect a make up project/solo presentation to class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2007<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: COSTACCOUNTING<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/22/2004<br>Class Name: ACC350<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is horrible.  There's a lot of homework and research due for each week of class and if you're a few minutes late, she deducts points from your grade.  I'm sure you'll learn, but boy, at what a cost.</div></div></div></body></html>
