He enjoys singling out students and does not let up, even if you tell him you don't have the right answer. 1st half class is reviewing the homework problems, 2nd half is new material and assignement of homework.

I thought he was an excellent professor and as long as you are willing to do the weekly homework, you will learn more than most other finance courses and also do well in the 2 exams.

If you are a finance major and you are serious about learning, take him, but expect to be challenged. He says he expects 9 hours a week, I put in maybe 2 and received an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2010<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I normally don't leave comments.

Very often you will be teaching yourself, it is true that he has the worst handwriting in the world, sit in front and pay close attention.Don?t give up, otherwise you will fail.

If you don't have a solid 310 foundation, you might find yourself confused. You have to read the assigned chapter carefully before coming to the lecture, otherwise your notes are useless.

HOWEVER, can learn same stuff with any other 311 PR and will be way EASIER. I withdrew and am taking another Pr and have learned a lot more because he takes the time to simplify the concepts.

You will work very hard in this class, but it will pay off in the long run. I learned so much that will help me eventually land a job. Houston is clear and precise with his requirements for the course and you must adhere to them.

If you take him and take him seriously, you will do well. I do feel he is a little uptight, but rather funny at times.

You can't miss one class or you will probably fail. There's alot of homework that you HAVE to do cause he calls on everyone.

I know there is a lot of mixed comments posted about Houston and I will clear them all up.  FIN 311 is a tough class... he says you need 9 hours/week, but I got by with 30-35 hours in the quarter. YOU MUST SHOW UP TO CLASS, HW IS MANDATORY.  The guy isn't a dumbass, he knows what he is talking about.

He is by no means an easy A.   In fact i barely got a B+ in his class.  But if you want an easy A don't take him.
