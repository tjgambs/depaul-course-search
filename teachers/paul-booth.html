He will make you laugh and feel incredibly comfortable. He learns everyones names immediately and tries to be really personable and friendly with everyone. Gives feedback right away, sort of a tough grader at first before you understand what he's looking for. Take him if you can!! Worth it</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/02/2014<br>Class Name: MCS353<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>It's rare that you find a genius who has the ability to make information accessible to anyone. Paul certainly has this gift. He's fun and keeps class interesting but never at the expense of covering material. I honestly got more academic value out of Paul's class about monsters than I've gotten anywhere else at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2014<br>Class Name: MCS353<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was an awesome professor who made class interesting.  Immediate feedback on papers. Influenced me to watch Dr. Who. I would take him if you are interested in material, though lot of work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2012<br>Class Name: MCS501<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Paul is an awesome professor.  He is always well prepared for classes, and makes himself available for students.  You will learn something in his class.  And you will laugh too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2012<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take Paul's discover class! I had a great time, Paul really cares about this subject matter and does a great job of exploring different aspects of Chicago media. The immersion week was fantastic. Hardly anytime spent not in the city. He is super approachable and has a pretty good sense of humor. I loved going to class, he is a great teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2012<br>Class Name: CMN396<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Paul is awesome. Hillarious. Enthusiastic and knows his stuff. Not at all stuffy - very cool. And he's super understanding when the group project goes to hell because you ended up with idiots and had to do the whole thing yourself. Sadly, everyone gets the same grade for the project.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2012<br>Class Name: MCS271<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing professor. Class was a ton of fun and while there was a lot of work it was ok. On a very serious note though... HOW DOES HE NOT HAVE A CHILI PEPPER!&#63; I went to class just to undress him with my eyes. Such a stud.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2011<br>Class Name: MCS271<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably the best college professor I've had. Paul is extremely organized (everything you need and more is on d2l), grades quickly, and always makes class interesting--I never once got bored. He's also super funny, and treats every student with complete respect and fairness. I really can't think of one area that Paul doesn't excel in. TAKE HIM!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/09/2011<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best professor I have had at DePaul! I wanted to go to class every week even though there was no mandatory attendance. Always entertaining and could really tell he had a passion for not only the topic, but for teaching as well. Treated his students like equals and was always there to help. Definitely recommend any class you can get with him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2011<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What an awesome guy! He made the lectures fun, he's very funny, and he's a sweetheart. The work is not difficult, and it flies by. The group projects are actually fairly fun, and I typically hate group projects. I would highly recommmend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2011<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's an awesome guy super funny and interested in his stuff BUT he assigns soooooo much work that is pointless and ridiculous for a 100 level class.. if group projects aren't your thing I don't recommend taking him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2011<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Paul Booth is a great professor.  He makes the material very enjoyable.  He really seems to enjoy teaching and he is good at it.  His class is not an easy A, but if you apply yourself, it is certainly possible.  He is perfectly clear what he expects of you, and if you still have questions, he is very available for help. Highly Recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2010<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a cool guy. I'd probably hang out with him outside of school. He's really friendly and passionate about his teaching. He assigned more work than I originally thought he would, but the class was still somewhat enjoyable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2010<br>Class Name: MCS352<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This prof is the best! Taken many classes with him, always a great experience. He's an expert, classes are fun, work is easy, assignments are not hard. All in all, take Booth! You won't regret it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/27/2010<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy. Assigns a lot of work, but it makes it easier to get a good grade because no assignment counts for much. Tries to make class interesting with pop culture references and uses of youtube. Goes off on tangents a little, but overall, a nice guy. If you have any brain at all an A will be no problem</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2010<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a nice professor and very knowledgeable of the material.  Far too much work is issued for an introduction 100 level course.  Requires 2 (3-4 page) papers, a lengthy midterm test (midterm review was horrible), 6 page final paper, many pop quizzes on the reading, and 1 page papers for every film watched in class.</div></div></div></body></html>
