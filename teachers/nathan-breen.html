I'm not particularly interested in Medieval lit, but I liked the class because he has a kind of goofy sense of humor and the discussions were interesting. Only problem is he will sometimes lecture almost the entire class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2010<br>Class Name: ENG211<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty good prof. I had a night class with him so it was almost a straight hour of grammar sometimes. Methodical but interesting. I'd recommend this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2009<br>Class Name: ENG401<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took his class (History of the English Language) as an elective and really enjoyed it. He's smart and affable, not at all aloof. Has no interest in lording his knowledge over you. Really tries to help everyone do well. Highly recommend taking a class with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2009<br>Class Name: ENG280<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Two Words: Barack Obama.

He's annoying, boring, and utterly useless to anyone majoring in English.  He uses class hours to retell you what you've read-- quite literally, page by page.  No attention is given to anything further than the immediate content of a text.  Take this class if you want 3 hours of weekly storytelling.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2008<br>Class Name: ENG282<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed not only what we read but how it was taught. Sure sometimes it is a little dry when we have to go through the history, but it is necessary. Plus the teacher is very helpful and is open to all ideas as long as you can support it. People who do bad on essays fail to take advantage of his revisions. Great fun loving teacher. Take the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2008<br>Class Name: ENG401<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor who makes the material engaging and fun. Also humorous, self-deprecating; helpful outside the classroom and a fair grader. Highly recommend taking a class with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2008<br>Class Name: ENG370<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have had this guy for a few classes and have had differing exerperiences.  Knowledgeable&#63; Sure, but there is much tediousness to his methods. Also he lays the whole &quot;cutesy-poo&quot; routine on pretty thick and he seems to get a bit of a charge out of slamming students on technicalities (&quot;my hands are tied, you knew the rules&quot;. Did well, learned nada.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2008<br>Class Name: ENGMID<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.  Energetic and engaging.

He talks the entire class but NOT about english and literature. Our class is way behind, we've only had one grade so far, it is a complete joke and I have learned nothing.  Avoid at ALL costs if you actually want to learn about english and literature.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2008<br>Class Name: LIT200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Breen is amazing.  Read the material and come to class and not only will you get a good grade, you'll enjoy yourself.  He makes even hard Literature very interesting.  Very Cute and Very charming. Fair grader. Definetly take!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2008<br>Class Name: AMER1214<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nate is by far one of my favorite professors ever. Besides being very cute and very well dressed, he is great at explaining boring topics and making you enthused about them. He is also very funny and makes you look forward to coming to class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2007<br>Class Name: GRAD400<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Breen is hysterical, a really funny, nice guy who wants everyone to do well. His class discussions were engaging--he knows his stuff but is more than happy to have a discussion instead of just lecture. This was jsut Lit Crit, which is not his &quot;thing&quot; (he's into Beowulf & stuff) but still engaging and knowledgeable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2007<br>Class Name: ENG319<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really cute and really nice, but his grading is a bit unfair.  He weights the midterm and exam more than the papers, so even though I got A's on the papers, I got a B+  in the class; if only the papers were weighted even slightly higher, I would have had an A-.  But still, worth taking.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2007<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hilarious and gets off topic all of the time. Remind him of what he was talking about and you'll get a lot out of the class, as well as have a great time. I recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2006<br>Class Name: ENG370<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty funny guy, doesn't take himself too seriously.

He's honest, approachable, and flexible, one of the best professors I've had at DePaul. His humor makes class interesting and is very supportive. Take a class with him, you won't regret it...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2006<br>Class Name: ENG310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i have no idea what the deal is with these negative reviews. breen keeps class interesting and grades fairly. both papers and tests are pretty easy. he's also got a total self-degradating sense of humor, which is funny. he's a nice guy and a good professor. take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2006<br>Class Name: ENG203<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>was unclear about what was needed for higher papers.  he gave me my lowest grade EVER at depaul lowering my GPA.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2005<br>Class Name: ENG<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hate him.

Papers were short but topics were confusing and he graded hard. A great guy, funny, but personally I would never take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2005<br>Class Name: ENG370<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SUCH a great teacher, so nice and understanding and EXTREMELY helpful. He understands that the material is difficult to comprehend and will do anything to help you out. Fair grader: 2 papers, midterm, final, go to class and get help and you'll get an A. The material can be dull, but he tries his hardest to lighten it up with humor. Cute too!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2005<br>Class Name: ENG<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2005<br>Class Name: ENG370<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is so great.  Funny in a corny way and very smart.  Readings aren't to overwhelming, just go to class and take notes.  Tests are pretty easy and papers are short.  Take him if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2005<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great teacher. What a cutie pie!!!! If he wasn't married, I would take him.lol But, he is very helpful and understanding.He makes the class very interesting, and as long as you do what is required for the class, you'll be str8. It is a lot of reading, but anything for him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2005<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was pretty nice but a tough grader. He is very funny but I would probably never take him again.  He doesn't curve at all even if you have a 79.94 I find that a little questionable considering a lot of it is not right or wrong. He could have given me that .06 percent if he wanted to but he didn't.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/13/2005<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He seems like he is nice but he is not at all. I did not like him what so ever.  He talks about not liking any of his high school english teachers but it seems to me he is no different. Basically if he likes you then you will get a good grade but if he doesn't good luck.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2005<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is so freakin hot and funny!  When it comes to grading however he is extremely critical just like your typical high school english teacher.  I would not recommend taking this class unless you are pretty good at writting papers and like to read 100's and 100's of pages of literature.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2005<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>if you're a straight male, the fact that he is hot won't matter. he gives way too much work and grades fairly hard. do not take him if you like a's and b's. papers, quizzes, and tons of reading, its just TOO MUCH. none of the assignments are hard, but he just gives soooooo much! i don't recommend</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2005<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want an easy English class this one is the way to go.  There is A LOT of reading, and you have to do it because he gives reading quizzes.  There are three short papers throughout the course (2-3 pages), but he grades fairly hard.  If you want a fun english class with a young teacher take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2005<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His stories made class interesting.
