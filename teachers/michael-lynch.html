However, Lynch's lectures really engage you and draw you into more than drinking. What I, unexpectedly, LEARNED from him has given me an edge when I interview and network. It really helps to appreciate wine flavors.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2014<br>Class Name: HSP333<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Great instructor!

One of the finest professors at DePaul. Teaches courses without putting unwarranted stress on students.

He has vast experience in the industry and has sweet internship hook ups.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2011<br>Class Name: HSP100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor.
