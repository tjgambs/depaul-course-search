No different from any other history course, it is based on lecturing but he keeps students involved and is always changing his voice. Very straight forward. 2 papers 2 exams. The only thing I wish is that he would post grades on D2L. No book needed. Just a couple of texts posted on D2L. I would recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2013<br>Class Name: HST121<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Never again!This teacher is beyond horrible. His lectures are all over the place. You learn so much information it gets confusing. He takes long dramatic pauses when speaking and he pronounces important names/places in a heavy accent so you dont understand him. So unapproachable and the tests are hard because he isnt clear.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2013<br>Class Name: HIS121<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Torres is a wonderful person, but is very unclear and vague when discussing what will be on the exam. There are only two tests and a paper, so alot of material is covered on each test. He is a very tough grader and it is very easy to fall asleep in class. I would not recommend this class if you only need to fulfill the requirement.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2011<br>Class Name: HIST320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An exceptional professor.

Great professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2010<br>Class Name: HST206<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HARD HARD HARD CLASS - He must have changed his teaching style. Quizzes have 5 sht essays and one long (no one finished or got a good grade) - no curve - U will read two novels in addition to the clss txt. 8pg paper, midterm and final. poor teaching style!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2009<br>Class Name: HST200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgeable professor.. a little boring...only 3 grades..midterm, paper, final... if you keep up with readings you'll do fine...Very kind person..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2009<br>Class Name: HST1800<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>his class is interesting because he is very passionate. he does not put anyone to sleep. the midterm and final are very easy because its everything that you have learned. he repeats himself a lot and makes sure everyone understands! very good professor i would definitely take him again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2008<br>Class Name: HST206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took his class during the summer and not many in the class but it was a very easy class. His lecture is somewhat boring but he speaks very slow. I recommend him if you plan on taking a History class during the summer. He let us use our books on half of the exam.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2008<br>Class Name: HIST300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Love this professor and the influence he has on students. I'm not sure if I agree with others about boring lectures since I'm more interested in information. People that use the term &quot;boring&quot; are usually boring themselves, so I'm not in agreement with this.  Again, the information he lectures on is pertinent to the material assigned. Recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2008<br>Class Name: LST200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy, boring sometimes but doesn't allow you to sleep because random words come out really loud..AZTECS and SUGAR CANE... Overall though he is a very straightforward professor and you will learn a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/23/2008<br>Class Name: HSTSECT<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting subject and lectures, but grades extremely hard. He is very passionate and knows his material like the back of his hand but again not an easy class. He will keep you in class until the second that class is over! Lectures with no interaction from students. Be ready to work. Attendance not mandatory. Midterm & Final are pretty hard</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2007<br>Class Name: HIST203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is not as easy as you think. His lectures are interesting, but he grades kind of hard. He is a really passionate teacher. I definitely recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2007<br>Class Name: HST203<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Please do not take him during the morning! He will put you to SLEEP!!!! The subject is ok, but OMG he is so boring...there is no class interaction all he does is talk and talk with the same tone, his take home exams are not exams, rather they are research papers, and he is over all very boring</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2006<br>Class Name: LATIN110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He knows what he is talking about, very easy going and helpful.

He answered all of my questions in great detail. His style is designed for students who enjoy the subject--not 4 those who prioritize chatting and slacking during lecture.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2006<br>Class Name: HST200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't like this professor, he is boring.

Knows what he is talking about.  He knows his stuff.  It was a very informative class.  Not very hard at all but you do need to read the assigned readings and write a one or two essays not a big deal.  He is good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2005<br>Class Name: HST206<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a nice teacher but the entire class is lecture.    He grades pretty good, but you need to pay attention to his lecture because what he says is on the exams.  Does not take attendance and does not require class participation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2005<br>Class Name: HST205<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Most boring class ever...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/24/2005<br>Class Name: HST205<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring, boring, boring.

Absolutely hated his lectures, which seemed to last an eternity.  He rambled in lectures and hesitated every 5 seconds to say &quot;UHHHHHHH,&quot; which was very distracting. Ordered the wrong book for the class and assigned ridiculous readings to be done in very short periods of time. Keep your sanity- never take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2005<br>Class Name: HST200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very good professor.

He speaks loud and slow enough to catch everything he says.  If for some reason you missed what he said, he'll repeat it somewhere in the lecture.  2Exams and a paper; they are based on his lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2005<br>Class Name: HST205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I like his teaching style as well.

Well-organized, a good mix of theory and example. He interrogated Latin American history using the concept of &quot;frontier&quot; and &quot;border.&quot; It might sound dry, but it wasn't.
