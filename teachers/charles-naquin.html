Class consists of doing quick cases in groups and then analyzing the results and learning some terminology. 2 quizzes and a final paper done within a group. Not a hard class as long as you study before the quizzes. If you can take management 300 with Naquin - do it!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/01/2014<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Naquin is very knowledgeable in the subject matter and has a lot of relevant experience. Easy class with case studies during class and no book to buy. Readings are assigned each week and are somewhat interesting. I really enjoyed the case studies which help to explain the topics.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2013<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgeable teacher with tons of relevant work experience.  He isn't the most organized person (missing handouts etc).  Tests are very specific to class discussion however are pretty easy if you take the time to study.  Mostly case discussions in class and very little homework.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2013<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the top class at DePaul. You will learn the secret behind a successful negotiation in the work place and what drives them to be successful. The assessments were really fun and it will help you build concepts . Overall take his class with him you will not be sorry.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2013<br>Class Name: MGMT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hands out one of my favorite grad school course at DePaul, what teacher would alter the syllabus to spend a class period taking about job negotiations? Naquin does! I learned so much from this class. It's very easy to do well, show up, participate, and take notes on the powerpoint and do well on the test.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2012<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was intro grad level and he didn't always seem to be the most interested in teaching it.  As a result, the class was fairly easy (assuming good attendance).  However, he is a very sharp prof with great knowledge in the subject. He is personable and easy to get along with.  I look forward to having him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2012<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing professor. The class is interesting, every time we did a case study and that helped learn. The exam was easy and very curved. Final exam was a take home group thing. My group was lame and took a long time to do it, but I think if you get cool ppl in ur group it would be a blast. I would deff take one of his classes again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2012<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor knew material, very knowledgeable. Poor admin skills, tests graded inconsistently with many student with errors (mis-adding points). Tests from PowerPoint slides and movie, all essay. Would recommend, but review all graded material for accuracy and ask questions!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2011<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class requiring minimal work outside of the classroom.  Classes entail case discussions and short power point presentations.  Grade is made up of an online leadership survey, mid-term exam, and a short group paper.  No final exam.  Take this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2011<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You must take MGT 500 with Naquin. He is awesome! Makes the subject very interesting.  I actually looked forward to the readings and class exercises.He made class fun and I feel like I learned something. I talked to students who had other profs for MGT500 and they didn't enjoy the class. Take Naquin and you won't be disappointed!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2011<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! Didn't think the lectures would be very interesting but they we're cool and the class went fast. Not to mention he always lets you out early from night class. Study for midterm and final and you'll do good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2010<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Care your mid-term!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2010<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Highly recommend! Great lectures, and Prof. Naquin is really passionate about the topic. Grade is based on a midterm (study, it determines if your grade is an A or B), short paper and group paper.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2010<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would highly recommend taking Professor Naquin for MGT 500. Interesting lectures and readings. As someone mentioned before, your grade is mostly based on the midterm exam which you definitely need to study the class notes for.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2010<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Naquin is a great professor who makes going to class fun. He gives everyone in the class an A or a B - its basically based on the grade you get on the midterm (which you should definitely study for). Just do the readings and assingments and you'll do fine. Great professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2010<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this guy really is amazing, he makes what should be a boring class for non-majors, a ton of fun. Not a lot of work but you learn a lot. 2 easy quizes and a final case study that you can finish during class. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2010<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Naquin is one of the best management professors at DePaul...take him if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2010<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of real world examples through discussion and case studies.  Lots of reading was assigned,  but it wasn't necessary to read everything.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2009<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof is very nice and takes the time to answer your questions.  Don't bother buying the book.  You'll get an 'A' or 'B' depending on how everyone else in the class does.  Exams are based on class lectures and some assigned reading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2009<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Naquin has a grading scale of basicly A or B and your letter grade is pretty much solely on showing up to class and whatever you get on the midterm.  I did not met one person who got a different grade then their midterm grade. Naquin keeps class intresting but his grading is completely subjective to his opinion.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/15/2009<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Group case study almost every class.  Reading - mostly articles.  Organized & enthusiastic teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2009<br>Class Name: MGT563<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Everyone is focusing on grades and if that's the case sure he is easy, but in general his class was spent more doing nothing and talking to classmates then anything productive, gave to much time to do EVERYTHING, would have rather had a shorter class and manage class time more effectively. In my opinion this class could have been taught in about 8h</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2009<br>Class Name: MGT563<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor who is very concerned with helping his students learn.  Professor Naquin was thrown in at the last minute and he performed admirably.  My only complaint is that his teaching style best fits a 10-week course, but as he found out he was teaching this course weeks into the term he had no choice. I would very much recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2009<br>Class Name: MGT563<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor.  Interesting lecturer.  Lots of negotiations cases.  1 quiz, 1 group paper.  Class required group negotiation with 3 negotiation sessions.  Filled in for another professor at the last minute and did a good job of it.  Focused on high level strategies and didn't get caught up in minutiae.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2009<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Charles is the best. He makes you very interested in the case studies and keeps lectures entertaining.  I would highly recommend taking MGT 500 from him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2009<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, really enthusiastic about the topic! Group work during every class keeps things interesting, little work outside of class. Easy A or B if you put forth some sort of effort.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher ever!!!!  He is the nicest guy and loves his job.  If you go to class and pay attention, which isn't hard because he is awesome, you'll for sure get an A.  Group case work every week which made class go by quickly.  No final, just a group paper.  He made the class fun and interesting.  I absolutely loved him!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Naquin is awesome! class attendance is mandatory. mostly case studies for first half, then lecture second half. Easy midterm (just study his slides) and the final is a group case (also not bad).  He makes the class fun and its not boring.  I would take him again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2008<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good professor. Class is pretty easy, and you are basically assured a B if you come to class and prepare yourself.  I learned a lot from his lectures and course design.  I would highly recommended taking him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2008<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy A, if you get a grade higher then the mean you get an A, if lower you get a B.

Very clear on his expectations, always available to help you if you need something, and his teaching technique just helps to sink everything in. I saved all of his powerpoint handouts, as they help you get through the exams, as well as applying to real life. I would love to take him again in the future!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2008<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was expecting a usless presentations class and thought he was a little fruity after the first class, but by the third class I thought he was good and by the end I realized he was great.  I learned a lot and had fun.  Take him for any class he teaches.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2008<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is awesome.

He's a bit of a name dropper, but his teaching style more than makes up for it. He makes the material relevant and explains concepts and theories well.
