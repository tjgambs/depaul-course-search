Vety neat and organized, writes everything on the board so you dont have to rush to take notes. will answer all questions if you have any. weekly quizes make you practice and are not too hard. HW is optional, I personally didn't open the book even once. Take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2008<br>Class Name: MAT448<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teaches straight from the textbook (i.e. examples and all). His humor was subtle and light. Should lose the glasses and try the &quot;beauty and the geek&quot; reality show. Geeky hot and althought lanky, the shirts fit him well (me like...).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2008<br>Class Name: MAT526<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's clear that he is ridiculously smart, which makes him kind of' hot. Unfortunately, he tends to overestimate his students' IQs, and few of us have the heart to burst his bubble when he says 'seem all right&#63;'...which is often. (Sure, McMurry...the proof seems, um, fine.) Grades are fair.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2008<br>Class Name: MATH448<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class consisted of 1 hour a week on statistical methods, 1 hour on programming examples, & 1 hour in the lab.  The professor was interesting when talking about the methods, but not as good when talking about the programming.  The lab time was a waste.  A large paper and presentation was required.  Tough questions, but easy grader.  Sarcastic.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2007<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was not too bad for a math class, and he explained the material well most of the time. Homework is not handed in or checked but the weekly quizzes are taken from it, so it helps to do them. Final not bad as long as you study your quizzes, as again questions are taken directly from them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2007<br>Class Name: MAT348<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good prof. standard math class, not too exciting. HW was a drag. mt was easy, final was challenging as the class gets harder after mt.  keep up with class & you will do fine. he is always helping students outside of class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2007<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bad teacher!  It takes him so long because he writes everything on the bored.  He doesn't use blackboard or let you know what you got on the final.  It was such a long, boring class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2006<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>&quot;well.. umm. so .. what time is is&#63;&#63; How are we doing on time&#63;&#63;&quot;  What more can be said&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2006<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very mellow guy, and awkwardly funny, he writes everything he says outloud on the board, and loves the world's greatest calculator, EXCEL. I suck at math, and it was actually enjoyable. Go to class even though, he doesn't take attendance, do the activities, and usually one hw once a week. He's very relatable, almost like he's your friend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2006<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>timmy is a questionable guy, he is a cutie. but he pretty much cannot teach math for his life, we gave him credit because it's evident he's intensely amazing at math. he's at his worst in class when he writes every word he says on the board thats 5 ft long to begin with. nothing we did in class was relevant to the assignments. his laugh is great!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2006<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HARD !

HIS EXAMS ARE DIFFICULT, QUIZZES O.K. He's a decent looking guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2005<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a very nice guy, but terrible at explaining math. He doesn't take attendance, but I don't understand how you would know the stuff without being there. Ended up with a B-....final pretty difficult...quizzes each week</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's akwardly funny. He is clear, tries to help, and explains thing well. The homework and assignments are reasonable and help you understand the material. He is an easy grader. He is young and very down to earth. I think he is dorky cute :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>gets a bit carried away putting every word he says on the board but he really does his best to help people understand the subject matter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He seems very awkward.  You can tell he tries really hard to get his point across but he just can't seem to explain concepts well.  You're better off figuring out how to do problems on your own.  He's very nice however and does his best to entertain.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2005<br>Class Name: MATH<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2005<br>Class Name: MATH448<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
