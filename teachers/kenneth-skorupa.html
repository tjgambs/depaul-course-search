Grades for work done are very subjective and work is abundant and very personal in nature.  The class is very touchy, feelly, if you do not like to talk about yourself you will have difficulty with the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2004<br>Class Name: LL102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ken was a great first instructor for students in the SNL program at DePaul.
