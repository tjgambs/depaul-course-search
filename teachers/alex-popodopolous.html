Finally, a course and a prof. that makes you think critically.

He will also be among the best you've taken and actually liked. It's without a doubt hard, but it's truly rewarding. If you want a REAL class, take his.

His lectures are very slow paced, which make me want to fall asleep. I suggest not taking the explore class, unless you enjoy reading and history. Note: He is a nice guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2003<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2003<br>Class Name: EXPLORE<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very smart, but soo boring!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2003<br>Class Name: HON204<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He turned an Urban Experience class into futuristic economics.
