If you're used getting an A for the bare minimum, you'll hate this class, but if you work for it, you'll stand out.  TIPS: - Don't just read; STUDY the book before the quizzes. - Read the rubrics and writing prompts.  Everything you need to do is very clear. - Use the comments to improve.  He gives good feedback.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2014<br>Class Name: RELC329<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>STRICT GRADER!  He's a word counter extremist, and will deduct major points for being a single word over any limit he sets.  Picky and not very accommodating.  Online quizzes were hard (you get 3 tries) but lots of material to cover, and his video lectures seem to go out of their way to not be useful on the quizzes.  Avoid if possible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2014<br>Class Name: RELC329<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I wouldn't recommend him. There are better and  more captivating professors you can take online classes with in the comm. school. He was critical of work to the point where it felt like he was just enjoying taking off points... he made tons of spelling errors in the online quizzes and things yet WILL BE SURE to mark you down for simple mistakes!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2014<br>Class Name: RELC329<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>READ THE DIRECTIONS! Everything he wants is spelled out for you somewhere. He's tough if you don't know the readings, but if you do what he asks, you'll be fine. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2013<br>Class Name: RELC329<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was awesome my live class with him, one of my favorites.  Not bad online, but it's not as much fun.  Easy to get good grades if you follow directions he gives you.  Proofread your posts, I lost points a lot for run on sentences.  Gives a lot of feedback.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/09/2013<br>Class Name: RELC329<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard to please. Unfair grading. Unreasonable when it comes to special circumstances.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2013<br>Class Name: RELC329<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very specific in what he wants and he tells you exactly what you need to do.  You have to read in order to do well on the weekly discussions and the three projects throughout the quarter. There are weekly quizzes but you have three tries to do well so as long as you read and participate in the weekly discussions you will do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/17/2013<br>Class Name: RELC329<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He spells out exactly what to do for each assignment and is very clear about what he's looking for. Tests are very fair and cover all the material discussed in class. I found them pretty easy, actually. Do the work, and you'll learn a lot! I'd definitely take another class if he's teaching it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2012<br>Class Name: RELC329<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took this course as an online class. It's mostly discussion boards and online quizzes (that you can take three times) so it's pretty easy but he is incredibly nit picky which can be irritating.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2012<br>Class Name: RELC329<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good experience overall, though he can be a little nit-picky. The workload was fine, but make sure you proofread everything! (Hint: use MS Word to type out discussions before pasting them to D2L. Worked for me!) He's clear about what he wants and will help you get things right if you're struggling. He's strict, but also very kind and supportive.</div></div></div></body></html>
