One of my favorites here at DePaul.  Her classes are very challenging, but also eye opening.  Readings are heavy, but you will learn a lot! I highly recommend this teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2014<br>Class Name: INT203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's absolutely brilliant. Fair, engaging, funny, interesting, everything you want in a professor. She'll make you want to read just so you can participate, and you'll leave class having gained something new and important every time. A must-have in the INT department 100%</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2014<br>Class Name: INT203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVED Professor Malik! She's brilliant, interesting, and just overall a blast to learn from. I thoroughly enjoyed going to class, did even feel like skipping. She uses the books a lot, and I really appreciated that she tried to keep the book cost low. Overall, great prof. Knew I was new to the school, introduced me to students. Loved her class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2014<br>Class Name: INT202AND203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hands down the best professor I've ever had. She is brilliant, funny, and engaging. Before her, I almost dropped the major. She pushes people hard and expects a lot, but is constantly supportive and encouraging. I look forward to every class. Take her if you can. But be prepared to work hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2014<br>Class Name: INT202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a wonderful professor with very clear guidelines on what she expects for assignments. Changing what she wants for a veery easy assignment 2 days before its due is not a cause for concern, especially when that assignment should take you 30 mins max. and when its based off of readings you shouldnt have done till 2 days before. Relax people.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2014<br>Class Name: INT202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's the kind of professor who put an assignment in the syllabus from day one of the quarter and then change what she wants you to write about two days before the paper is due. I hope I never have to take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2014<br>Class Name: INT202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She doesn't teach anything. She expects you to ready 100 pages in between classes and then leads a less than stimulating discussion. I would not recommend taking her if you actually want to learn anything about the class. Thus far she has been less than helpful in response to emails. She changes her office hours and then not even be there at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/03/2012<br>Class Name: INT202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Love her!!  Not only is she gorgeous and brilliant and super hilarious, but she makes difficult material easy to understand.  I can't wait to take another class with her.  Definitely of the best professors I've had at Depaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2012<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing! She is one of the best professors I've had so far. She's a genius and is funny and always willing to work with the students. She knows a ton of great information and is open to all ideology, but pushes students to look at the world in a way that promotes radical or far left ideals.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/26/2011<br>Class Name: INT202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Malik is perhaps one of the best teachers I've had at DePaul.  If you're willing to work for your grade you will do well.  She's very understanding and always available when you need help.  Go in with an open mind and an eager desire to learn something and you will do well!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2010<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was pretty good looking and on top of that she was a very nice person. VERY HELPFUL when writing your final paper! I loved her, she was my favorite professor that quarter. Class was pretty easy, a couple papers and a few homeworks... nothing too bad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2010<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a good teacher, and won't hurt your eyes either ;)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2010<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's young and won't hurt your eyes. Good teacher too, attempts to make class fun and sometime succeeds.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2009<br>Class Name: INT201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>INT 201, what a mean joke. Expect to print out 40-150 pgs/wk & subscribe to the Financial Times. 201 is hard to keep up with if you can't pick apart a reading from early on. Malik was ok. Her teaching method is dry. She won't hesitate to pop out a quiz if the class doesn't read or participate. A lot of unnecessary work and no payoff in the end.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2009<br>Class Name: INT201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's awesome. You won't get away with slacking or bullcrap but that's INT. She makes you pick apart complex ideas and never hand-feeds answers, so basically she does what the best professors do. She treats students like adults which is refreshing, and is tough but still approachable. Definitely recommend her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2009<br>Class Name: INT203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shiera Malik is hands down the best professor that I have had in my 3 years at DePaul. She is not easy, but she will take your learning and critical thinking abilities to the next level. If you want an easy blow-off class, don't take her. If you want an incredible learning experience, DO! Her passion and enthusiasm for the material are contagious.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2009<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hot and sharp !!!!!!!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2008<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Even though I did really well in her class, I did not like it. She made no sense in her teaching. She did not clearly state what she is looking for. Extremely sarcastic and always arguing with you. She is not helpful. If you ask a question, she asks you more questions back. Terrible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Malik uses lots and lots of big words. I tried extremely hard in the class and would go to her office for help with all my papers and still received a B. Malik uses VERY BIG words that no one understands!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>a lot of reading and essay writing but it was interesting .shes smart, intelligent and shes cute.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2008<br>Class Name: PSC233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Malik is a great professor! She is absolutely brilliant, to the point where she sometimes confuses the students, but she works hard at making sure we understand the material. The class is definitely not an easy one; reading and writing is major, but it's worth it in the end. She's really pretty too!  :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/26/2007<br>Class Name: PSC233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fantastic professor, fascinating and thought-provoking, one of the best I've had at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2007<br>Class Name: PSC254<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great lecturer.

She's very engaging and intuitive.  She has a wide range of knowledge on several topics.  She's also very helpful... You can get easy pts by participating and attending certain lectures and what not outside of class.  Available during office hours.  You HAVE to read for her class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BEST TEACHER EVER! Material sucks and I didn't know what the hell was going on but she is the easiest grader and gives you points for bs. I didn't want to take this class but Imso glad I did..she's got a great personality and class flies by!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2006<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fun class. Lots of discussion. It was a survey course so most of the information was overview and broad ideas.  The prof is really concerned with a students ability to express themselves politcally and spends time developing argument skills.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shiera is a wonderful prof.  She explains the material clearly and reduces it to the main points.  She does this after the students have had the opportunity to really grapple with the text so everyone can really grasp the essence of the readings.  She is also willing to discuss ideas outside of class and clarify concepts.  One classy lady! ;)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2006<br>Class Name: PSC252<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She should not have been assigned to teach about Latin American politics. She is better suited for general or intro psc classes. When asked questions about politics in specific L.A. countries she would answer that she did not know. She knows as much about that area of the world as any psc major.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2006<br>Class Name: POLISCI<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her grasp on a range of issues is excellent and she is able to articulate theoretical issues in a straightforward way. Her teaching style is integrative, and engages the student like few of the other professors I've had. I was pleasantly surprised to find an instructor of such quality at my &quot;non-ivy&quot; university.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2006<br>Class Name: POLISCI<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/06/2006<br>Class Name: PSC252<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is insecure and acts like she has something to prove. Very hard grader and completely full of herself. She could barely teach the class without having the other students help her. As a political science major, do not waste your time with her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2006<br>Class Name: PSC252<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really enjoyed her class, she challenges you to deeply analize the material covered in class and to make a good arguement in your writing. She's young and extremely intelligent. She's also very helpful. This class requires you to work hard. I highly recommend taking her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2006<br>Class Name: PSC252<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>More concerned with you becoming a better writer than politically enlightened. Did not like at ALL for the first few weeks. Started warming up after a little while. Like the other person stated, she's a bit full of herself.. She's more intelligent than she seems, but has problems getting her ideas out in class. OK if PSC major, if not PSC dont take</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2006<br>Class Name: LATINPOLITICS<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>teacher is hard, assigns average amount of reading, however covers massive amounts in class which is hard to comprehend within one day.
