I don't know if I would take him for a more serious class, but Discover Chicago was amazing. He took us around to really cool parts of the city and even got us food a few times. The only major assignment in this class is a BIG paper on a nobel laureate of your choosing. If you are taking Honors Discover Chicago, take Adam!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2014<br>Class Name: HON207<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take. Does not talk about the topics that were supposed to be covered in the course description. Does not know how to explain the class to students with little to know background in the class. Get a good grade and skip this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/05/2012<br>Class Name: DISCOVER<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Highly recommend his discover class. Really only one paper that you have to write about any Nobel Laureate.  He is a very entertaining and enjoyable person to be around going around Chicago</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2008<br>Class Name: CSC255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very British.  Definitely the most british person at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2008<br>Class Name: HCI440<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fair and fun.  Tests (mid term and final) are w/ cheat-sheet; however, there are some obscured questions.  Test is based on his ppts.   To say Adam is unorganized is putting it mildly but the class is fun.  By the time you are done w/ the class you have an initial HCI portfolio.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2006<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>discovering the chi. with adam was a blast..he has alot of interesting stuff to say and is pretty funny.  he's got a good heart and is excited to interact with his students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2006<br>Class Name: HON111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fun teacher and very fun class. if you are worried about discover Chicago, don't be.  You don't learn much in class, but Adam makes it fun and you really get to know your classmates.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2005<br>Class Name: SENIORCAPSTONE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Steele is awesome.  I used him as a reference for job interviews after I graduated.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2005<br>Class Name: CSCFINALPROJ<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him about two years ago. During the first class, he explained what we needed to deliver for the last class. That was it. Purely fourm learning. My six person group dropped down to two by the third week, but we rocked it anyways. Then he wrote me a recommendation letter that got me into the real world.  FYI read his personal studies and research.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2005<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He has a rather annoying studder that tended to distract me alot. The class was ok, and he explained things fairly well. However, if I had to take the class again I would choose someone else.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2005<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lecture notes are EASIER to understand than the book. Assignments relate to real world problems. I would recommend buying a graphing caculator TI-89 Titanium.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2004<br>Class Name: HCI511<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Never a dull moment in Adam's class!  He knows the class material, and is very easy-going in teaching style.  Most times the class was a discussion forum for the topic -- great way to structure a class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2004<br>Class Name: CSCFINPROJ<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Steele has a vast practical knowledge. He makes you do a lot of work but it's very useful. He is quite an entertaining character too!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2004<br>Class Name: CSC394<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Talks a lot and usually about nothing related to class, can be funny at times</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2004<br>Class Name: HCI594<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Having a class with him is quite an experience!
