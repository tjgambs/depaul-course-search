I have had some bad professors in my day, but this guy takes the cake.  He thinks he's god's gift to humanity even though he knowns things that don't matter whatsoever.  If he spent as much time be a d*ck on something important the world might work better.  He sucks!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2010<br>Class Name: HON207<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Rotenberg is a genius! He really encourages students to participate in class and is very accessible outside of class.  He challenges students, but in a really good way.  There is a big project, but he gives you all the information you need to get an A. I definitely recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2010<br>Class Name: ANT204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BEST PROFESSOR AND GUY EVER! He is so funny and is so incredibly smart. He challenges you to be a better person and gives amazing academic and career advice. And he was a student of ERIC WOLF - amazing! The class is reading heavy, but if you do them the reward is mind-blowing! best class and professor period.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2009<br>Class Name: ANT204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know anyone who doesn't like this guy.  When he talks you feel like you understand the world better. He's got a brain the size of a planet.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2009<br>Class Name: ANT240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Rotenberg has been one of my best professors at DePaul.  He really helps everyone get interested and makes sure we are all clear on what we are reading.  He has helped me get a better understand of anthropology on the theorist side of things.  I would totally recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2008<br>Class Name: INT201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I learned more in his class than any other class I've taken at DePaul. Do it, take him. He opens your mind up and gets you interested in international matters. Loved how we didn't have a textbook but read selections he made from the internet.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2007<br>Class Name: INT201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best. Need to go to class, a lot of reading and writing, a lot of WORK (mostly outside of class), but makes himself available.If you need help, you'll get it. Intimidating at first, but is very understand (yet demanding). Only take his class if you want to work hard and learn a lot. Give yourself easy classes the quarter you take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2006<br>Class Name: INT201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's really wants you to figure things out on your own! he is very understanding when it comes to turning things in late as long as you have a legitimate excuse! he's also really helpful! REALLY HELPFUL!!! you gotta learn to read between the lines with him which was kind of hard for me but you get used to it after awhile!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2006<br>Class Name: ANT204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Requires all of your attention, MUST READ, MUST COME TO CLASS. Demanding class, BUT you will learn insane amounts. Rotenberg is an AWESOME prof, teaches extremely well. CARES about each individual student. Extremely helpful outside of class. You can rewrite all your papers. He is hard but completely worth it, esp. if an anthro major.Dont be afraid!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: HONDISCOVER<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really respectable. I can see how some people thought he was arrogant but I liked it. Very very interesting, passionate. Did yoga with us, took us to his house and cooked us vegetables. Great prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2005<br>Class Name: ANT<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting class, but he's not the best prof.  Arrogant and cocky.  He wasn't a pleasure to sit through.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2005<br>Class Name: HON111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's a really interesting guy.  He knows a lot and will shed light on just about any subject there is.  i found him to be mildly enertaining and very helpful.  he really makes you think.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2005<br>Class Name: INT201204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome. just dont take Int or Ant if your a slacker. listen to his abstract lectures closely, you wont pick up everything he tries to lay out but its good stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2005<br>Class Name: ANT204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teachers/mentors I've experienced at DePaul and anywhere else for that matter.  If you are an anthro major, you will come out of this class changed, and a much better theorist.  He makes you produce works that you are proud of, and he enjoys giving helpful advice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2005<br>Class Name: LANGPOWER<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>okay, so he is pompus, when you become the dean of anthropology we'll see how you act. otherwise, if you step up it is very rewarding, if you want to sulk and complain and wuss out it is a bust.  I highly recommend him for people who are not squeamish.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2004<br>Class Name: INT<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you have **** you'll get more out of him than by decoding his senslessness.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2004<br>Class Name: ANT109<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is full of hot air. He is very pompess and likes to show it. His grading is very unclear and unfair. Class was a complete waste of time. Makes you do time consuming vocabulary lists like you were in grade shcool. Avoid taking him if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2004<br>Class Name: INT204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Outstanding professor.  The weak and defensive won't survive.  You'll do great if you listen and do the work properly.  Lazy people with bad attitudes won't do well and won't like him. He has a lot to offer. He's really nice and helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2004<br>Class Name: INT201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hardest class I ever took and the worst teacher by far.
