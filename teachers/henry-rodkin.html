However, the simulation provides another chance to prove your ability. I think we did not use the textbook frequently. Mid term is 25 multiple questions.

He is thorough, no BS and really knows the stuff. I would take a professor with Life experience over a PhD any day of the week, and Prof's like Rodkin drive the reasoning behind that point home.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/12/2010<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class and professor made me want to pick up Marketing as a focus for my MBA.

You will get out early every night, which is awesome.  Lectures are a little old and could use some new examples.  Has a tendency to ask questions then interrupt students to give his view.  Overall a decent class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2010<br>Class Name: MKT555A<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Marketing 555 is a fairly easy class within the MBA program ... it is not a quant class. You must have intelligence since you attend DePaul KGSB ... each one of us should earn an &quot;A&quot; no matter who teaches MKTG 555.  Rodkin brings relevant marketing stories, case studies to the lectures.  Sense of humor is ...dry, quick witted. I left with knowledge</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2009<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All around good guy. Loves marketing and his students, always willing to help. Sad to know he is retiring soon. He was one of my favorite professors at Depaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2009<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors at DePaul. Class is interesting/informative. He does not stress you out at all. Class consisted of a simple assignment, midterm, Tribute project (not very hard), and a &quot;stress-free&quot; final that you dont even have to study for. Aside from being a good teacher, Prof. Rodkin is quite the funny guy. Best choice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2009<br>Class Name: IB550<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Rodkin is passionate about the subject, engaged the students and treated everyone with respect. However, he was also pretty laid back; therefore, the class was not very challenging. Should be an easy A. I very much enjoyed the Country Manager simulation and got most of what I learned from the class from it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2009<br>Class Name: MKT576<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The presenters that Professor Rodkin brings in are outstanding.  The case studies are also very interesting as they show how to apply the concepts that you learn in class in a real business setting.  Very knowledgeable man with an impressive career path.  His class would improve if he relied less on powerpoint in order to engage the group.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2009<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rodkin is a very nice guy who will help students with anything. He goes through 180 slides in 2 hours. Almost always got out early (it was summer session though).  His midterm was fair and his final was &quot;Who Wants To Be A Millionaire&quot; game.  B/C it was summer, we had to write a short papers each week. I enjoyed going to class and him as a teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2009<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Rodkin really wants his students to succeed. He is willing to help with anything, especially resumes. His powerpoints were long, but he made them interesting and used real life examples. Take him if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2009<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy class, he's very seasoned in the subject, and he's very willing to assist students succeed. All that said, I can't recommend this class. He runs through 100+ PowerPoint slides a class and reads every word on them. There's a useless simulation exercise with little direction.  In the end, I didn't really take anything away from this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2009<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You can't go wrong with taking Rodkin, awesome, helpful, and really fun class.  i never in my whole career at Depaul for undergrad and grad went to a class for all ten weeks, i always manage to miss one.  His class was one I looked forward to going and have attended all of them.  He gives a lot of information on companies and their MKT strategy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2008<br>Class Name: MKT541<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely a world-class course with guest speakers virtually every other week, a challenging brand management simulation, and a broad spectrum of ways to manage brand with success!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2008<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rodkin makes it seem so easy you hardly realize you are learning until the class is over and you see its applications in business!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/06/2008<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was a required course, but Rodkin made it so interesting and comprehensive I loved it!

Open book mid-term. Group activities are easy and fun. Attend class and participate and that is basically what you get graded on. The greates professor at DePaul for sure!!!!! Highly suggest to take him!!! He's awesome. And you really do NOT need to buy the textbook, just print the outlines from blackboard</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2008<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's not easy anymore. He's cool but he got in trouble with the Dean for giving a all of his students A's. Now he has a strict scale and makes his students purchase a $60 worthless computer simulation as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2008<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rodkin is a great professor.  The grading in the class is very subjective but in the student's favor.  There is a take-home midterm, StratSim online marketing game, and the final.  You have a week to complete the midterm.  Take it seriously.  Make sure your team is paying attention to your StratSim performance.  Get to know Rodkin. He's good stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2008<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you like his entertaining style, you will miss it once the class is over. The simulation is a lot of fun and you will learn the effectiveness of marketing tools. If you utilize the tools and know a little about FIN you can rock the simulation. Hank should grade harder for people which don't do well on the sim or don't bring in European candies;)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2008<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rodkin is a good professor.

He has soo much real world experience in the field. That said, this class is sort of a joke. All powerpoint based but his stories can be interesting.

We had an open book mid-term, which was massively curved.  We played a group game that took ten seconds to finish.  We took a one question final that everyone got an A+ on as long as you spoke english.  Somehow, I attended every class and got an A-.  I think it was because he would be fired if everyone got an A+</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2008<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is tells alot of stories that relate to certain marketing tactics.

YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT! SO EASY ITS LITERALLY A JOKE!

Marketshare is easy and getting an A is easy as well.  The midterm was open book and the final is going to be a Jeopary game.  he said he forgets who answers the questions right anyways so everyone gets A's.

If you take a night class, you are out by 7:30. Only two assignments the first 2-3 weeks of class, after that no HW. Mid-term was a take home and Final was easy (if you studied.)

You write 3 papers, each 1page long,& they are really easy. Ex: explain what SWOT is. ALSO- class never got out past 8pm, usually we were out by 7:30pm. so really you only go for an 1 1/2 which is great! AND midterm take home, and final was easy-he tells u the questions and essays that will be on it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2006<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was an extremely easy course - more of a dissertation of one man's applicable experiences in marketing rather than real theory. At the grad level, I would have been disappointed in the content if I felt the class should have been value added. Rodkin makes the material entertaining my making it relevant.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/29/2006<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful and his experiences were applicable to class.

However, the class was nothing more than an easy grade. I didn't walk away knowing more. If effort was put into it, you would learn, however your learning wasn't enforced with work. Marketing to Hank is common sense, not cumbersome words that try to make more of the easy subject. Class as a whole was a breeze.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2006<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a nice guy and his class is easy, but I too feel that I should be getting more for my buck. 2 papers at the beginning, a midterm, and a final (which is basically one big joke- you get one powerpoint question).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2006<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy A.  He has a lot of experience in the field and a lot of good stories, but I sometimes felt that I should be getting more out of a grad. level class, esp. since I'm paying for it myself.  The longest class was 2 out of 3 hours.  Grade based on mid-term, computer simulation game, and showing up for the final.  Very little reading, no homework.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2006<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teachers at Depaul.

I think he sucks as a professor. I tried really hard to like him. Just reads the slides realy fast.
