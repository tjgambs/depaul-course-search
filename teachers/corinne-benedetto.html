She is probably one of the smartest persons I have ever met.  She is very knowledgeable in so many different areas.  Her field is sociology, but she is very smart in all areas.  I have taken three classes with her and each time I am blown away at her intelligence and ability to inspire me to know more!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2006<br>Class Name: DECODHUMBEHAV<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A rare find! Articulate, Brilliant, Caring AND Likable. Fun too! You will work very hard but not feel overwhelmed because of the way the class is organized.
