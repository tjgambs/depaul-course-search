James's feedback on papers&the fact that he allows you to revise them really helped my grade. He really cares about students understanding the discussion&gets that they want a good grade, so he'll work with you to achieve that. He goes off on tangents in his lectures sometimes, but at least he's passionate!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely likes to push his students but thrives on feedback. Can get caught up in lecturing but is always passionate about the material. Always do the readings and speak up in class and there's no way to get lower than a B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2013<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>To start off, the professor has a very subjective grading scheme; however I do understand why. He gears his grading policy towards making you incessantly, and arduously working your ass off. I don't think I have worked harder for a class in my life (I got an A); however, I do realize philosophy is a weak point. Very nice professor, and very helpful</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2013<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably one of the best professors I've ever had. He's a great guy and is very compatible. He also gives very clear and concise lectures. As long as you pay attention you'll get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2012<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>James is awesome! He is extremely interested in his students success and as long as you put in an effort you will be fine. Philosophy was not my thing, but James made it really interesting! Take his class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2012<br>Class Name: PLH248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Quality prof on so many levels. Great speaker, very moving lectures that make you think. He's totally chill and open to his students feedback. Cute too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2012<br>Class Name: PHI100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great teacher. He's real with his students and doesnt pretend to be the "perfect teacher." Hes fair and often forgiving for late papers. Hes a new teacher but he is VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE on his subject. The material is hard to understand but he is helpful and gives good grades on the 3 papers if you try to understand at least.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2011<br>Class Name: PHL106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>James is new to the teaching scene but is very knowledgeable on what he teaches. He's cool, calm, and relaxed. His class isn't difficult and the work load isn't bad. Highly recommended to all students.</div></div></div></body></html>
