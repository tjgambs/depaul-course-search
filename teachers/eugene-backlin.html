He adds his own stories to the class. I can read the slides myself and I don't care about his stories. The course is not helpful at all. Homework are not made based on the material covered in class but a copy from Princeton. Only good thing  is you can easily get an A from him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2014<br>Class Name: CSC403<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Backlin is the kind of teacher that wonders what all the fuss is about programming being difficult. I believe that it comes so naturally to him, that the confidence he exudes inspires you to his same level of comfort. While his lectures are not sensationally on par with, say, a speech from a politician, his style allows you to learn easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2011<br>Class Name: CSC373<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For a grad preq, this was a fun class. Good guy. Very helpful. Intersperses stories of real-life experience into his lectures. I felt bad that the guy didn't have a &quot;hotness&quot; rating, though, so I figured what the hey, he's a good instructor, definitely deserves a bit more kudos.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/21/2010<br>Class Name: CSC383<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He grades failrly but almost always EXTREMELY late</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2010<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took this class online. Got a B- in CSC 211 and a A- in this class. I didn't watch the lectures, just went thru the PP slides and went through the book. This class isn't easy, but it's not extremely hard. If you can learn on your own thru the book, take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2010<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is just average..well experienced, but difficulty in lecturing clearly - I think he speaks faster than his mind is going. The homework is a little too easy, but do extra exercises from the book to practice and he will help you through rough spots.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2010<br>Class Name: CS224<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's almost painfully understanding and helpful.

He is a very fair grader.  Just make sure to turn in assignments on time and check your projects before uploading them into colweb. If you do the work, (which there's not a lot of) you'll get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2009<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful and responded back to email quickly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2009<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The guy is awesome, he lets you go about writing the code the way you want to.
