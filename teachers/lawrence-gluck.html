He has no lesson plan ever, he just walks in the room and starts writing on the board, and he takes 15 minutes to do a problem that should have taken 2. He relies a lot on My Math Lab, and you will basically teach yourself using that. No one should EVER take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2010<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Please listen to me if you have the option do not take this class with Professor Gluck unless you are experienced with Calculus. Nothing against him as a person but he is the worst teacher I have ever had in my life.

Unfortunately, his style of teaching is horrific.  I never took a Math class where getting the right answer while using the correct methods was wrong.  You must also use his methods, which are long, tedious, and outdated.  He does not like to be asked questions. I recommend you look elsewhere.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2010<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok so basically this teacher is useless and I dont understand why he is still teaching at DePaul after having so many complaints on him!Basically the ONLY way you can or should take this class is if you havea good understanding of math and are good at it! Otherwise good luck on passing. Dr. Gluck is an intelligent person but CANT teach anyone!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2010<br>Class Name: BMS136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Gluck is a brilliant man that really knows his stuff. Having said that, he has no talent for teaching and uses his knowledge of math to belittle his students. Rude, incomprehensible, and illegitimatley hard; professor gluck needs to retire before he is retired. DO NOT take his class unless you really have to atone for something horrible!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2010<br>Class Name: BMS136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>each lecture for the most part consisted of going over one single problem from the homework for the first hour. with the remaining 30 minutes he would attempt to teach us the new material. his notes are scribbled all over the board, almost illegible to read or follow. office hours provided little to no help but showed that i was trying. get a tutor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2009<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher!  Gluck knows his stuff and will always explain everything very clearly.  All these negative comments are heated by these students' ignorance to math, as well as their need for an exciting class in order to learn.  You might not find Gluck the most interesting teacher, but he's definitely one of the smartest people i've ever met.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2009<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm a math geek, and even I hated his class!

I did not learn a single thing in his class and every time I left I felt dumber. He likes to go on tangents about nothing and thinks it's funny.

Half the time no one showed up or left before halfway into the class. we never did anything related to the book and more than half the class dropped after the first class. If you want to have fun in a class and not learn anything this is your place.

He is extremely confusing in class and is not helpful at all.  The majority of the class time was an arguement and he is not an eas grader. A tutor is recomended if you end up stuck in class.

Didn't really learn anything even though I did all of the hw and tried my best to pay attention during lectures. His lectures are 90% unrelated to the topic at hand. He discusses mayan temples, horse saddles, and other random interests instead of calculus Easy to get a B due to huge curve, but getting an A is hard w/o tutor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2009<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Words can't even describe...

If you can't find another Professor, take the class next semester. Class is based on 50% midterm 50% final. Homework and attendance means nothing. Exams are curved like 3 pts. I ended up with a C by me teaching myself and when I toke BMS 126, I didn't know anything!!! AVOID AT ALL COST!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2007<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All of these reviews are absolutely true.

I suggest that you ignore his lectures and teach yourself. If you can't (or don't want to) do it and have no clue about the calculus then you will surely fail. His 'explanations' only make sense to him and he makes even the easiest problem seem like rocket science. Forget about the calculator-you're not allowed to use it on his impossible tests. He takes attendence. Bottom line: if you can, take someone else!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2006<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take this professor! Avoid at all costs. The class is based on a 50/50 scale, 50% midterm, 50% exam. I attended every class and worked my ass off teaching myself all this stuff, and still only got a C-.

Unless you are a math genius and want to  dedicate 20 hours per week at learning this stuff yourself , you will fail. Guy makes no sense in his lectures.
