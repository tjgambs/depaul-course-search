Easily 100-250 pages of reading for each class. Unclear grading criteria. Very egotistical of his 9+ books. Discussion in class is torture. Very subjective overall.

Just spend a couple hours each week reading the chapters and watch the online lectures to complete an easy weekly quiz. Some assignments can get stacked up around the same time as other classes but that is to be expected in college.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/03/2014<br>Class Name: HST111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class consisted of 15 multiple choice quizzes, 5 graded discussions, 2 exam assignments each with 5 essay questions that have to be minimum two pages (exactly 20 pages of work) Then a four page cumulative take home final.

Expect to write several long papers. Has a high writing standard but offers help and actually doesn't grade too hard. If you are diligent and participate in class you'll be fine.

Prof. Mockaitis is a smart dude. He literally knows everything. He's able to combine numerous disciplines in the field of history, thus, making a very compelling and interesting class.

Discussion style class focused on Nazi Germany.  He almost always kept class interesting. The papers weren't too hard and the reading wasn't too dense. Highly recommend this class.

He thinks he's brilliant and loves the way he writes, so he docks points if he doesn't like your writing style. He really knows his subject, though, and the workload isn't terrible if you keep up with it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2009<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Thinks his class is the only one you are taking. He gives you only two days to read literally hundreds of pages. He expects you to read several novels during the course and write long papers on them. The workload is huge! Yes, you do learn a lot about Nazi German, but at a great cost to your free time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2008<br>Class Name: HST330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor.  Very articulate, and if there is a final he will give you the exact copy on the first day of class.  No surprises.  Take him, you'll learn something.  Only issue with him is that he hates laptops in the classroom.  Oh well</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/06/2008<br>Class Name: HST217<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>After reading some other comments, I would like to say the following. He is challenging because this is college. Wake up people someone is paying 8 grand every ten weeks for your bum to be at DePaul. He is a great professor and I feel I got educational bang for my buck. If the prospect of reading scares you...you shouln't be in college!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2008<br>Class Name: HST217<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Some colleges require laptops in class.  This old man bans them from his room.  I guess as a history teacher he is stuck in the 17th century.  Lectures in the most boring tone.  Requires 2 written pages per week plus a four page paper which requires you to reach a 300+ page book. He is cocky, rude, and arrogant towards students.  He should be fired</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2008<br>Class Name: HIST292<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor so far. Very nice about snow storms and being sick, is funny in a highly intelligent way. Not just lecture actually involves students in discussions. take him if you get the chance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2008<br>Class Name: HISTORY<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a smart guy, but has a huge ego. Overheard in the post office: &quot;I have a Ph.D. and yet I cant open a mail box&quot;... insisted that we call him &quot;Dr.&quot; sure it's respectful but he lectured us on how he deserved to be called Dr... as a future medical school student I thought it was a bit funny. Still, smart guy. Take him or leave him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2007<br>Class Name: HST277<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was looking foreward to his class on war & peace but its obvious he has favorites and likes to hear his own voice talk.

The class was very low pressure while keeping the pressure on the papers which he offers more help than other professors on anything you need help on. Although he is kinda tough, you will learn a lot but only if you put forth the work. Take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2007<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is one of the harder honors classes, and he is one of the harder honors profs.

It was very informative and Mr. Mockaitis was very funny in a strange cynical way.  He had a lot of nice anicdotes to tell and always prepared the lectures in an organized, comprehensible manner.
