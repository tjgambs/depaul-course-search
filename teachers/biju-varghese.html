She genuinely wants everyone to ace her class and takes time to help everyone get there. She will require effort from you but that is necessary if you wish to learn math. I strongly suggest her over another math teacher, she is also grades based on participation</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2014<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Varghese was honestly the greatest math teacher ever! Although her accent can be hard to understand she does her best and you get used to it. She is extremely helpful, tests are straight forward, and she gives you reviews before every test. Going from a poor MAT 135 teacher to her was amazing! I wish she tought 137!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2014<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Varghese is an AMAZING math teacher! She explains everything very clearly and is very friendly! The tests are exactly the material that she covers in class! No surprises! She sometimes also gives some extra credit problems at the end of the tests. Overall, I HIGHLY recommend her! Hands down the best Math Professor at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2014<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would recommend her to anyone. She went over the material slowly so it was easy to keep up. Her midterm and final are exactly like the review packets she posts, so if you look over them enough you're guaranteed an A. She always gives a couple extra credit  questions on tests.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2014<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredibly strict and don't expect to get out of class the slightest bit early or on time for that matter. She uses every minute and her accent is pretty hard to understand. For tests she doesn't give a review packet she just works out the homework, stay away if you prefer test/exam review sheets. Overall I would stay away from her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2014<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor.

However you must attend class and especially DO THE HOMEWORK if you want to succeed in this class. She can be a bit slow and tedious at times, but she's a great teacher for it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is willing to help you because she really does want to make sure that alll of her students learn the material, but she also likes to have 15 minute long speeches about not interrupting her class. If you know nothing about calc, take her class because you will for sure learn, but if you like math, you might get bored.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an AMAZING teacher. I failed this class twice before taking it with her and I have never more clearly understood Calculus II.. Her tests are just like the homework. And the homework is mandatory. So, do the homework and review it before the quizzes. No surprises on the midterm or final. She's strict, but she is awesome! Highly recommend!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2013<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>you cant get better than her. If you are looking for a calc 1 or calc 2 teacher, take her! Super nice, super easy. It is math so you are going to need to do work but i cant see how you'll find a better calc professor than her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2013<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It is math so one has to work hard and do the work assigned. But  ever did she assign overwhelming amounts. She is great and caring for every student. You put in the work and it will pay off. She is the best math professor I have ever had. She is the best and a must take!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had a pretty bad teacher for 135 and was worried I wouldn't be prepared for 136 and I was wrong! Varghese is a wonderful teacher who honestly wants you to succeed. Ask her questions if you're confused, she wants to help! Even though it's an 8:30am class, it's worth it. Just don't talk during her lecture, she takes that very seriously.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Varghese was a good teacher. She answered all the questions and really cared. No surprises on the tests, it was all covered in class. If you paid attention in class and did your homework you barely need to study because youll get at least a B.

Her grade scale works in your favor, ex: and 60 percent is a c-.  If you dont pass the class you kinda deserve not to.  She is strict and will call you out if your acting a little rude.  Calc isnt easy but she makes it easier.  The class is 2 tests (40%), hw plus attendence(20%) final plus mid term (40%).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2012<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I struggle with math, a lot. Professor Varghese is a wonderful teacher. Her tests are not meant to trick her students. If you do the homework, the tests are based right from it. She stresses a lot about doing the hw as a test, and if you do study that way, you definitely will pass! I'm taking Varghese for 136 and I'm not nervous whatsoever.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2012<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best math teacher I have ever had, ever.

Very helpful, and she genuinely cares about students receiving good grades. She has an accent, but it's not unbearable. There are many other math professors at DePaul with worse accents and she is much better than most. Don't slack off, pay attention, ask for help if need be, and you will do great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2011<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best math teacher I have ever had!

She knows what she's talking about and can also teach it. If you're taking this class with a friend, don't. She is very strict about talking. Attendance and homework are mandatory.

She goes through problems repetitively which sounds bad, but it helps so much, and it also helps that her quizzes and tests are nearly the same as the problems she does in class, step-by-step.

Although her accent is a little hard to understand once in a while, she knows how to teach. She does example after example (which can sometimes be tedious), but it's very helpful for students who struggled in the class. Her tests are also based on her study guides, which are based on the homework. I recommend this professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Birju is by far the best Math Prof. at DePaul. It's not that she cares what people think of her its just that she shows that she genuinely cares. She says that if you try your best and work hard she will go out of her way to help you succeed. Do take her and you'll be glad that you did. She gives you all the tools you need to get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2007<br>Class Name: BMS156<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Varghese did a great job in teaching 4 chapters of material in only 10 weeks.

She did everything in her power to make it easy for us. I have no idea how there were individuals who were still failing her class.
