No alignment between assignments. Unrealistic and out of touch expectations - completely confusing curriculum in the class and across the program. Get prepared for some awkward moments in class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2014<br>Class Name: SEC321<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unfortuntely, he's unavoidable for Secondary Ed majors, but this is the worst professor I have ever had. He gives no clarification, guidance, or guidelines under the guise of "allowing student creativity," when in reality he just doesn't know what he's talking about. The class was easy, but I learned absolutely nothing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2013<br>Class Name: TCH4XX<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yes, Prof. Worthman is quiet, monotone, and maintains a very steady temperament. His classroom activities are not exciting or the material. He can def. be more assertive. However, he is extremely pleasant, sympathetic, and full of insight. He is more of a friend than a professor, which I value a bit more as an education student.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2008<br>Class Name: TL525<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have no idea who actually posted that this teacher is worth having.  You and this professor are the reason we have bad teachers here in Chicago.  I am not a student who is &quot;mad&quot; at this teacher, I received an A in his class.  His class is lecture mixed with some small group interactions.  His expectations are unrealistic, boring, TERRIBLE.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2008<br>Class Name: BIL420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2008<br>Class Name: TL429<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't listen to anything the people below me have said.  I was terrified to take his class because of the bad ratings here and found him to be the exact opposite of everything below. Dr.Worthman is an amazing professor and I think everyone should take his class.  People usually fill out these forms because they are mad.  Take it from me: he rocks.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/19/2008<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Said he hadn't taught the class in a while and that he didn't really like teaching this particular class.  While he allows you state your opinion he relishes the opportunity to tear it apart. God awful class that I was happy for it to be over. TAKE THE OTHER REVIEWS TO HEART, WE AREN'T MAKING THIS STUFF UP FOR FUN.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2007<br>Class Name: TL525<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would recommend (if possible) that you do not take this course with this professor.  He is very boring, no enthusiasm.  He does not incorporate what he preaches into his own practical work.  The assignments are fair, but most are completely pointless, that will not help you in the education field, rather only help you in his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2007<br>Class Name: TL429<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst prof.I've ever had. You have to walk on eggshells for fear that he will hurt your grade.The amount of work he requires is insane.His grading system is super skewed.I wish you all luck - there's no way around this guy, he's required.Note that I received an A- in his class too, so I'm not bitter about a poor grade. Crap of the purest form.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2007<br>Class Name: TL525<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very boring.  Words cannot sum up just how awful this class and this teacher was.  Same topic discussed to death, boring projects, too many papers, thinks too highly of himself.  Always be aware of teachers who hand you reading material that they themselves authored.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2007<br>Class Name: EDU525<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher ever.  Makes every class a discussion on the same thing every week.  Super boring, harsh grader, too much work!  OH, and don't miss a class, he doesn't take any excuses and lowers your grade no matter what!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/16/2006<br>Class Name: TL426<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class as part of my program. The guy is nice, but the class was just not good. His teaching leaves a lot to be desired, and his expectations are highly unrealistic. I was actually quite interested in this course until I took it. The workload was excessive.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/29/2006<br>Class Name: SEC325<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/24/2006<br>Class Name: LITERACY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2006<br>Class Name: EDUCATION<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He taught nothing real, tangible.  I currently teach and I learned NOTHING from this guy that helped me when I entered the classroom.  But then again, at least five years ago, nearly none of the DePaul education professors were worth a dime--for my money I got the chance to BS and theorize--but was taught nothing practical, useable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2005<br>Class Name: TL426<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is awful. Do not take this guy. I think a corpse could teach a better class.</div></div></div></body></html>
