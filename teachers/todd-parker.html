He'd sooner chew off his own arm than admit he's wrong or incorrect. If he doesn't know something, he will feign that it is beneath him to even answer, and that it's your job to find these things out on your own.

Thoroughly enjoyed his classes and his sarcastic sense of humor.  I disagree that he is misogynistic.  He went out of his way to include readings by Restoration/18th Century female authors.  I recommend his Bible & Horror Lit classes!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/11/2005<br>Class Name: RESTORATIONLIT<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2005<br>Class Name: ENG<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i hate him and you will too</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2005<br>Class Name: ENG204<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: ENG280AND284<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Parker is great.
