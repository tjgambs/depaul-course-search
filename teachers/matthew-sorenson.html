SOME students express having a hard time following himhis scattered slides. but thats because they want the information in an easy way. I learned by sorting through the material so it made sense to me, because we ACTUALLY HAVE TO KNOW it to be a nurse. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2013<br>Class Name: NSG322<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Use the book and the study guide work book to study for his exams. He uses the questions in the work book for the test and quizzes. He's a goofy guy and knows his meds. Memorizing all those drugs is hard so STUDY!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/16/2013<br>Class Name: NSG322<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Needs to make himself more transparent and trustworthy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2012<br>Class Name: NUR322<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2012<br>Class Name: NUR322<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Sorenson is truly one of the best professors in Depaul. He wants every students to pass and do well in his class. He is not the type that tends make things difficult for the students. Because of his teaching style, my interest in  Pharmacology is at it highest level. I ended his class with an A. Great job Dr. Sorenson!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2010<br>Class Name: NSG303<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful, test questions are not as difficult as previous posts.
