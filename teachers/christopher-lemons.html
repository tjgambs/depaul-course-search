Integrated into rock music, I think Chris did a fantastic job with the class. He is extremely disorganized, and I had no idea what my grade in the class was at all times, but the class was easy and an interesting way to fulfill art and lit credit. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2014<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cool guy. Quite funny and a fairly easy class if you study.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2014<br>Class Name: SOC281<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>History of rock music was an awesome class. Lemons knew everything about everything, and he helped you understand as well. You have to go to the class and take notes, and you'll pass. The listening lists are important as well. He has a weird, yet awesome, sense of humor. "Let's get back in out Doctor Who phone booth's..." take this class if you can</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2013<br>Class Name: MUS108<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Odd sense of humor. Subject matter is very interesting, just take notes and listen and you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/23/2012<br>Class Name: MUS108<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely easy professor if you attend lectures, but be sure to take notes. Not a whole lot of textbook usage. When life gives you Lemons, take that class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/23/2012<br>Class Name: MUS108<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, easy class. Not a whole lot of textbook usage, and he kept it interesting</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2011<br>Class Name: MUS108<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was very knowledgable with the material. Go to class and take notes and you'll get an A!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2009<br>Class Name: MUS108<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not as bad as everyone says, but it pays to have a bit of background in music if you're going to take this class, as he delves into a lot of topics that are probably way too hard for non-musicians. Also, be prepared for some pretty crazy quirks, including his extremely verbose way of speaking. Not great, but not terrible</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2009<br>Class Name: MUS108<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is strange/goofy but has a very unique sense of humor and knows an insane amount about all music. If you take notes and listen you'll ace the midterm, the rest of the work is easy and the textbook is not a necessity.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2009<br>Class Name: MUS220<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take his theory class unless it's something you're really interested in. He introduces difficult material and expects you to catch on fast. He's a little pompous and has a really dry sense of humor, but if you can handle it, his course will really give you a challenge.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2008<br>Class Name: MUS108<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>REALLY DRY.  Very boring.  Can be really condescending towards students.  I did not like his opinion of what good examples of rock bands were.  Came off as really elitist.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2008<br>Class Name: MUS104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst musicianship professor I have ever had. My class got stuck with him after the administration decided to make some changes, and it was a bad idea. The music and theory of the class is incomprehensible in the midst of all of his weird comments, like &quot;tweet tweet tweet&quot;. Worst professor ever, don't take him if you can avoid him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2007<br>Class Name: MUS109<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is really passionate about his subject, which you think would be great. but he gets upset when you dont know what he is talking about, which will be more then half the time. Dont miss class or else you'll really feel behind + he makes no effort to help anyone. dont take this class unless youre really really into opera!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2007<br>Class Name: MUS109<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is so unclear about everything, the description of the class sounds great, but the class itself has nothing to do with it. You spend most of your time on opera, so if you like sitting for an hour and half being confused and bored, this is the class for you. And he is VERY strange!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2007<br>Class Name: MUS109<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the most unclear professor i have ever had. He assumes you know what he is talking about even though this class is for non music majors. He has no text book so he basically writes four words on the board and talks about them.The midterm is hard even though he gives you exactly what to study.He is crazy and theworst professor ever!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2006<br>Class Name: MUS108<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst class ever.. sooooo boring... covered the british invasion without ever mentioning Clapton&#63;  Don't even know how that's possible but whatever.. Professor is ate up bad too so it's just annoying to listen to him talk..  Doesn't know how to make eye contact with a class.. talks to the back wall instead.. Just weird</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2006<br>Class Name: MUS109<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I tried to meet him outside of class. He refused to meet me, said he would e-mail me. Never did. Never was clear on homework. Class was for non-music majors and my roommates who played instruments for years still had trouble when I asked them for help. Didn't go over any of the homework or the mid-term. Not organized. One of the worst teachers</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2006<br>Class Name: MUSICIANSHIP<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lemons is probably from another planet, according to him &quot;Zork&quot;. But if you want to laugh your as off all day long because of the weird**** he says (which is extremely entertaining) I sugggest you take him. I had an awesome time, if you work u'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2005<br>Class Name: MUS108<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a cool class.  I learned a whole lot about the acutal music itself, i know take a different approach when hearing music, its cool.

The class is easy, but make sure you go over the songs list for the midterm and the final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2004<br>Class Name: ROCKMUSIC108<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is cool...the class is really easy and he is not bad...the only thing is he tends to call on without you raising your..he kinda expects you to know somuch because it comes so easy to him...i got a B in the class but thats only because i didnt study for the midterm which brought my grade dow</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2004<br>Class Name: ROCKANDROLL<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awsome dude.

Knows EVERYTHING about what he's talking about and the class itself isn't all that hard (some busy work, but nothing extreme).  He is a very strange guy, though.  Lots of weird little quirks about him that can get annoying really fast</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2004<br>Class Name: MUS109<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very confusing but very easy.  Gives a lot of tedious homework, but very easy.  You turn in everything at the end of the quarter.  He jumps around on the subject matter though, which totally confused me. I ended up with an A though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2004<br>Class Name: MUSIC108<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rock music class is not bad.  really interesting...the midterm is about 15 questions and u have to identify about 10 classic rock songs...VERY EASY.  also u have to do two 3 page papers, and do rwo worksheets for homework every week.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2004<br>Class Name: MUSIVVI<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>not the best teacher, lacks in theory. but new class for him, so adjusting&#63; he avoids questions much of the time. has entertaining/annoying habits, such as &quot;ch ch ch ch ch&quot; when he thinks, and wants you to teach yourself doing what he calls</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2004<br>Class Name: MUS46<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a good teacher at all. Very confusing on what the subject matter is that he is talking about and tends to stray. Esp bad at theory. Only get through Brahms when others have made it all the way to Debussey.
