Your finance career at DePaul is going to get real hard real fast. I couldnt imagine this lady teaching home economics high school class. I took her for financial statments and just assigned cases the whole time. Could not even explain them to me. Totally lost!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2005<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2005<br>Class Name: FINANCIALSTMT<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2005<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The cases would be helpful if they were explained. Does not motivate students. Not a good teaching style, you will have to learn by yourself if you want to get anything out of the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2004<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not get me started on this one.  Probably the worst teacher(does not deserve that title) that has ever walked the halls of any college.  Did not teach us anything.  Disgrace to DePaul University and the finance program.  Enjoy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2004<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You will learn nothing from her! Pregnant, sits and lectures, does not comprehend material herself. Probably the dumbest teacher out there.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2004<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Did not learn much from this class because of the horrible teaching style. Does not lecture and lets class out very early all the time. Not prepared to discuss cases in class, but has the solutions manual handy! Please do not take her if you are serious about your finance background</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2004<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An absolute disaster. This was a graduate-level class; half of the students in the class will probably end up doing that stuff professionally. But how&#63; She didn't teach us A THING!!! &quot;Go home, read the book, do the case, go home. Material is super-hard, teaching was extra-soft. Avoid her if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2004<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst professor I have ever had.  No dedication. Sorta turned us loose to jsut learn cases ourselves.  I was expecting to be challenged, instead I was just insulted, heh and all you people who took 310 with her, well you dont know****, ill have respect for you when you survive John Houstons 311</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2004<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This lady is a peach of a professor! Not a lot of homework, weekly quizzes are curved, test is very fair. She does a lot of skimming probably b/c she goes through a LOT of material</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2004<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice teacher but was a pushover, we decided when we wanted to have the final. She did a good job explaining things when we had questions.</div></div></div></body></html>
