Nice guy too</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2005<br>Class Name: PSC150<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Dufour is a very passionate, interesting professor. He ties the material we study to a lot of what's happening currently around the world. I'd really recommend him. Also, while he does let his more liberal (social democrat) bias be known, he is objective and willing to listen to other opinions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2005<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you're interested in the subject, you will LOVE the class.

He was a nice guy but didn't allow for class discussion and student participation, which was a big portion of our grade. I learned a lot from his class, but I will never take him as a teacher again (if I can help it).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2003<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Is a little difficult grading presentations.
