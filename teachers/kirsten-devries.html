Weekly quiz that she pretty much gave the answers to the week prior; paper assignment rather unclear, but I went to her during office hours and she was very willing to help.  Long lectures, but very informative (they definitely demonstrate her intelligence). Really cool person, I bet she's fun at a bar!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2005<br>Class Name: HIS210<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>VERY BORING!!....Its extremely hard for me to go to this class. You take at least five pages of notes in each class, all from powerpoint.  She is very unclear about topics..The work load is a lot, more than any other 200 level course I've had..STAY AWAY</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2005<br>Class Name: HST210<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far the WORST professor i've had at depaul. Her lectures are always based off powerpoint, she doesn't explain much of anything, and she grades her tests based on how she likes your style of writing. Class is extremely boring and the workload is ridiculous for a 200 level course.</div></div></div></body></html>
