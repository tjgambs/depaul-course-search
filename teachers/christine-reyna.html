Not a psych major, but still managed to get a B+ on my first psych course (a 300 level!), so not hard. Just do the work and listen to lectures--test q's will seem easy.

You have to go to class, bc her online quizzes are mostly from lectures, and she will also throw in questions in the exams that she went over in class.
