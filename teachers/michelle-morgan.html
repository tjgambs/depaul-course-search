I can't begin to explain how unorganized she was. She could talk about one thing and then 20 minutes later tell us that wasnt what she wanted to talk about. She never answered emails. It was a waste of my money to take this class. HORRIBLE professor that thinks she knows EVERYTHING and will tell you off if you disagree</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2015<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unless you live for abnormal psychology, don't do it. Midterm consisted of a bunch of stuff that was not in the book or discussed in class. Extremely hard class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2015<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Went to every class, read all the chapters, took notes for both and still struggled so much. She wasn't helpful either, tried reaching out and she told me to look at webMD... Regardless of the class, I recommend choosing a different professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2015<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B-</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teaching style. Hardest class I have ever taken and I have a 3.9. Disorganized, barely checked email, tangential, not helpful, claimed she was discussion based yet she lectured the entire period etc.. Didn't get any grades back until week 5 (midterms).. I could go on for days! Do not make the same mistake I did, avoid at ALL costs!! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2015<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice lady, but one of the worst teachers I've ever experienced. 2nd time I've taken her, no better than the first. Unclear, disorganized, confusing, learned nothing. She's a total moron, often goes off on tangents. Your only hope of learning anything is by just reading the book. I can't even express how much I hate being in her class. DO NOT TAKE. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2015<br>Class Name: 366<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Morgan is, simply put, amazing. I have taken her for three classes, and I can assure you that she is incredibly intelligent, compassionate, and thoughtful. Her classes have given me endless knowledge but have also driven me to think more deeply and view the world through a different, more empathetic lens. TAKE HER! You won't be sorry.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2014<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Morgan's research methods class 2 was awful. She kept switching around due dates, and was completely unorganized. She didn't seem like she knew the material very well, and graded the online quizzes VERY harshly! The group projects were a hassle. Avoid the headache and DO NOT take her for PSY 242!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2014<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst class I have ever taken at DePaul! She is extremely unclear in her directions! It is non stop Lab reports and tests! It was the most difficult class I have taken at DePaul due to the lack of detail and explanation needed to get an understanding of what is expected from you. STAY AWAY!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2014<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I have to say that Research Methods with her was one of the worst classes I've taken at DePaul. She was extremely unclear and unorganized. It mostly consisted of her throwing vague statistics at you with no interpretation and having you write lab reports based on our class "experiments." She was unresponsive and unhelpful I learned nothing. Avoid.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2011<br>Class Name: PSYCH353<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I LOVE HER!

She has so much experience as a working psychologist and she does not hesitate to share those experiences with her students. Take her if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2010<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved her class and have not seen another teacher so passionate about her subject. She made you excited to learn and changed my perspective on mental illness. She makes a lot of interesting movie references and case studies during class. Wealth of knowledge here and all her assignments are easy. Pay attention in class and the exams are an easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2010<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring classes, but an easy grader.

Offers a lot of extra credit.  She really cares about her students and likes to make sure you really understand the material.  I would definitely reccommend her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2010<br>Class Name: PSYCHPSYC<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Currently sitting in class, I can tell you that this is one of the most boring classes I've taken. No, it's not because of the material, which I find very interesting.. but this teacher gabs on and on thinking that specific case stories are helpful. In reality, she repeats cases and I am asleep. She also has a sweating problem.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2010<br>Class Name: PSYCH353<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was the best professor I had at DePaul! She is so funny,has alot of discussion and she is extremely helpful. If you don't understand something she will explain it until you do. She has an extreme passion for teaching and you can tell. I would highly recommended taking her class! I loved her!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2009<br>Class Name: PSY306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher I've ever had!
