He's so chill, you learn a lot, and grading is easy. He passes his passion of philosophy on to all students - even skeptics, and he's funny. As long as you have some common sense, his class is not difficult at all. Definitely take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2010<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Tapia is great! He's really nice and funny. Class is super easy if you just go. Read a little bit and you can get by. Participate in the discussions and he'll love you! I would recomend this class for an easy A domain requirement. PS he doesnt even have a thick accent some people are just ignorant.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2009<br>Class Name: MGT241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best business ethics class ever. Seriously, Tapia is a sweetheart. Participation and attendance is part of the grade... so if you are a notorious class skipper do not take him. Class is easy and he is awesome. Grade based on midterm, final, paper and attendance. Awesome class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2009<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring. Not English language barrier .&quot;He has nothing pertinent to add&quot; barrier. Easy class b/c he gives credit no credit grades on everything including the midterm blue book assignment. Review sessions indicate exactaly what you need to know for exams. Lectures half of quarter, students presentations remainder of quarter = total waste of time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2009<br>Class Name: PHIL200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>professor tapia is sooooo funny! he is hardcore mexican with a thick accent and he makes really funny comments. his class is easy, barley any work involved. just show up and listen to him talk. i never read any of the books and i knew everything i needed to know. only 2 tests and you can use your notes, only one paper. take him for an easy A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2007<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This dude is straight from Mexico, but is a nice guy. Knows his stuff. Easy grading. Only 2 papers all semester, no finals or midterms. Just two papers on any topic about the readings. I didn't read at all and did well cause he goes over the text every day.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/19/2007<br>Class Name: PHL416<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>When you first walk in he seems as if he is mean but he isn't. He is very knowledgeable and always willing to help. He uses the book a lot. He gives long lectures but can be funny and interesting.</div></div></div></body></html>
