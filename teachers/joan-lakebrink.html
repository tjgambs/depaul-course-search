Some of these reviews had me a little worried but this ended up being my favorite class of the quarter. Half the classes are spent watching movies. The final presentations were cool, it was neat seeing all the different backgrounds we came from. Take her if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Lakebrink is a decent teacher. She is an old lady and is extremely interested in what she teaches. She gives a lot of papers and theyre unnecessarily long. We do presentations as well but overall the work is not hard. We use the Voices of Diversity book quite a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was the easiest A I have ever gotten. We had our midterm and final on three or four concepts from our book, that's all. There's practically no homework, two papers, a few powerpoint presentations and our final ended up being a take-home. I loved Ms. Lakebrink too, she was hilarious and the class was always entertaining.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2012<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a character. Professor Lakebrink can be frustrating at times, but just talk to her during office hours to clear stuff up. She can be helpful if you ask. The grading system is nuts, but its possible to get an A. I did.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>late to class but will deduct points from your grade if you have to leave the room to pee during class. EXTREMELY disorganized and unhelpful. Seems really spaced out and confused. Does not answer questions. Grades very meticulously, taking points off for grammar and spelling mistakes. Admitted to my class that it is nearly impossible to get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2012<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has trouble finishing her thought processes sometimes. But she gives you the entire quarter to rewrite your papers as many times as you'd like, even pushed back a paper 3 weeks! Not a lot of work required either. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2011<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes a really good teacher, gives a couple of papers but is a really easy grader. Gives you many chances to rewrite your paper.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2011<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good teacher. Gives you multiple attempts at rewriting. If you tell her you have important stuff going on, she will understand and let you turn in late. Loves Coffee.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2011<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took for her multiculturalism. We didn't do anything in class except talk about readings or personal connections. I heard from word of mouth that she gives extra credit for bringing her coffee... I just grabbed a mocha from Starbucks and she was all excited, and gave me 5 pts extra credit (basically 5% overall grade)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2011<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very easy to pass this class. I think i had a b- because i turned in papers late and didn't up to some class but she bumped it up to an A- for giving her a bag of folgers coffee.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2011<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really don't understand why people are giving her bad ratings. As far as I know, this is a BS class so why do you care if you aren't learning anything&#63; I mean come on it's sophomore seminar...who gives a f&#63; She's a great teacher, we don't do ANYTHING in class except discuss random topics and watch videos.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2011<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First things first. She definitely deserves a red hot chili peppers if you know what I mean.Second, she gives you tons of extra credit if you bring her a bag of coffee. Anyway, the class was easy. The papers are long, but it's all BS topics so you can make stuff up and its all opinionated so she can't grade you down.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>overall a pretty good class. papers arent bad at all. fun assignment to go explore a neighborhood. nice teacher, easy class. def take!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/16/2009<br>Class Name: ISP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>her class was so easy. i would definetly take her again. cancelled alot of class, the papers were long but superrr easy. you can pretty much talk her into changing any assignment. and we had no final</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2009<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Lakebrink is one of the most valued assets DePaul University has. Her teaching style is somewhat unorthodox, but what matters is she gets point across. She does not have to be always right, if you can prove her wrong.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2009<br>Class Name: ISP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>lakebrink was awesome... it was so layed back we missed a bunch of classes and just had to watch movies at home and write papers about them.  she even brought treats from paris! no final no book to buy :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2009<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This woman is a joke. She cancelled 6 classes to go on vacation, then expected the class to write 10 page papers for the day she got back from vacation. She never clarified any assignments and threw half the syllabus away. I would never take her again in a million years.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/06/2009<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her for my sophomore seminar class. I didn't do a few assignments, and still got an A... obviously, an easy course. Don't take this class with her if you actually want to learn something. Also, you can convince her to do just about anything, like change the due date of assignments. And the midterm and final are both open notes</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was so FUN AND BORING at the same time. We ran the class which is why we didn't have a final. YOU CAN REVISE EVERYTHING except MidTerm and Final...and she only gives out A- and lower...i think 1 person got A's on assignments..but I ended up getting an A in the class. She's ok, but dont really expect to learn too much. I'ts TOTAL BLOW OFF!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2009<br>Class Name: LSP101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Focal Point Class. Easy class. We didn't even have a final, because she decided we didn't need to. Would take her again because she was so easy and flexible. You have to be EXTREMELY PATIENT though because she is extremely unclear on EVERYTHING.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2009<br>Class Name: FOCAL101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this was so fun. lol. easy easy easy class. just do the small reading assignments and bull **** your way out of the reading analysis and you ll be fine. she is so funny to watch. made my day every tuesday and thursday ahahahahaahh</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2009<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is a NUT! easy work but always has to challenege you because she always needs to always be right! you'll probably get a kick out of the way class works if you take her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is a multiculturalism seminar for teachers. But since you need to take that worthless class she is the one to take very flexible and accommodating. She is kinda a space cadet but she won't hold you to much. Also can get papers moved to almost any date you need.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a crazy nut but so easy and very entertaining.  You watch movies and do small assignments.  Its almost impossible not to get an A in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Considering it is a multiculturism class, Prof Lakebrink teaching it is quite ironic. Politically incorrect, yet her comments will make you laugh. Easiest A I've ever received. If you attend class, do the simple reading reviews, and sit still, you'll do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is all over the place. Some of her comments are relevant and meaningful, other stuff makes you wonder if maybe you heard her incorrectly. Does not stick withthe syllabus,and her policyon turning in work is loose at best. The most we ever learned was from a ten year old video. This class is an easy A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2007<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The subject material is very interesting and makes you think, but she is extremely dissorganized. She is late almost every class and doesn't usually stick to the syllubus. However she's a nice woman and very easy. I didn't have to work hard at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is somewhat incompentent but is not as bad as some of the people on here say she is. Class was really easy and it is true that the syllabus is not followed. She also has bad management skills but does appear to be somewhat knowledgeable to say the least.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2006<br>Class Name: ISP201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was one of the easiest teachers I have ever had.  Was not looking forward to taking the Soph. Seminar, and looked at it as a blow off class, and it was.  She was always late to class, very unorganized, and cut out at least 1/3 of the syllabus, AND I LOVED IT!!!  If you want an easy A or B with minimul effort, take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the syllabus was thrown out the window. we never kept up with the readings, we watched movies, the midterm was postponed two weeks and the final was CANCELED! we had two paper/presentations: one where we explored a neighborhood and another presenting our culture. the teacher is extremely hard to deal with....scatterbrain</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2005<br>Class Name: AS<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Lakebrink shows up 10-30 minutes late for every class, gives 30-45 minutes breaks in the middle, and is completely unprepared and unorganized for every class.  While she may have a plesant demeanor in conversation, she is a really bad teacher. Wait for another professor to offer the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All I want to know is who gave her a teaching degree&#63; Although the class is easy dealing with her is not. I completely agree with what everyone else here has said. I highly recommend avoiding her as a professor (I use that term loosely) at all costs. I learned more from others in the class then her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2005<br>Class Name: ISP110<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lakebrink comes to class 10-20 minutes late EVERYDAY! She is very unprepared and all over the place. Who gave her a teaching degree&#63; I thought opinions couldn't be wrong&#63; Apparently, in her class they are! Don't bother with her, she is a terrible waste of money and not clear, arrognat and the such.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2004<br>Class Name: EDUCATION<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst professor I have ever had in all my life.  For an education class this was the antithesis of what to do when you become a teacher.  She not only  came to class unprepared but she was very rude and arrogant.
