Always bitter, admits to drinking heavily, NEVER RETURNS WORK ON TIME.   Yes, I am upset about my grade, although it's because I actually care about my grades and a B- for a required class is a load of crap. I did all the work.   Avoid, avoid, avoid. Throw a book at her. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2013<br>Class Name: PPS250<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lectures themselves can be a bit dry at times. However, discussions can be engaging sometimes, and she truly knows her knowledge about local public policy. If you have a genuine interest in this topic you could learn quite a bit of useful or interesting information from this class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2013<br>Class Name: PPS200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a terrible teacher.  Lectures the entire class period, no student interaction, very dry.  At the end of the quarter, she did not post the grades for the final papers.  I emailed her three times about the grade and she never responded.  Three weeks later, I have yet to know my final paper grade for the class.  Save yourself the trouble.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2009<br>Class Name: DEVISSU<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OMG..most boring class in my life!!  shes a nice teacher but i would rather have a phlebotomy then sit threw another lecture again...papers are tuff</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2008<br>Class Name: PPS201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a terrible professor.  DO NOT TAKE  HER!  Her directions are poor at best.  Nobody in the class had any idea of what was going on.  She grades fairly tough, as well, but it seems harder because you don't know what she expects.  Her classes are boring, but you have to go.  She is available for outside help, but it is not always easy to do.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2008<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bennett was a pretty good professor. I had her for the Haymarket & Pullman Strike course. Workload was perfect: not too hard but not too easy either. Had a sort of weird grading scale (gave 4.4/5) on essays. Lectures were boring at times, but she knew her subject matter well. She is kind and willing to answer questions. I would recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2007<br>Class Name: PPS250<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very sweet woman and tries her best to keep the class interesting, but often times the reading for this class was just plain boring and repetitive.  Also, the projects we had to do she gave little examples of how to do them so we were kind of left in the dark.  I liked her as a person, but would probably not take another class of hers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2007<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took Tragedy of Haymarket..yes...DO NOT BUY THE BOOK! Very boring, out 15/20 were asleep. Pleasant woman, kind, but BORING!Fair grader...but boring. Watched movies time to time. Once again, BORING! Zzzzzzzz..No attend. mandatory</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/19/2007<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I feel pretty ambivalent towards her and her class.  She tries to be personable and helpful, but has trouble relating to her students and fails to lively up the subject matter.  Still, she tries, and teaches fairly well.  Plus, the material is actually quite interesting, even if her presentation isn't the best.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2007<br>Class Name: PPS201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Bennett is a very kind woman and was helpful outside of class, but her teaching style is very dry.  The class becomes torturous to go to (even though you don't have to) and you quickly loose interest in the material.  She's also a pretty tough grader despite being very unclear in class.  Stay away- especially if you're not a PPS major</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2007<br>Class Name: PPSSECT<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lectures were boring and didn't learn anything, it's pretty much not worth going  since she doesn't take attendance.  she takes forever to give assignments back, but she is an easy grader.  a great prof if you just want an easy class, but if you actually want to learn anything look elsewhere.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2007<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm surprised that she has so many good ratings.  &quot;Big Brother&quot;, I thougt that this class was going to be interesting but most of us dreaded going.  She had little knowledge of the subject matter and was always late for class.  I'm a PPS major and avoid her classes every time that I register. We had to buy three books and used them twice.  BORING!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/04/2006<br>Class Name: PPS201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great professor.  quite knowledgable on the subject matter, and openminded towards students and opinions.  exams are easy, just put time into essays ahead of time.  she is extremely kind, and unintimidating to speak with outside of class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2006<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class isn't terrible-- kind of interesting, a bit boring.

Do the work, you'll be fine.  On a side note though, she's a great teacher if you do decide to go to class :-p</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2005<br>Class Name: BIGBROTHER<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very nice, but very boring. a couple papers, lots of reading. she's easy, so easy in fact that you dont do your work anymore because there are no repercussions. if you want to be bored but want an easy class take this. if you want to be stimulated, work hard, and be rewarded, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2004<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgable about the topics, very interesting lectures, brought in Sex Pistols and Rage Against the Machine to illustrate points. Very good at translating very difficult text into easy to understand conversation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2004<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is by far the most awkard teacher i've had. she seems very uncomfortable--even nervous while she teaches. the class is worth taking if you're interested in the topic and will do the reading (which is a lot.) overall, though, it's an easy class if you can stay awake!</div></div></div></body></html>
