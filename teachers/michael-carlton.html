Gave clear parameters for exams and gave study guide with solutions.  You work thru that and you will do very well. Tests are long and tough but he uses a curve.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2015<br>Class Name: ECON305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor At DePaul hands down. The most unclear professor I have ever taken. STAY AWAY Unless you want to take the class over.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2015<br>Class Name: ECO305MICRO<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Micro covers a lot of ground. If you're not willing to work you wont do well.  The midterm was take home, 2 weeks to complete - I'm not sure how you don't get an A. He told us what would be on the exams, what to study & problem solutions.  He makes you figure out what you are doing & why.  Really learned a lot! Real life examples were awesome. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2015<br>Class Name: INTMICRO<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He had absolutely no interest in teaching. You won't learn the subject material since he will hardly bother teaching you it. This was a waste of tuition and a GPA killer.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2015<br>Class Name: INTMICROECON<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He seems like a cool guy, but he's not a great teacher. The grade was 50% midterm, 50% final, and the grading was unforgiving. The test content and class content are full of disparities. I can't find anyone who got above a D on the midterm. Wouldn't recommend. </div></div></div></body></html>
