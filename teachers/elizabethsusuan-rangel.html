She's tough, but for the right reasons. Do the work on time, ask questions, participate, show interest and you will be fine. Take advantage of her e.c. (see a tutor). Respect the no voice policy, most ASL instructors have one. You will learn a lot from her. Don't take this class unless you are passionate about learning ASL.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/19/2013<br>Class Name: ASL101103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Susan is a wonderful professor. I had her for 4 quarters and highly reccommend that you choose her as her professor. She may appear to be a bit hard but that is because she wants you to get the most out of her class. If you pick an easy teacher, you will not do well learning ASL. In the end, you will appreciate her expecting more from you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2013<br>Class Name: ASL101103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very kind and willing to help students. It is difficult to learn a new language and it is important to keep an open mind. The grading was fair and she cares a lot about her students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2012<br>Class Name: ASL103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Susan for 101-103. I learned so much in her class. She expects a lot of her students, but she helps you and makes sure you dont fall behind. I fell in love with ASL after taking 101-103. Susan is an amazing professor and if you REALLY want to learn ASL, make sure you get her as a professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2011<br>Class Name: ASL101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Susan has a very unorganize teaching style. She does not respond to emails in a timely matter, and she is also a very hard grader. If you want an A be prepared to work Triple time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/22/2010<br>Class Name: ASL101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Susan is a very unorganized teacher, her teaching style is not functional. She does not stick to her own syllabus. If there are changes to the syllabus, she will not notify you. She expects you to know the material without explaining  it. I recommend no one should take her class. Worst class ever!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2010<br>Class Name: ASL101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I usually don't have terrible things to say about professors, but I really did not appreciate Rangel's teaching style at ALL. She was very difficult and rude, unresponsive to email, and made tests/quizzes unnecessarily difficult. This was one of the most frustrating classes I have ever taken- and some of the worst teaching I've ever experienced.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2010<br>Class Name: ASL101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Rangel is an excellent teacher!  You definitely need to work hard in her class and demonstrate interest, but she is very willing to help if you are struggling.  She made me extremely passionate about ASL and I would definitely take her again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2010<br>Class Name: ASL101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You definitely have to work hard in Professor Rangel's class but I learned so much from her.  She is an excellent teacher and made me so passionate about ASL.  As long as you demonstrate effort and interest, you will succeed in her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2010<br>Class Name: ASL101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Legitimately the WORST teacher I have had in my 14 years as a student. I took ASL 101, 102, and 103 and unfortunately had her for all 3. She picks favorites and if youre not one of them good luck getting higher than a C.She has extreme attitude and when you ask her for help all she does is tell you youre not trying. I WISH I COULD GET HER FIRED.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2010<br>Class Name: ASL102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok I have to agree with the first person to comment.  I also had Rangle twice and I have never in my life had a teacher that made me hate a class so much.  She didn't take attendance unless and didn't grade homework but made up after what your grade was for each! Easily worst professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2010<br>Class Name: ASL101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So how could she be on here twice and have no comments&#63; I guess I'll be the 1st. I've had prof. Rangel for the past 2 quarters and I'd say if you want to avoid a year's worth of headaches TAKE ASL IN THE LOOP! She has no grading rubric, didn't have a syllabus 1st quarter, and seems is extremely rude to students. She also does NOT answer emails!</div></div></div></body></html>
