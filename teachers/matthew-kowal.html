Easy class. All I did was show up for class and I got a B+. Although I got some help on the final. Overall, the class is pretty easy. There were only 2 homework assignment and a Final. The homework is done in groups. Good class if you want to get a good grade but make friends.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2004<br>Class Name: MKT315<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>cute...but not too nice of a guy! is such a smartass!! he gets mad when u challenge him!! class material not too hard... take the class but don't ****him off or you're screwed!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2004<br>Class Name: MKT315<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2004<br>Class Name: MKT3103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really cool teacher, has some attitude, but very cute!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/09/2004<br>Class Name: MKT315<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is such a helpful tool in interviews, the methods you learn will really impress marketing execs.  But, it is hard to apply some of the material since he is not always easy to understand (has to backtrack quite a bit and correct himself.)
