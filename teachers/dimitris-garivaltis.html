He teaches math so you will remember the concept and does not focus on the tedious bits that you will forget. Pay attention and go to class, and SI sessions help if you struggling. You need to know algebra concepts like factoring and dividing fractions. Funny, very nice, and GREAT prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2014<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>He's ok. When teaching a new concept in class, he isn't always clear on what exactly he's doing. If you're lost and ask him, he'll elaborate, so you won't be too bad. Homework doesn't need to be turned in until the end of the quarter, which is good but can be dangerous. Get ready for a lot of book hw and online hw and quizzes. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2013<br>Class Name: MAT100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He speaks very poor English and it is often hard to understand what he is saying. He never really fully answers a question a student asks and skirts around until he gets to talk about what he wants. Very confusing as to what he wanted from his students. As someone who already struggles with math I would not reccomend taking his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2012<br>Class Name: MATH130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not as bad as comments say he is. He does go in depth on the history of problems and it gets confusing, but he's willing to help. He is a very nice guy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2012<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An ok professor. He is very knowledgeable on the subject but can confuse you at times. He teaches you to understand the theory and concept as to why a problem is solve a certain way. In my experience tutoring would have help me get a better grade. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2011<br>Class Name: MATH130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Garivaltis gives in-depth coverage of the material, with many practical examples.  In his class you actually wind up knowing what you're doing, as opposed to memorizing formulas.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2011<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is incredibly intelligent and knows his stuff but makes things VERY complicated. Even when he taught things I already knew he made it confusing. He expects you to read the book and teach yourself alot of the material. I got a good grade in the class but I spent countless hours with a tutor and studying to get it.</div></div></div></body></html>
