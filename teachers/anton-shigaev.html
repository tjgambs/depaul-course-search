They were time consuming but worth the extra 5% for each grade.  You only had to get above a 70% on each weekly hw assignment & quiz online for it to count as a 100%.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2015<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy, cares about his students doing well and will offer a lot of opportunities to redeem any low scores you may have. All 70s are rounded to 100s on HWQuizzes. Only issue here, is a language barrier- so lectures are boring and slow. But who really learns accounting from the in-class lectures anyways?  I'd take him again, and I recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2015<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very helpful! If you go to his office hours he will do problems  in detail with you. He emails the class a lot and I mean alot he truly cares about you learning the material. He offers 10% of extra credit a quarter, but it's a lot  of work to get the extra credit.  Reading the book is a must especially with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2015<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Anton Shigaev is Amazing! He talks for a long time, but just read the book and you'll be able to follow him. His tests are crazy curved and gave everyone better grades than they deserved. He's so nice and extremely helpful! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2015<br>Class Name: 102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Please spare yourself. If this is the only professor available, then hold off on this business core requirement. This class was my own personal hell. Professor is god awful.</div></div></div></body></html>
