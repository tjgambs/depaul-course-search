She's as nice as can be, but learning an entirely new language is tough; it doesn't help that she lectures in French. 4 compositions, some workbook exercises, online exercises, 3 tests, a final exam and oral exam. Class was small, prob the smallest I've had. It's a 2hour class; She gives a 10-min break.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2014<br>Class Name: FCH105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Claret is such a sweet professor. She is funny in her own way and she's the real deal when it comes to French. She offers extra credit and follows the textbook. As long as you study the material for each chapter and do the other assignments, you will be fine!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2014<br>Class Name: FCH101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Take her french class. Very good at teaching french and her class is not difficult. Offers lots of extra credit and her tests are easy. Not much work is required. She's really nice too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2013<br>Class Name: FCH106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Madame Claret is one of the best French teachers at DePaul. She is very sweet and very helpful. The best thing about her is that she is willing to take the time to help if you don't understand. She gives extra credit as well. Take her class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2013<br>Class Name: FCH105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is such a sweet professor. She is actually French which makes the language more authentic. She is very helpful and willing to explain concepts you do not understand. The exercises she does in class are very helpful, and she gives extra credit for self correcting your tests and other extra credit also. She is worth taking for French.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2011<br>Class Name: FCH106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a sweet woman! She had her funny moments and kept class lighthearted but still managed to squeeze in all of the material. Tests were hard but the final was easy if you studied. Plus she is understanding and will give rewrites and bonus points for test corrections</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2010<br>Class Name: FCH106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She wasn't a bad French teacher at all. Sometimes I found the tests a bit difficult, but I blame that on the material mostly. The class is straight forward, 3 quizzes (1 dropped), a presentation and some online work. She is helpful, there are worse French teacher than her. Don't fret if your schedule means you have to take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2010<br>Class Name: FCH106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very fun and helpful. class could be a little boring and silly at times but she really enjoys what she is doing and really want you to learn. quite easy for a college level language class. she is still one of my favorite teachers because she is very understanding if you miss class and will help you with any assignments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2010<br>Class Name: FCH102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She pretty much sucks.  She definitely knows the language especially since she is French herself, but she has no idea how to teach it.  She'll talk for a little while, read off the PowerPoint, read exercises, and then assign homework.  She does NOT know how to teach and does a horrible job at it!  If you want to take French, avoid her!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2009<br>Class Name: FCH105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>excellent prof, adorable accent, expects active participation in class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: FCH105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>tough grader, nice lady though, hard to understand when trying to speak english and explain stuff to you</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2009<br>Class Name: FCH105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a really tough grader. She's pretty nit-picky when it comes to tests and compositions. Some people love her, but they were also getting A's. If you are struggling in this class, your job is to go to the tutor (as she will always tell you) and then hope for the best. Either way, I will never take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2007<br>Class Name: FCH104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A really helpful teacher.  Even though she is French she does a great job teaching English speakers.  She often overbooked class time which was frustrating, but she was always fair with adjusting due dates etc if all material wasn't learned.  She is also very helpful, if you are struggling she would sit down and help if you ask.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2007<br>Class Name: FCH104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Clarret is absolutely adorable and was always willing to help if need be. I was sick one day and couldn't make up a quiz but she let me write a composition instead. Very helpful. Very sweet. Just a little bit hard to understand because her english isn't fabulous. She's definitely a good professor, though</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2007<br>Class Name: FCH106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's very nice and I think she really cares but the course was so easy, I didn't really learn anything. If you really want to learn french don't take from her unless you have a lot of personal motivation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2006<br>Class Name: FREN101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Clarret is a nice person, but not the best at explaining basic or elementary principles of French.  She is soft spoken and is discursive in her teaching.  However, she is an easy grader and does not collect assignments on time, both helpful for the slacker-student.  I probably would not elect to take her for higher level French classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2006<br>Class Name: FRN202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely nice and occasionaly funny.  She is French, so her accent is beautiful, and she is always willing to help.</div></div></div></body></html>
