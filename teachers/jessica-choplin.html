Would recommend! She makes really nice adjustments when classes have to be canceled or she is gone for some reason, not letting it penalize her students. She really wants you to succeed. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2015<br>Class Name: PSY373<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took her for PSY 373, class was canceled numerous times as well as having a sub a few times. Her lectures are confusing. She puts her slides up online however they are not in order and to put them in order takes FOREVER. She is a very intelligent professor and knows her stuff, however her teachings are confusing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2014<br>Class Name: 373<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div> Happiness, Judgement and Decision making,you think it will be interesting, do not be fooled!Class is boring, no book,none of the slides are online, pop quizzes every class, short papers & THE WORST A CUMULATIVE FINAL with a horrible study guide. Not a fair teacher & will give her personal favorites extra time on assign. and extra cred </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2014<br>Class Name: PSY<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher!! taking her again this upcoming autumn quarter! Papers are pretty hard but she actually gets you to think and expand your mind. Cant wait to take her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2014<br>Class Name: PSYC360<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst professor ever! She is unorganized and her lecture didn't make sense to me at all. She made me unmotivated to study psychology any more. I am a psyc major and changing my major because of her!!! Do not take her class. Avoid getting involve with her. You may ruin your university life like me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2013<br>Class Name: PSY373<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought the topics we read about and discussed were very interesting most of the time. I also appreciated the light humor she added in her power points.  The writing assignments were fun because we get to relate the material learned to our own lives. She is a very kind and helpful professor.  I would recommend her to anyone interested in Psych.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2012<br>Class Name: PSY373<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There are quizzes everyday from readings that are too long to ever get done at DePaul. Her lectures do not make any sense, she rambles on and has terrible jokes. Her powerpoints either have nothing to do with the lecture or she only leaves the slides up for less than a minute so its almost impossible to take notes. Big final and final paper.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2012<br>Class Name: PSY325<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For real though.. this class was impossible at times. Too much work to fit into a single quarter. Such a tough grader, she didn't take into account that students actually have other classes to be concerned about. The material is extremely repetitive and Choplin comes off as a tad arrogant in her methods.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2010<br>Class Name: PSYCH325<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There are quizzes everyday but you dont really need to read most of the time to get a good grade on them.  She is very understanding and a really good teacher.  I would definitely recommend taking her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2010<br>Class Name: PSY360<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I wouldn't take her again or recommend her to someone else. She is incredibly redundant and lectures straight from the book. You can learn everything she will teach you just by reading the book. I want to take another class but she is the only person who teaches it. I'm seriously considering whether I want to take it because of her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2009<br>Class Name: PSYC360<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BORING. i am a psych major, and i was seriously considering changing that because she ruined it for me. we would do the same experiment 20 times even thought only once was enough. very redundant.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2009<br>Class Name: PSYCH360<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought she was an awful teacher. She is boring, uninteresting, and tough.  I didn't learn anything from her.  Her tests on the readings are pointless as well as her class. and once again, SO BORING.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2009<br>Class Name: PSY325<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Choplin is excellent. she encourages discussion and her classes are always interesting. She is humorous- which makes lectures entertaining. you do have to do the readings because we have quizzes each class BUT you get half credit already if you just put your name on it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2008<br>Class Name: PSY373<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is wonderful. Her lectures are fun thanks to the input of everyday life experiences to the theories. NO TEXT!, but a lot of journal reviews in the first half of the course. Easy class to take!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2007<br>Class Name: PSY360<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>shes a very nice lady but definitely expects you to work hard. its an easy class as long as you keep up with the readings and material. there were no exams except for one ****ulative final at the end, but she gives you a study guide. i really enjoyed having her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2006<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought she was wonderful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2006<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is very easy. The teacher is VERY unorganized and does not know how to teach. I think she knows this and therefore expects less from her students. She is very nice but is not an effective teacher.

The book was very easy to read and rather interesting but did not really introduce any new information. She tries to get everyong involved in the class which is a plus.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2006<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>research methods 2 is a pretty boring class, and she knows this.  she tries her best to keep the class engaged and does lots of activities to keep a three hour class from becoming monotonous.  she knows what she is doing and she is experienced in her field.  it can sometimes get redundant, but like i said, the material doesnt help her. recomended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2006<br>Class Name: RESEARCHMETHOD<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lots of work, but its very well organized and laid out for you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2006<br>Class Name: PSY373<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrific professor.

I am getting a good grade but would not recommend anyone to put themselves through this horrible class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2005<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took her research and methods class and taking her next quarter for psychology of women because she's great. No book is required, she makes everything simple and she made potluck dinners for the last 2 days of class. She's very sweet and makes the quizzes worth 1 point, but gives us many to take to make the grade.  she's awesome!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2005<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I just took this class because it was required, but it actually turned out to be fun! She did not assign a textbook and had us read research studies. Some of them were really interesting. We worked in teams on projects. I highly recommend this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/23/2005<br>Class Name: RESEARCHMETHOD<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I will never take this teacher again!

Yeah, you have to work kind of hard, but you can get by. there are quizzes everyday, but they are pretty easy. 10 questions, mostly T or F. I learned so much from this class, and it had me thinking about things differently ever since the first day of class. Highly recommended!

Totally arrogant- she actually stated she &quot;believes in busy work&quot; on her intro lecture. Treats students like they are incompentent idiots, and loves to say one thing one day and another the next. Stay away from this prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2005<br>Class Name: PSYCHOFWOMEN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought that she was a wonderful teacher. I did not buy the book, and I got a B+. IF I had actually bought the book I would have done better because the final is basically all about the book, but she is a really good teacher if the final is worth a large portion of the class, and I could still do decen in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2005<br>Class Name: PSYCH242<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is totally confusing in personality and lecture.

My room mate and I had her in seperate classes and both found her impossible to deal with.  She is the closest thing to pure evil at DePaul.  She actually told me in her office that if I argued with her it would affect my grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2005<br>Class Name: PSYOFWOMEN<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good teacher. Sweet, practical, motivating. Reading IS required to pass class.(Grade is only out of 100 points,daily quizzes were 26).
