I understand we're supposed to  self-teach, but for those who have no background in physics it's hard to follow the socratic method. Unless you KNOW the subject and able to fill in the blanks, you will struggle. the class structure is disorganized & the book sucks.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2011<br>Class Name: PHY151<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm thinking he was a good, fair professor. I'm not by the way a physics major, but I enjoyed class more than my major. I may have had an unusually good class, a lot of participation and generally positive relations throughout, few conflicts, overall a good reign. The labs were also a major benefit, as there was unusually fair grading with labs.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2011<br>Class Name: PHYS152<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The only reason students don't like professor Morrison is because he challenges his students by forcing them to learn the concepts. I came from a different school and was shocked at how many students complained. These students did not go in for extra help. If you go in for help, not only will you get a good grade, you will master the concepts.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2010<br>Class Name: PHY150<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>worst teacher i have had in awhile. not at all helpful and very unclear. The tests and quizes and tests are a waste of time, seriously you sit down and look at them and feel like it would be just as useful to leave it blank. RUN!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2010<br>Class Name: PHY150<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>RUN, SAVE YOURSELF. This class is doable if you use other resources like the book, internet, or another professor. Morrison is unclear about what he wants you to learn and how to apply it to problems. He doesn't give example problems, review sessions, or prep work for exams. Also, no TA or SI leaders. If you can teach yourself, save time skip lec.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/09/2010<br>Class Name: PHY151<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Morrison was the absolute worst teacher I have ever had the misfortune of having in my entire life at DePaul University. His pit stains are disgusting, and make me heave throughout class.  He  doesn't teach AT ALL! You have to teach yourself and the extent of class is spent talking to your &quot;neighbor&quot;. Don't walk away, RUN!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2010<br>Class Name: PHY200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Morrison is very challenging. He wants you to engage deeper into the material. Most of the time, you'll have to get info from google or outside sources instead of him or the book. I had to visit him a few times to get help on lab reports and questions, but he's extremely helpful. Work hard, read, and put some extra effort for an A.</div></div></div></body></html>
