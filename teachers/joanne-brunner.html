Class is pretty simple, taught myself everything online and left the class after the quiz.  it seemed like she could really ramble on about math and go over the same problem alot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2010<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Highly recommend! Very nice and easy. She explains the materials very well! Grades consist of homework, quiz, midterm, and final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2010<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took her night class. Had already had college algebra in high school but needed to take it again. Since I knew all the material it was easy. Gives a quiz every class, 2 tests, and final. 15 minute break halfway through class. You can leave after the quiz or break and she'll never notice, and if she does she won't remember by the next week.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty good teacher. Quiz at beginning of every class, problems are the same from homework. She is there a hour before class to help with hw. Sometimes she seems a little out of it, but overall she is a good teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2008<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>no</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2008<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very nice and cares about her students. There are quizes each week, but after those most people leave. She is in her classroom an hour early each week to help with questions. I would suggest taking her; even though it was a night class she lets you out early.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2007<br>Class Name: WRC204<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hated this teacher. She gave me anxiety. Homework was useless and the final was stupid. The class was too long and I got a D...what a wase of tuition money. The next class up I got a B+ you tell me who sucks...this TEACHER!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2006<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>MS. BRUNNER IS A PRETTY GOOD TEACHER. SHE IS REAL LAID BACK AND SOFT SPOKEN. SHE'S REAL PATIENT AND COMES IN AN HOUR EARLY FOR PPL WHO NEED EXTRA HELP AND WILL LET YOU OUT EARLY IF SHE CAN. HER EXAMS ARE THE HOMEWORK PROBLEMS. SHES ONE OF THOSE PPL U CANT COMPLAIN ABOUT. SHE COMES IN, DOES HER JOB, HELPS YOU IF YOU NEED IT AND SHE LEAVES.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2006<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible Professor, you hardly can recieve help from her. When she does help you, she just shows you how to get the answer and does not explain anything. I know so many people who had to drp her class because they were all doing horrible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2006<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>alright teacher. gives a lot of busy work, and her tests can be unnaturally hard. i had her for a night class, and she always let us out like 40 minutes early. plus, you can leave after she gives the quiz and its no issue.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>MY ONE PROBLEM ABOUT THIS CLASS IS THAT SOMEHOW I MANAGED TO GET ALL OF THE HOMEWORK PROBLEMS RIGHT BUT I ALWAYS HAD PROBLEMS ON THE QUIZZES AND EXAM. MAYBE IT WAS JUST ME, BUT I FELT LIKE HER QUIZZES AND EXAMS WERE UNCLEAR AND NOT LIKE THE HOMEWORK PROBLEMS.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2006<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The only good thing she has going for her is that she is cute. As a teacher she STINKS, she is the equivalent of a bad car salesman but as a teacher, boring as hell, and snoty, I dropped her class,tok another prof and got an A with Ms. Pontaniec.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2006<br>Class Name: MAT153<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As a math major, I know Brunner shouldn't be teaching. I used to correct her errors 2-3x/class. More importantly, these errors are definitely not typos but ones that make you question if she understands basic calc concepts. She's also has a snotty demeanor and is dry in lecture. I got an A cause I taught myself, learned a lot, but no credit to her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2005<br>Class Name: WRC104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>take the night class w/ her. All you do is write notes, take a quize, and get the homework for next week. Doesn't sound bad&#63; well, boring as hell. I suggest leaving after you take her quiz and know what the homework is. As long as your not a complete retard and can read, you'll do fine.  You can teach yoursef.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2005<br>Class Name: MATH111<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Can be a very rude person. As much as tuition is, that is not acceptable .Unless you already have a very good aptitude for math, you will have problems. Dropped her and took someone else and received an A on the same material, so I know it wasn't me. Class size dwindled from week to week. Figures.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2005<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is good at helping, but is constantly wrong in examples. I honestly don't remember a class where a student did not correct her when she was giving an example.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2005<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far the worst math professor here at depaul. Her quizzes and tests were based off the h/w, but she is an EXTREMELY HARD GRADER! Her lectures are brutal and she can be very rude to students at times. Class started with about 30 students, but after the 5th week down to less than 15!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2005<br>Class Name: BMS125MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Totally cool, quizes were based of off study guides, do the work and you'll be fine, very easy and I really suck at math hence having to take 101</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2004<br>Class Name: MATH111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I advise you to DONT TAKE HER FOR ANYTHING. I beg you please don't. I am not one to deride or really down any professor but she is one of the most uncompromising and just simply worst teachers ever. Please do not take her. I regret having her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2004<br>Class Name: MATH111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is one of the worst teachers I have ever had. She makes problems more difficult than they are. And it takes her like 20 min. to do one problem. There is a weekly quiz that does not even match what she teaches.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2004<br>Class Name: MAT111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>one of the worst teachers ever! got into a fight with a student, has an attitude, does not know the material, often explains things wrong, quiz daily and material is oftentimes not like hw. MANY STUDENTS FAIL. she is just terrible</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2004<br>Class Name: MATH<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent Math professor, explains the material well.

Quizes are exactly like homework.  Gives quizes right after going over homework.  Only bad thing is that she is a math teacher that wants you to learn the definitions not just formulas.  Nice body.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2003<br>Class Name: MATH130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a fairly easy teacher...i had a good time in class...makes it easy and the quizes are very straight forward...u gotta come to class and pay attention.</div></div></div></body></html>
