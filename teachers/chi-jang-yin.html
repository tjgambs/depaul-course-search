She gives us "lectures" which is just 30 minutes of her reading off the screen. She doesn't really communicate information very well or often, but it's a simple class. If you are required to take this, it's a nice blow off.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2011<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her first impression was totally different than what I think of her now. She kicked a kid out of her class for texting, and he never came back. But she is one of the best teachers I've had. She's super charming and knows a lot about what she's teaching. Her accent is kind of thick and can be distracting, but she's really cool and interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2010<br>Class Name: ART224<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very informed when it comes to photographic methods and techniques. Always used class time efficiently. Was impressed with her organizational skills. She makes sure all of the students have a clear understanding of all information presented. Best professor/experience I have had at DePaul thus far.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2010<br>Class Name: ART332<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very smart and focused prof. Her knowledge about digital photography is impeccable. She is straight-forward, has an honest class critique that helps in a long run. Take her class if you are serious about photography.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2010<br>Class Name: ART224<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super unorganized but charming. Probably could have done more project in this class. You don't really need to buy the photoshop book she requires, unless you really feel nervous about understanding the program. She loves pretty much everything people did, not very difficult. Kind of wished it was a more challenging class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2010<br>Class Name: ART224<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Beginning Digital Photography from Chi Jang. She always made class interesting and I looked forward to class. Even though it was a night class I was never bored. Take her class, if you show interest and put effort into the 4 photography assignments you will probably get an A. Oh you really don't need to buy the photoshop textbook either...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2008<br>Class Name: ART293<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is my favorite professor at DePaul. She is helpful, inspiring and all together friendly. she is open to new ideas and is an amazing artist herself. take her class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2007<br>Class Name: ADVPHOT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She pushed my abilities as a photographer! I ended up learning better technique and conceptual developments and was able to devote the entire quarter to build my portfolio. Best professor ever!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/30/2007<br>Class Name: ART329<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I heard of her from my CTI professor. She is professional, helpful and knowledgeable in her field. Don’t be intimidated by her Asian looking…I understood clearly of everything she said. Her adv. digital photo class pushed my skills to next level and she helped me get an internship and two shows!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/18/2007<br>Class Name: ART224<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>language barrier is big problem, and if you have taken toolbox or Design 1 or 2 its all repetitive.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2007<br>Class Name: ART225<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very articulate and gets students to think rather than regurgiate. She did not put herself above us yet was still in command and she is a bit standoff intellectual.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2007<br>Class Name: ART224<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is such a nice person, and a pretty good teacher. She is very knowledgeable about her field. Try not to take her class in the morning bc she gets really into her lectures and will talk for like 1/2 the class, so thats the one bad thing about her. Other than that, if you want to be mildly challenged and have fun take her, shes great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2006<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy professor. You kinda need to take quite a few rolls of film, but she grades easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2006<br>Class Name: BEGINTPHOTO<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I want to keep her in my pocket because she's so sweet and cute and when I feel bad or have a question I can pull her out and she'll say something like &quot;Excellent work!&quot; or &quot;Yay!&quot; or pat me on the back. She's SO cool, SO artistic, SO smart, SO understanding and SO willing to help you out all the damn time. Best. Professor. Ever.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2005<br>Class Name: ART225329<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is my absolute favorite teacher at DePaul. I love her. She is extremely nice and helpful, and teaches you everything you need to know about photography. She pushes concept which is good, but a lot of people struggle on that. If you are serious about photography and/or do not know a lot about it take this teacher. She is awesome.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2005<br>Class Name: BEGADVPHOTO<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>&quot;Very interesting&quot; and &quot;I want to see more&quot; are her only critiques.  Otherwise she is an awesome person.  Instead of teaching she is sort of like a camp counselor, just there to make sure everyone is having a good time.  Her own work is great and she really encourages students to get into it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2004<br>Class Name: ART104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great teacher to pick up for art 104. She's a very encouraging art teacher and you don't need to be picasso to take the course. Definitely a good beginning course that was pretty easy and fun.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2004<br>Class Name: ART104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was always positive which was excellent. I expected it to be more of an intro course but I ended up learning and doing more than I thought I could have.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2004<br>Class Name: ADVPHOTO<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've gotten only A's in her class, but... adv. photo incorporated too much work away from actual photography (a bit overwhelming to tell you the truth). I adore her as a person, but perhaps she should restructure this class a bit.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2004<br>Class Name: BEGPHOTO<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Yin is extemely dedicated and genuinely interested in her students' success and progress. She's passionate about photography and really ignites an interest in the class. It's a good course regardless of whether or not you're an art major.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2004<br>Class Name: INTPHOTO<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is great.  It is very interesting and although it is long, it keeps you busy.  You end up loving the class and getting really into your photography.  She isn't there during lab time most of the time, and isn't great on answering questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2004<br>Class Name: BEGPHOTO<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sometimes it's hard to understand what she means, but she always means well. I loved taking this class with here. Have you seen HER work&#63; Awesome.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2003<br>Class Name: ART<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great photography prof. Give her only your best. Probably my fav. art prof at DP.</div></div></div></body></html>
