He is very engaged and passionate in promoting peace and is especially immersed. He lets you embrace creativity in everything that you do. As long as you respect the criteria he issues, then you'll be fine. One or two readings per week. Not my major, but easy to talk your way through it. Don't worry, just participate! Easy A!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/07/2014<br>Class Name: HUM200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Would not take the class again, let alone with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/25/2013<br>Class Name: PAX200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>took the SS  he is very passionate of what he teaches and wants everyone to engage in discussion and attendance is mandatory he has a sign in sheet. grades hard keeps you the whole three hours but if you think you will get out early bc it UIP you wont and if your not actually interested in nonviolent campaigns you should choose another serviceclas</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2013<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Butigan's classes were super engaging, but also laid back, and he largely let the class decide which direction to take it. He is an incredibly passionate activist for peace, and it shows while he teaches the material. Extremely warm professor who's tolerant of other viewpoints. This was an easy A for me, but you have to do the work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2012<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've taken multiple classes with Professor Butigan and plan to take more. He is absolutely my favorite professor that I have come across at DePaul so far. If you put yourself out there, he'll take a genuine interest in your life, your ideas and definitely how well you do in the class. Yes, you have to do work, but this is college guys. Suck it up.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2012<br>Class Name: PAX201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If peace is your cup of tea Ken is the man to drink it with. What a great guy. I enjoyed every class period. It was one of those 3 hr night classes but he made time fly. If you have a chance take his class. It's really powerful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2011<br>Class Name: PAX200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It was okay, the reflection papers are annoying and u really need to keep up with the readings. Dont slack off, you do need to put in the work for a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2011<br>Class Name: PAX200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very boring as mentioned, he just talks, talks, talks, and talks..he grades the papers a bit harshly in my opinion.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2011<br>Class Name: PAX392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Butigan is a great professor! He's very passionate and also very supportive of his students.  Definitely someone worth getting to know!  He includes lots of time for discussion and lets the students talk about what interests them.  Take him if you have the chance!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2011<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ken is a truly caring professor.  He has a kind heart and is very passionate about the material he teaches.  He tends to get emotional while discussing these subjects.  It's a very different learning environment because of the material and his method of teaching.  Great class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2010<br>Class Name: PAX200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great teacher and wonderful class.  very enthusiastic about teaching his studends, which i feel is lackin nowadays. topics covered in class will open up your mind to new ways of thinking.  Most papers are only a page long reflection along with a 4 page theme paper and 5 page final paper.  I would definitely take another course with Dr. Butigan.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2009<br>Class Name: PAX200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice guy. Relatively easy. Not a hard grader. Only thing is that he is VERY BORING. Honestly, bring your laptop to class or other homework because you will get bored. I strongly recommend him for Junior Experiential Learning. He's a really nice guy, and will learn from him, hes just boring. But he's not a hard professors, so easy &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2009<br>Class Name: PAX250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice guy and definitely an activist. The ideas in this course are good for anyone to get acquainted with. You might just start seeing things a little bit differently, and for the better. He's a little odd, but most profs. are in some way. I'd take another class of his.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2008<br>Class Name: PAX200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice enough prof.  Clearly cares about the subject matter but is unfortunately extremely boring.  An hour an a half class makes you feel like you've been their all day.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2008<br>Class Name: PAX250<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy, really cares about what he's teaching. He's very committed to the topic. As far as a teacher, I would say he's better than a lot of the one's I've had so far.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2008<br>Class Name: PAX200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Did anybody out there ever have him or know anything about this teacher&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;  he has zero comments or reviews...</div></div></div></body></html>
