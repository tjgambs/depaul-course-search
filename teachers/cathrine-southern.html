For any Gen Chem class, the rigor of the class should should not be reflective upon the instructor. Dr. Southern goes out of her way to make the material clear for her students. If you get anything less than an A in her class, it was because you didn't try hard enough. Take this professor and never look back.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2013<br>Class Name: CHE132<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Southern is very organized with her notes, which I found EXTREMELY helpful. The material is hard so the class will not be easy and require a lot of effort but she present the material in a organized manner and is very helpful in office hours. I highly suggest you take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2013<br>Class Name: CHE130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Southern is a great chemistry professor. She knows what she's talking about and presents information very clearly. She expects a lot of her students, but you will do well if you spend enough time on it. Chemistry is a challenging course, but having a good professor can make the difference. I recommend her!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/29/2013<br>Class Name: CHE130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Southern is a great teacher in terms of knowing the material and wanting her students to do well! Yes, chemistry is difficult, so you should come in expecting to work hard and study a lot! Dr. Southern 's office door is ALWAYS open to students with questions. Just don't come to class late...she hates that.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/13/2013<br>Class Name: CHEM132<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is honestly so kind and she definitely pushes you because she loves her job and chemistry. Her class is super difficult but she is a good teacher. If you go to her office and talk to her she is very mother-like. If you are willing to put in a lot of effort then take her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2013<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a good teacher. She grades hard and there is ALOT of work, this class kind of took over my life and I still didn't the grade I expected. But other than that she is helpful and clear and really nice, she just expects a lot out of you. I wasn't interested at all in the topic, but I learned a lot and she made it interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2013<br>Class Name: CHE130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the funniest professor I had this quarter and I wish I could have her again. The way she explains things is very clear and understandable. Dr. Southern was always willing to help me when I didn't understand. You have to work hard in her class but it's so worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2012<br>Class Name: CHE131<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor. She's so sweet and shows a lot of enthusiasm for the subject. Tests are difficult but doable, and she gives us lots of review problems and study guides/topic lists. Definitely taking her again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2012<br>Class Name: CHE130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rude and too sassy.

Really knows her stuff and is genuinely excited to teach.  No powerpoints, just written notes so be sure to go to class.  Offers lots of extra credit.

Atleast sixty pages due every other day along with questions and essays all at the same time.. I would try to avoid this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/19/2011<br>Class Name: CHE101G<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Southern is awesome!  She is a great chemistry teacher who explains everything thoroughly. If it weren't for her, I would have been lost going into higher Chem courses, because of her I am able to understand what some other teachers have a hard time explaining. She is the sweetest professor ever and I love her! Recommended! Hard, but worth it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2011<br>Class Name: CHE101G<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher, fast-paced and talks rather quickly however is extremely helpful. Is willing to help after class and is quite dedicated to her students. Recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2010<br>Class Name: CHE113<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Southern is an extremely good teacher. She is always willing to help students. She moves very fast and her tests are very difficult, but that is to be expected since chemistry isa very intense subject. If you study and pay attention and attend class you should do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2010<br>Class Name: CHE101G<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is tough and talks fast and expects a lot and is very picky about how she wants things to be done, but she will go out of her way to help you and make sure you understand the material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2009<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's the best! Dr. Southern is a great teacher whose lectures are clear and organized. Plus, she's the sweetest woman ever. True, her exams were extremely tough, but that's because she CHALLENGES students to see if they know the material. (Challenge in college&#63; Unheard of!) Got a B+, but I'd take a B in her class over an A in another's.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2009<br>Class Name: CHE113<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great professor, yes, she does go a bit fast, but if you study hard you can get a good grade in the class. Also if you have difficulty there are study sessions available, my TA was great and going to the sessions helped my understanding. Southern prepared me for upcoming chemistry classes, so her &quot;toughness&quot; really pays off in the end.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2009<br>Class Name: CHE113<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is CRAZY. She expects everyone to learn from her crooked handwriting and actually do well in her class.  Her tests are ridiculous because they dont just test the material but go above and beyond to mess with your mind.  Avoid her and take another professor.  However, its chemistry so dont expect many good teahers. Its a weed out clas</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2009<br>Class Name: CHEM111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very difficult class...prof southern is extremely deceitful in her tests....she enjoys making tests too difficult for students to understand...avoid her!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2008<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Depending on your mindset, Dr. Southern will either be your favorite teacher ever your most hated.  I loved her.  Her goal is that you truly learn the material.  You will not get by with memorizing steps to an equation like other classes. You must understand it conceptually.  Effort is rewarded as her tests are meant to push but are curved.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2008<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Chem is hard, I get that. But this prof. tries to trick you on exams. Why make an already hard subject harder&#63;  I might have thought it was just me, but I was studying with kids far smarter then I was, and they were doing just as awful. Find another chem instuctor, if only for your GPA.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2008<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor southern is one of the best professors I've ever had.  She is animated during class and always willing to help out.  No goofing off in her class, she doesn't like that.  It is very fast paced, so don't ever miss a class, but as long as you take notes and pay attention, and go to lab, you'll do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/06/2008<br>Class Name: CHE113<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Southern is a good professor who happens to teach a very challanging subject and you need to work hard.  She does go very fast, and her notes are organised by class date and chapter, and not by chapter section.  This makes it hard to know what to read compared to the lectures.  You need to come to class at 120% and always follow the lecture!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2008<br>Class Name: CHEM113<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is very hard. She moves 100 Miles an hour, and works on so many problem in class. she doesn't give u any time to fully comprehend the problem she works on, because she immediately moves on to the next. all of her notes are handwritten and she uses a projector. her handwritting is confusing sometimes, and difficult to follow. DON'T TAKE HER!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2008<br>Class Name: CHEM113<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>hard course material.  a lot of work and studying and hard tests.  overall this class is very time consuming and only a strong will to succeed will get you through.  hate towards the amount of work often makes you hate southern.  its hard not to when you really feel like you are working very hard and still receiving only average grades.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2007<br>Class Name: CHEM111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was a challenging class. Attendance isn't MANDATORY but if you do miss a class you will most likely be behind. If she knows you're trying she is more likely to help you. Very nice in office hours, but intimidating in class. However, one of the better professors in the chemistry department. Hard class, but she was helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/22/2007<br>Class Name: CHEM111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a special teacher.  She expects the class to move quickly with her crooked handwrting.  Her Tests are ludacris and is an overall disagrace to teaching! One must have the intrinsic motivation to succeed in the class otherwise you are on your own.  By the way, the TA's suck!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2007<br>Class Name: CHEM111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Southern is a godsend compared to the other teachers in this department. The previous posts don't address the fact that chemistry is one of the hardest classes offered in college and just because you receive a bad grade doesn't automatically fault the professor. Dr. Southern is helpful, witty, and smokin hot</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2007<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great professor, but like others are saying her tests are really difficult if you are ready to do a lot of studying this professor is great.  she is always willing to help out if you go talk to her during office hours or even email her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2007<br>Class Name: CHEM111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very nice but her tests are impossible she never gives enough time to finish. She tells the class to prepare to spend at least 3 hours out of class for every hour of class and she is not lying. She also is not clear about a lot of things in lecture.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2007<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great professor. Very knowledgeable and helpful. Cares a lot for her students' success. If you plan to take general chemistry, she is the best.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2007<br>Class Name: CHEM111<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She tough. Her test are extremely long and you never have time to finish. She's left handed so her arm covers the overhead while she's writing and she goes really fast, and you can never keep up in class. She's intimidating and brushes off student's questions because she rushes things and crams the lecture in. You have to come in for extra help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2007<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have never met anyone from the Chemistry department who cares about students success, but she does. She knew everyones name w/in the first week. She expects you to do a lot of work, but she works hard to make sure your understand the material. Its a hard class, but she's a great and caring teacher who loves her job and helping students learn.</div></div></div></body></html>
