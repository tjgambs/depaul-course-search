BUT, it is very refreshing to have a prof that HAS first hand experience with the material she is teaching! TAKE THIS CLASS! AND this teacher! Great person!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2005<br>Class Name: PE362<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For all you non-Fitness management students...TAKE HER CLASS!  She will try to scare you into not taking it the first day, but that's not the case.  I ended up taking the class pass/fail, and now I'm kicking myself b/c I ended up getting 110% in her class.  Take it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2005<br>Class Name: PE273<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOME teacher! VERY easy. Attendence is optional, most classes online. For final, we can use notes. Anyone who thinks midterm and final is hard should go seek psychiatric help, as no other class will be easier than this one. Material is interesting to learn (I had no interests beforehand). HOT!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2005<br>Class Name: 1STAID<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very nice,tells great stories,just show up to class, take notes and participate in the labs and you'll do just fine. take her, she's a great person and teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: PE302<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jordan's really nice and really good at explaining things.

The quizzes are easy, but the midterm and final were impossible.  There's a lot of info, and some of the info she gives you is incorrect.  BEWARE</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2004<br>Class Name: PE390<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jordan is cool and helpful. she wannts everybody to succeed. once in a while she likes to pick on something stupid a student did, usually its a male. But well worth it if you want an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/30/2004<br>Class Name: HEALTH<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice teacher, and easy on the eyes. :)  She does a lot of online classes, and is very laid back.  Take this class if you need an A!  Also, she tells a lot of good fun stories, and still teaches some information as well. :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2004<br>Class Name: PE<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jordan is cool.  Most of her tests and quizzes are on blackboard and she's not super strict about anything.  Usually pretty laid back... might make you feel stupid every once in awhile.  Good stories though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2004<br>Class Name: PE76<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Actually, there is no class at all. You may probably only see her for several times during a quarter. If you need free time, this is the best class for you to choose. However, you will learn nothing new.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2004<br>Class Name: PE111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Jordan about a year ago and she was awesome.

Students are willing to participate, the assignments are related to the course subject and helpful in understanding the material.</div></div></div></body></html>
