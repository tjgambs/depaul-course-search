The grade is 45% midterm, 45% final, 10% participation.  I hardly even read the book and got a B+.  He also has the most amazing sleeve tattoos I've ever seen--gorgeous!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2006<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's detailed when it comes to the lectures but then gives you a midterm without any type of study guide. If you don't take notes on what he says and I mean everything he says, you’re doomed. He's very monotone and dry. I wouldn't take him again if I had the choice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2005<br>Class Name: CMN346<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lectures were relatively interesting. He made it seem like the test would be easy as well. Not the case...I've never had a professor say, &quot;sorry I dont give out review sheets for tests&quot; - the tests were near impossible, and accounted for 90% of your grade...terrible terrible professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2005<br>Class Name: CMN346<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Has no  confidence, talks slow and mumbles. New teacher, needs a lot of work, unclear about examines. Would not recommend</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2005<br>Class Name: CMN<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is sooo unprofessional... talks sooo slow.. that at 8 in the morning..its so damn easy to doze off.there are no study guides.. U're expected to know everything in the reading.. and he speaks in a monologue.. NO MORE COMMENTS!</div></div></div></body></html>
