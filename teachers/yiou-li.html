Did she teach me anything? No, but she has HUGE curves on her tests and her grading scale is really easy (about a 66% is similar to getting a B).  The only way I passed her class was because of her curve and going to class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2014<br>Class Name: MTH136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her accent isn't as bad as people made it seem. she teaches really fast. she has homework due every week and has a separate grader for Homework.  she thinks that what she is teaching is really easy so she unintentionally makes you feel dumb for asking questions. She is really nice though. Her grading scale is really lenient as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2014<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Li really isn't that bad. As long as you go to class, pay attention, and do the homework you will be fine. Her grading scale is VERY easy, and she provides a study guide before each test, which is exactly like the test. Honestly, people in my class didn't do well because they were lazy and didn't put in any effort.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2014<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: C</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Li should not be a professor.  She has poor communication skills.  Unless you are a genius at math and can teach yourself from the book, then that's the only way someone should take this class.  Otherwise if you actually need someone to teach you, please save yourself and don't take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2014<br>Class Name: MAT512<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Supposed to be a time series course but was Regressin' 2: Electric Boogaloo. Got to TS wk7. Wasted 6 wks reviewing basic stats & lin regression for upper level stats course! Very unclear guidelines and lectures straight out of the book. Taught TS like regression and overlooked common TS terms. 75% of in-class final from last 30min of wk10 lecture.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2014<br>Class Name: MAT512<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible professor, avoid like the plague. She has poor communication, has a tendency to teach off book, and doesn't have a solutions manual or give example problems. You can't understand a thing she says, and she doesn't provide you with what you need to teach yourself. Made students fill in a 12x10 Excel spreadsheet by hand for the final.
