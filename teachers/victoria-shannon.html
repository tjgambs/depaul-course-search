Class time is more discussion regarding the subjects of our writing. You can revise all essays! She's a very charming professor. Really knows how to keep your attention and make an 8:30 a.m. class fly by! For WRD 103 just a couple of essays are due! She does grade really harsh- but it's a good thing since you can do revision</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2015<br>Class Name: 104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Took her over the summer.  She was really laid back and let us out early.  Pretty easy class, as long as you show up and do the papers.  You can revise your essays to get a higher grade.  You only do a few papers, no other homework.  I would take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/21/2015<br>Class Name: WORD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Being in her class was very frustrating. She plays favorites. She does not give out prompts or rubrics, so you have to do a lot of guessing on your assignments. Asked her for help on my paper, she said it was fine, gave me a B-. She's a cool woman with interesting thoughts, but I wouldn't recommend taking a class with her. She's very harsh.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2015<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is literally amazing she has so much knowledge about the world.

Her personality makes the class very enjoyable. In class discussions are fun and worthwhile. She allows for multiple revisions which can help your grade go from a C- to an A.  P.S. We didn't even use the St. Martin's Book!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Truthfully I felt this class was misunderstood. I took wrd103  to get credit, but the difficulty level outweighed the expectations. I never once believed I could get less than an A in an English class, but now I got a B. Also, too much stress on word choice, when I felt that it was most important to use sophistacated words, not simplistic.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took her for WRD103 and I've already signed up for her 104 class!

Love this class, 1010 would recommend this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Though the ignorant person may say that she spends her time instilling her own beliefs, she uses her vast amount of knowledge, which is no doubt about things in which she has interest, to prove points. She does not ramble uselessly, rather use real-world examples to teach. Incredible teacher.

She is very helpful. Do what she writes in her comments and corrections and you'll be good. Her comments are very helpful. Gives out a lot of handouts which can be very useful. She does use strong language but really helps the atmosphere become laidback.

Unhelpful, unclear on what she expects from you.IN addition, she swears excessively and doesn't really improve your abilities in writing. Take Nathan Fink instead and you won't regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2011<br>Class Name: WRD408<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely love her. She has great &quot;street cred&quot; at both DePaul and Columbia. Yes we do get off topic often but with things that are useful to our lives. She truly cares about her students which is evident. She swears a lot which is entertaining and she is not formal because her students refer to her as Victoria. I highly recommend her :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2011<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I wouldn't recommend this prof.

Very hard grader because you are not just allowed a rewrite but expected to rewrite. Large percent of grade is final portfolio so make sure you speak up in class and make yourself known. Participation and known effort on papers will help increase grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Shannon is a wonderful professor. The first couple classes are a little boring but once you and your class gets to know her and her witty comments, she is funny and easy to get along with. For attendance, you can only have two missed absences but she is really nice and usually lets us out early if we are done with the topic of the day.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No doubt she gives funny stories and is entertaining but her grading is ridiculous. I know this is college level writing but she makes it unnecessarily difficult. She does allow for rewrites but even if you do everything she says she will find even more errors and you may get an even lower grade. I would not take her again, not recommended at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>no comment. not the best of professors.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>dont bother taking her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a funny teacher and she has interesting stories.
