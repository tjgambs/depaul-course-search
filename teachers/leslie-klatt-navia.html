Does an average teaching job, but is not very clear on her explanations. Seems to be quite disorganized and is usually not there doing office hours. Not the best, but not the worst.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2006<br>Class Name: SPN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher helps out a lot, her practicum is great too, not the movie</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2006<br>Class Name: SPN102103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I dont know how somone said she grades hard, she doesnt! Our class was canceled and we always got lt out early. She is a fun person but if you intend to go on with spanish, take someone else. She is so nice, people will just walk all over her and its hard to teach a class that way.She will drop the lowest test, composition, and homework.Easy Class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2005<br>Class Name: SPN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2005<br>Class Name: SPN100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>THESE PRACTICUM CLASSES ARE A WASTE OF TIME BUT THIS PROFESSOR IS NICE AND HOT SO SHE MAKES IT WORTH GOING</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2005<br>Class Name: SPN100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Leslie is one of the best Spanish teachers at DePaul.
