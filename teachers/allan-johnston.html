He does not give back papers on time before collecting the next one so you never know what to fix on them. When he does return your papers, he scribbles on it and you must stay after class to find out what he wrote. Did not really learn anything.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is a waste of time. He takes up the entire class mumbling useless information. I did not learn anything. If you have a choice, do not take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For the sake of your sanity don't take this class or any class with him for that matter. He was the ONLY professor I had this year that almost bore me to death. Just bring your computer to class and that should help you get through it. I never payed attention to a single lecture. All the assignments were pointless and he is not helpful AT ALL.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very dull but good natured man. Prepare for journals and repetitive papers. I do not recommend him. He doesn't update anything online and his syllabus is very, very vague. In class you basically sit there for an hour and a half listening to him talk/mumble about anything and everything. No point to the class whatsoever, despite his kindness.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Allan Johnston is the man. if you are taking him for WRD 103 then consider yourself incredibly lucky. The only hard part about his class is sitting through the class without boring yourself to death. the solution to this problem is bring your laptop and do whatever you want on it. he is a very easy grader, andeasy assignments if u follow directions</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall I hated the lectures, but teacher wasn't all that bad. Papers were easy, and aslong as you participate you do fine. I'm indifferent with this class(wasnt to hard, wasnt to easy)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Jonhston is not that hard of a professor but really has no concept of grading. I had to write like 3 papers before I even got one back so I had no clue how he graded or if he liked the style of my writing. You have a bunch of bs papers and a midterm/final portfolio that contains a 15 page paper. im indifferent to his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Johnston is awful! In a class where the material is already dry...he makes it sand. He babbles for the entire 1 and 1/2 hours, and when all the material for the day is covered he decides to come up with unrelated busywork. I dreaded going to class the mandatory 2 times a week, would rather stabbed myself in the eye for an A than sit through his class. We covered bibliographies for at least 6 class meetings. I called this class Hearts 101 because I played it everyday on my phone. DON'T TAKE HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>sucks. seems like hes on something or at least like his brain is dried out from the 60s/70s. extremely boring. doesnt answer emails. grades different every paper. never uses the internet so its hard to know what is due.talks about nothingness during class.not at all helpful. do not take this man</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>pretty boring,  and he is pretty unclear on his grading system for papers, but overall not a while lot of work, coming to class is easy 3 3-5 pg papers and a 10 page research paper are what you will do, plus journals</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A.J. is an interesting character. His grading is pretty vague and varies from paper to paper. He mumbles, spaces out, and talks on and on about nothing most of the time. It was difficult staying focused and looking forward to class. Hes political though, which is pretty cool and he does try to to be fun, though he doesn't succeed all the time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>u have journal entries n reading every week n four papers throughout the course..you get to redo one of ur essays n in the end u put a port togther...he rips ur papers apart but overall hes a good teacher i didnt think i would get an A- i bs-ed my papers n did them the night before he is kind of boring so it mkaes u not want to go to class but atte</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Johnston may be a little boring, and mumbles sometimes, but he grew on me! I found him helpful, an overall nice guy, and a pretty easy grader. It's also funny when he tries to use modern slang, like &quot;sup dawg&quot;. :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Johnston is UNREAL. Not in a good way.. he is in his own world. he mumbles his words. he's not an easy grader on papers. CHANGE TEACHERS NOW do not take his class.. it's a waste of precious time and money</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It is a very easy class. You take a couple of notes and read from the book. You write journal entries every week, they are not hard at all. You have three papers to write. no midterm or final exam. he is a very nice guy!!! my only problem was staying awake during class. make sure you bring a cup of coffee with you. he isnt the most exciting man!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Johnston means well but that class is a joke. He is a very intelligent man but a terrible teacher and made the class nearly unbearable. The class is easy and he is a sweet man but if you are looking for a more interesting interactive class do not take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2008<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Johnston was my favorite professor!!! There are a few papers you have to write, but he grades very fairly and is a pretty funny guy. Not a hard class at all and he is very helpful. If you speak up in class you're pretty much garunteed an A too because he likes participation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2008<br>Class Name: ENG244<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>fun class and super easy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy, but the most BORING prof I have ever had. Had to drag myself to class each week. Grades consisted of weekly response journals, as well as 3 three-page essays on ridiculous topics-- i.e. gesures. He graded fairly easily, and the comments he left were useful, but he was so dull that I would never take any of his classes again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WORST TEACHER HANDS DOWN. Extremely unclear when it coems to assignments, hard grader eventhough he himself is not a great writer, and will not respond to any emails or phone calls. Should be teaching high school...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2007<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was an embarrassment to DePaul University.  I cannot stress this enough- DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!  If you see him for your english teacher do yourself a favor and drop this class.  All the comments posted about him are true.  I was skeptical about all the negative comments until I actually took this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I HATED THIS CLASS! He really does look like a hobo. The class was absolutely boring and a waste of my time and money. The classwork was repetitive, you can only write a paper on the same thing so many times! He never responds to emails and is impossible to reach. If I were ever to get him as a teacher again, I'll shoot myself. NEVER AGAIN!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Any person is crazy to take this class!  This teacher is not helpful and is a really hard grader.  This is a BORING class and he has no clue what he is talking about.

He looks like a homeless man. I had to struggle everyday to make it through class. The things we read about in the textbook have nothing to do with English and are also very boring. We had to write long papers on these topics, which was hard because there was almost no info. I would not want this teacher for another class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is SO boring. I had to struggle to go to class everyday. We had to write long papers on topics that have almost no information to fill so many pages.

He gives off this vibe that he really wanted to be a hippie and stand for something, and write poetry all day long, but messed up and ending up becoming a professor. Don't bother reading, because you re-read everything in class. 2 page journals every week, papers are also pretty frequent. Find someone else</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hes a really nice guy, but he blabs about bull the whole time.

The material was VERY boring and so was the class. Hes not bad though. Easy grader, easy work. So basically he is an EASY teacher but kinda boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2004<br>Class Name: WRC108<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>well this guy is BORING and an OK grader too, b/c  he seemed to give everyone B's. He is ok but  there are other teachers that are more better and fun. He also gives out quizzes and lots of reading. So if you want someone boring, lots of papers, reading, and quizzes, then go for it otherwise don't.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2004<br>Class Name: ENG101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is a lot of writing-a paper per week if not two.  He does not grade hard,though.  Class time is very boring and most of the students don't listen.  Overall, I would suggest trying to find a different teacher if you get bored easily.</div></div></div></body></html>
