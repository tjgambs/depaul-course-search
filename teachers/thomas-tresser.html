The material should be interesting, but he does a good job keeping it mundane. Many, many busy work assignments - 3 long papers, 3 presentations, 2 short papers and a weekly homework assignment for a 10 week class. He schedules the class really tight and we almost always run over. Skip it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2008<br>Class Name: PAX250<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm sure he has good intentions, but Tresser is not a good teacher.  Some people are made to act and some to teach, and he should act.  Don't take his classes.  He's self-absorbed, the material is dull when it doesn't have to be, and the projects are lame.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/31/2006<br>Class Name: CULTACTIVIST<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's obviously passionate and knowledgeable about what he teaches and very creative. My major complaint is receiving NO feedback during the course, then left to do a TON of work at end w/out guidance. He has a lot of potential, but should guide and empower students, rather than lecture hypercritically or cut students off mid-sentence.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/28/2006<br>Class Name: CULTURACTIV<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was Tresser's first time teaching the course, so we all cut him some slack for a few scheduling glitches (papers & presentations due same day). He loves what he does, we loved learning how to stop being apathetic Gen X-ers and get involved. Class is worth taking, its a 101 on how to do something about politics that you're not cool with.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2006<br>Class Name: CULTURALACT<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2006<br>Class Name: CULTURALACT<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tom has a passion for this subject.  I loved the way he creatively combined his theater background with the organizing aspects of cultural activism.  Every week he featured an artist, showed a film and played music to stress the different viewpoints on activism.  One drawback was planning two final assignments at the same time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2006<br>Class Name: AI148<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although the initial subject matter was interesting, the class itself was very superficial, disorganized and poorly planned out.  I learned very little, and the teacher did not give adequate feedback.</div></div></div></body></html>
