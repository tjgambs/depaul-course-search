Often he doesn't return e-mails and when he does, it is like 3 weeks later. Talked about law school entirely too much and gave us busy work. I did not learn a thing. Did not seem organized (i.e. uploading to COL during class) and appeared to be teaching on the fly. Not worth the money.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2008<br>Class Name: IS456<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was comfortable, and pretty decent.

Pretty enjoyable, and cool guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2008<br>Class Name: IS401<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2008<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good teacher and an easy A. I actually learned a lot in this class. All assignments are done in class, except for the final project that requires 3 hours max out of class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2008<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is great.  He shows you every detail of the assignments and helps you along the way.  This class does require some time, and the final project is a little time consuming, but he is always there to help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2007<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>THIS CLASS IS SO EASY....JUST TAKE IT....the teacher is a JOKE</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/03/2007<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had no interest in this class prior to taking it. He was a really nice guy that knew a lot about the subject and although I felt that he went fast sometimes, I learned a lot that will be helpful in the future. Most of the class was spent on him lecturing and showing us what to do on the projector, we usually had class time to work on assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/01/2007<br>Class Name: ECT350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Burns is cool. Period. The guy is down to earth and understanding as hell when it comes to students needs. No textbook, but plenty of assigned readings. I took the class in the summer and got an A. Other than that I can completely see him as being awesome in any other subject as well. He expects what any professor would. Respect.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2006<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Al was the man.  The class was very easy.  Half the time was spent in the lab, the other in lectures (which were boring as hell).  Assignments were easy as long as you followed his examples.  Quizzes weren't too bad, he gives study guides for all three.  Ended up with a solid A in the course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2006<br>Class Name: ECT250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Al, is a good teacher. His lectures are relevant and his assignments and test are geared not to what you can memorize but what you will remember later on in life. Good teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2005<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice guy. Pushes assigments back if you need him to. Class seems really easy until you take a midterm or final. The material on the test is completly different from class. The tests really mess you up in the end. Think twice before taking his class. Nice guy bad teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2005<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very laid back teacher.  He grades a lot nicer if it is an introductory class.  He lectures mostly throughout the class and doesn't give much time for in class-work and questions, but he will take questions during his lectures and thoroughly explain them.  He'll extend assignments by a week if the class wants him too most of the time.  Nice guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/23/2005<br>Class Name: IS421422<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very insulting, belittles students. For a grad school instructor he sucks, one of the worst teachers I have ever had. Hard grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2005<br>Class Name: IT215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor @ DePaul.  VERY knowledgeable with real-world experience.  He makes class interesting and will definitely keep you awake.  Funny, smart and like I said earlier, the best prof @ DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2005<br>Class Name: IT215<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>although burns has vast knowledge about the subject, his manner of teaching is lacking.  he does have his funny moments, but they are few.  his lectures are mostly boring and make you want to leave class.  some students usually do leave.  he's not a terrible teacher, but if you can, take some else.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2004<br>Class Name: IT201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Al Burns has got to be the best teacher i have had so far.  I recommend everyone take his courses if you can.  He makes the work as easy as possible and is more than fare.  He teaces the material so that you can stay interested.  He is hella funny.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2004<br>Class Name: IS201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take Burns! His class is easy, easy assignments, but you'll learn sooo much especially if you are still trying to figure out if you want to major in any IT related fields.  Plus he has a sense of humor, very helpful, and very laid back.</div></div></div></body></html>
