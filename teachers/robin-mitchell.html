READ,TAKE NOTES  SPEAK UP AND GIVE 100% ON YOUR PAPERS!! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2014<br>Class Name: WGS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Mitchell scared the hell out of me at first, but she is the most inspirational and best professor I have ever had. I can honestly say that this class changed my life, today was the last day and I almost cried. She is so incredibly passionate about her work and respects her students so much. You might not get an A with her, but please take her!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2014<br>Class Name: WGS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>This class changed my life as a student. Robin teaches each student the value of their word and opinion and brought that out of every student in the class. The way that she taught us to make and write an argument will stick with me throughout the rest of my academic career. She knows her stuff and loves every class that she attends with passion. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2014<br>Class Name: WGS100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very intimidating at first, but it is because she is passionate about what she does. She expects a lot out of her students because she knows you can do it, this is not a class to take for an easy A, you really have to work for it and engage in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2014<br>Class Name: WGS250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Mitchell is the best professor at DePaul, undoubtedly.  This is the lowest grade I have received so far, and this is still the best class.  She genuinely cares about her students and will do whatever you need; she is always there for you.  You will learn more here than anywhere.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2014<br>Class Name: WGS255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B-</div><div id="right"><div>If you want an easy A, or frankly if you're a freshman or have a case of senioritis, I wouldn't recommend her. She definitely has her opinions, but if you come back at her with an educated and well formed argument that contradicts hers, she will definitely listen. VERY HARSH GRADER! Expect to work your butt off for an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2014<br>Class Name: WGS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best professor and person I have ever met! She is a tough grader but if you go to her office hours you will get a grade boost because she helped you with the assignment and gave great comments/ feedback. She is passionate about her work and her lectures and discussions are always interesting. I am taking as many classes with her as I can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2013<br>Class Name: WGS255<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Robin is ok, many students are super into her teaching style and I am not. She's very into herself & not very objective. I think she can be a bit harsh and I can't say I felt empowered. She definitely takes a tough love approach...something I'm not into. Choose at your own risk.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/30/2013<br>Class Name: WGS255<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Mitchell is a fantastic professor. She's brilliant, funny, helpful, and makes every discussion both welcoming and engaging. I absolutely loved her class, and it was a joy to learn from her. Do not pass up an opportunity to take a class with her! I learned so much, and although some of the papers were challenging, it was well worth the effort!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2013<br>Class Name: WGS250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have never met another professor who has empowered me like Mitchell. I left every class feeling like I was important and powerful. TAKE HER!! Do not let an opportunity to learn from her pass you by. She is brilliant, passionate, and any class with her is bound to change your life. Her coursework and grading are fair and she is always open to help</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2013<br>Class Name: WGS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Mitchell is amazing. Best professor I have had at DePaul. She is super passionate, knowledgable, and really cares about  her students. She excels at facilitating discussion in class, and her classroom is a very supportive safe space. Her manifestos class is GREAT as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2013<br>Class Name: WGS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Robin is hands down one of the best teachers I have ever had. Her classes are not easy, but she pushes you and helps you become a much better thinker. I love how passionate she is about the material, and how she treats her students as peers rather than as subordinates. She truly cares about her students and how well they understand the material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2012<br>Class Name: WGS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Phenomenal professor. Definitely in my top 5 class/professors so far Really, you should do everything you can to try and take a class with her. Definitely pushes you but is welcoming, incredibly helpful and encourages different opinions and discussion. You will have fun and have a new opinion of school and the world after. You will not regret this!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/11/2012<br>Class Name: WGS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an INCREDIBLE teacher. She will take the time to further explain anything you ask of her. She truly treats her students as adults, and thus expects her students to act as such. If you want an A in the class, you MUST read and thoroughly understand the material. If you're willing to put in the work, take her class. You won't regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/06/2012<br>Class Name: WGS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is honestly one of my favorite teachers at Depaul, It was only her first year here but she just clicks in. She treats you as a serious student even in WGS 100 only out of respect.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2012<br>Class Name: WGS255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful teacher! Kept my interest all the time and facilitated amazing class discussions. She really takes participation into consideration, so speak up in her class! Very helpful if you reach out to her, especially going to office hours. She's just a really cool, funny and energetic teacher. Will be taking her again in the future if I can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2012<br>Class Name: WGS101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is by far the best teacher here at DePaul. I truly consider her to be a true teacher. She never refused to help us, even if we needed someone to talk to about personal issues she was always there. Attendance is mandatory, and i definitely suggest you keep up with the readings. They are not difficult and she ALWAYS helps :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2012<br>Class Name: WGS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AMAZING teacher. Makes the class ridiculously fun, but she teaches you from an unbiased view and really empowers you. I hope I can take another class with her again. If you get her as a teacher you will not be disappointed. HIGHLY recommend.</div></div></div></body></html>
