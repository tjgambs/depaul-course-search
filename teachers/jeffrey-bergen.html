The grade is based off of quizzes and a final. The quizzes are 20 minutes long, and they're based off of the HW.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2006<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bergen was great, he made corney jokes in class but I thought it was funny. The class I took was calculus so you have to do a bit of work. If you do the homework and the problems in class the quizzes are a breeze, tutoring is offered, I would take it again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2006<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take this class if you have ever taken Calc before, because it will be so easy!  He never tests you on the hard problems, only easy ones.  I highly recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2006<br>Class Name: ISP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice guy!

He breaks things down to their simplest forms so that anyone can grasp the concepts. Doesn't give too much homework, prepares you well for the quizes and final exam. Favorite math teacher in life!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2006<br>Class Name: MATH<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sooooooooooo easy! On tuesday he gives you a &quot;practice quiz&quot; and gives all the answers then thursday the &quot;real&quot; quiz is the same thing. The final is the same way. It'd be hard not to get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2005<br>Class Name: CALC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy and teaches so you can understand the concepts.
