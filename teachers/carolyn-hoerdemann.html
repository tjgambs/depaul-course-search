The class is pretty easy but she can get a little crazed about her artistic techniques. She's very particular about how you interpret things. Attendance is a must, as is participation. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2013<br>Class Name: PRF290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best ladies you will ever meet. I went from never wanting to go to class to missing the class now that it's over. We changed our entire class syllabus and she lead us gracefully through the quarter. Amazing class, amazing people, amazing lady. I am truly sad it is gone - you should take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2013<br>Class Name: PRF290<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Carolyn's cool. Our performance class veered off track though and turned into a big political activist-type project, so didn't get to do many exercises, skits, or see many plays. She has a good heart though, if you're looking for a quirky but comfortable atmosphere this is the class for you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2012<br>Class Name: PRF290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the best class I have ever taken at DePaul. Carolyn is so laid back, hilarious, and chill. Attendance is mandatory, and don't be late. Relaxed atmosphere. Be prepared to make friends in this class and come out of your shell a little bit. No tests. You will see a few plays on your own and as a class. TAKE THIS PROF!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2012<br>Class Name: PRF290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class being a Monday night class, I was positive I was not going to look forward to going this class. But I was wrong. Carolyn made this class so much fun that it was the only one I looked forward to going to all week. We came as strangers, and left as a family and friends. Wonderful professor. I will never forget this class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2012<br>Class Name: PRF290<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had doubts prior to entering the class, but she made it a fun learning environment. New friendships were made. We entered as strangers and left as a family. Truly a fun class. You really do explore your inner self. Just be on time, don't be obnoxious or she'll throw a fit. Otherwise she'll love you and give you an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2011<br>Class Name: PRF290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Carolyn is great. There are three ways to get an A in this class. BE ON TIME, all day, everyday. MAKE AN IDIOT OUT OF YOURSELF AND BE OKAY WITH IT. Lastly, GO SEE TWO PLAYS DURING THE CLASS. I looked forward to going to class everyday.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2010<br>Class Name: PRF290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought I would hate that class and her. But the first day she makes everything so comfortable. I was suprised by how into I got. The one thing I have to stress BE ON TIME and by on time 5 minutes early b/c she considers 1 minute late! Great teacher great class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2009<br>Class Name: PRF290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome class, cool lady! We got to let loose and perform skits in front of the class. Very laid-back. Easy class, take it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/17/2009<br>Class Name: PRF290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is incredibly helpful, caring, generous, and entertaining (and I mean that in the best sense; her sense of humor is second to none). Her class was deeply fulfilling and stimulating. Her grading is on the easy side of average, but her assignments can be surprisingly challenging. Without a doubt this was the most fun I ever had at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2007<br>Class Name: PRF290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nicer person I've ever met. She is a wonderful professor, very helpful, fun, and passionate on what she does. There is no right or wrong in her class. She always encourages her students to be creative and to step out of the box and confort zone. Very easy and fun class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2006<br>Class Name: PRF<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2006<br>Class Name: PRF<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Respect her, BE ON TIME, and everything is okay. She is really cool, and honest.  I would trust and respect her opinions about the fine arts.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2005<br>Class Name: PRF290<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher and fun class. She can get a bit impatient when people don't understand what she is explaining. She is helpful and makes the class fun and is dedicated to her work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2005<br>Class Name: PER290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>make sure u go to class everyday, and u'll be fine</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2005<br>Class Name: PRF290<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>fun class but she is very unclear when she gives assignments so you gotta clarify and make sure on your own when things are due..otherwise she gets moody and pissy</div></div></div></body></html>
