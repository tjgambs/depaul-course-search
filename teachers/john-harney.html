He's a nice guy just way too strict. He gave me a C- for my paper even though I followed his guidelines. I tried to get a hold of him but he never got back to me. This was the worst grade I received at DePaul and I would not recommend him for a 100 level history class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2013<br>Class Name: HST232<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I found him to be really self-absorbed and disrespectful toward students. He seemed more interested in hunting for faults in our work than he did in helping us understand the material and do well on assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2012<br>Class Name: HST163<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No matter how good you are at history, do not take this class with him.  He is too strict and the way he grades is too hard and unrealistic.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2012<br>Class Name: HST163<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class content was interesting, but this professor is way too strict. Being good at history could mean nothing in his class. His way of teaching would be effective had he not been strict at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2012<br>Class Name: HST233<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you're interested in China you will probably love his class but if, like me, you could care less than I recommend not taking his class. Requires a lot of reading including two 400ish page books, weekly chapters out of the text book, and weekly readings from D2L. He's also the toughest grader I've had at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2012<br>Class Name: HST163<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall he is a good teacher. Boring class- full of lecturing and taking notes. He requires a ridculous amount of reading every night. Interesting class however</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2012<br>Class Name: HST233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An Irish professor teaching a class about Chinese history was fun to say the least!  He has high expectations for the class, but is willing to help in anyway possible, especially because Chinese history can get sort of confusing at times!  There are two papers based on two books you will need to read, 8 quizzes, a final is two essays.</div></div></div></body></html>
