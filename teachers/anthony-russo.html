Always full of energy. I would really recommend him for mng 300. Midterm and final exams are both hard so you better study in advance. I loved going to his class and enjoyed every lecture. Has many stories to share due to his hands on experience as owner of an equipment company.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2012<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He takes everything from the handouts & movies so the book is not necessary. What bothers me about his testing is he says "choose the best answer" "in my opinion there's a best answer, even though they all look very alike." So you have to memorize the definition exactly how they are on the handout. The good thing is if you get answers on the midterm wrong you can appeal your answers and write to him why you chose what you did & he might change it from wrong to right.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2011<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's got a lot of energy for an 8:30AM class. Probably would have enjoyed him a little bit more later in the day. Always makes class interesting but he comes off a little too strong for my tastes. In short, not the best but not the worst professor I've ever had.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2010<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he great guy really loves to teach and gets super excited. his midterm is hard so you better study. group project. overall i loved this class i enjoyed coming to every class even though the midterm and final are hard its college you have to study</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2010<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's an ok teacher. He's really into the class but his exams are really hard. If you miss a class there's a chance that what he discusses will be on the exams. Gives out a ton of handouts and tells you to study them for exam. I'd recommend taking a different teacher for MGT 300.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2008<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is an ok professor.  i mean,i bombed the midterm and thought i did good...the average was a 64%.  on the final, though, something miracously happened bc i received an a- in the class.  he is very laid back, but just because he is like that does not mean that his tests are easy...memorize a lot of words and youll do fine</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2007<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Everything said by the other reviews is relatively accurate.  But, I can offer all of you a trick to this class.  Skim a few books about mgt (Jack Welch - Winning, Jim Collins - Good to Great)half of his tests are short answers; meaning, if you justify your argument, you get it right.  He allows you to argue multiple choice too.  I took an 80 to 86</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2006<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dont let him fool u with his laid back ease. His midterm and final is not easy. Gives you lots of material to read. Essay questions are based on the handouts so make sure you memorize them. Very nice guy tho.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2005<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is not a great teacher, in fact, he really can't teach. study like hell from the handouts and come to class because midterm and final are hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2005<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BEST PROF. AT DEPAUL!!!  TAKE HIM AND YOU WILL ENJOY THE CLASS!!!  TESTS ARE MOSTLY FROM HANDOUTs, MAY BE A LITTLE HARD, BUT IF YOU JUST STUDY THE HANDOUTS YOU SHOULD BE FINE!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2005<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>it's not that Russo is not a good prof, the subject itself is tedious. u'll be fed TONS of technical terms that u will hardly ever use in real life, yet he expects u to memorize them for the exams. for me, this class was a huge waste of time; way too much gobbledygook...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2005<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really nice guy.  That is pretty much it.  He can't teach very well and his tests are very hard.  I would recommend taking him if you like to teach yourself or want a class that you like going to.  If you want to learn in class he is not a wise choice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2005<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For a first level Management class he is not to bad. He is a really nice guy but he cant teach. Study study study the handout and review articles and take notes on movies thats the midterm and final. He tries to hard to be a good prof but in all reality he just owns a buisness that did well. Thank g-d im not a management major or i would be screwed</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2005<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy;talks about his business a lot and spends 1/3 of class time rambling about business news. Doesn't check attendance; makes the class look easier than it really is - the exams are not as easy; study the handouts carefully and come to class cuz he gives essay questions based on movies and articles covered in class. Assigns a group paper.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very energetic. Has real experience with management. The midterm and final are fair, material comes from book and handouts. I don't know what people are thinking when they say he is an unfair grader, if you don't try (at least skim the handouts) the tests will be hard! I recommend professor Russo!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2005<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A nice guy, but knows nothing about corp. management. His tests are really long, very subjective & he's an unfair grader. He talks about everything else in the world except for management. He has good intentions, but he's really full of himself & has a big ego. He likes to be the center of attention</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2004<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT INSTRUCTOR MUST TAKE HIM FOR MANAGEMENT COMPARED TO ANY OTHER PROFESSOR DONT WORRY ABOUT THE TIMINGS IT IS A FUN CLASS YOU WILL STAY AWAKE THROUGHT OUT MOST OF THE QTR.
