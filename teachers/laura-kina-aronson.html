I was scared to take her class, because I'd never painted before, but she was so helpful and never made me feel stupid. I learned so much and feel like I became a better artist. And as for supplies, she says if you can't afford something, you can borrow from her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2011<br>Class Name: HON301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher--Extremely helpful and creates a very kind and accepting environment in the class. I'm not particularly interested in the subject matter, but if you are you should definitely take this class with her. I don't think anyone else could teach it better. 1 midterm paper, 1 final project, and weekly readings=minimal workload.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2011<br>Class Name: ART110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was really nervous for this class but it was my favorite! Laura is extremely helpful and just wants everyone to succeed. Class was always fun, we played music, had hilarious conversations, and went on a couple field trips. She's gives lots of feedback with projects and is definitely a fair grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2011<br>Class Name: ART105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was ok.  She was kind of vague on what she wanted from us.  We had three main projects which weren't too hard- however, if she doesn't like you're idea you will probably get a bad grade.  She also made us buy a TON of supplies which cost a lot. Oh and we didn't even use them all.  She's nice but just eh. I recommend if you're good at art</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2010<br>Class Name: ART105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Only class at DePaul I have recieved a C in. Took  class for fun and it ended up screwing up my GPA. She said I would be fine and then screwed me over. Had perfect attendence and kept up with all the work but it wasnt good enough for her. She was very condescending and judged  art to much with her own views. I will never take a art class again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2009<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes a great teacher and makes class fun. There is A LOT of writing involved but its not bad, and the best part is the class discussions cuz everyone gets invloved and gets to know eachother.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/24/2008<br>Class Name: ART210<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably the worst art I have ever had. She has a way of making you feel stupid about your ideas and is condescending. She does not create a welcoming environment. After a few bad incidents of talking with her I avoided her as much as I could and dreaded going to class. Some people really like her though, so who knows.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2006<br>Class Name: ART105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great teacher. really clear with directions, gives solid demonstrations of how to use the stuff she has you buy, and will help you if you need it and let you do your thing if you don't. a+</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2006<br>Class Name: ART105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Laura Kina is great. Her expections are reasonable, so don't be scared to take the class if you are not an artsy person. She really cares about students and seeing them expand their understanding of design. She is highly qualified as well. Enjoy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2006<br>Class Name: ART105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>gread class.  lots of group work and dialogue between students.  but when it comes to essays and grading she's stingy.  she's thinks she's an english teacher and grades harder on her essays than any english teachers i've had.  tends to focus on small details rather than big picture.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kina tries to get the whole class involved. She had very creative ideas on how to make the class interesting. I would highly recommend. She is also very nice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2005<br>Class Name: ART105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For my first studio class, I was really impressed.  She is a great, very knowledgable and helpful teacher who made class fun (even at 8:30 a.m.) She has high expectations, but really helps you meet them, and even allows you to re-do projects to earn a higher grade after critiques. Highly recommended</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really interesting class.  Grading was much harder and strict than needed to be.  Overall, however, she was pleasant to have around and assigned interesting projects.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2005<br>Class Name: ART101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was a great teacher and always was there to help.  Gives alot of class time to do all the projects so there is not much work out of class.  Grades very fairly if not generously.  I would definitely take her every chance I got</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2004<br>Class Name: ART<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is really fun. You get to explore &quot;your&quot; own ideas and develop then, with the prof's help. She's nice and interesting, but a hard grader and wants some things her way. If you are serious about art and willing to spend the time on projects up to 9 hours outside of class, take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2004<br>Class Name: ART105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Kina is a great art teacher.  Very enthusiastic and makes the studio time cool, laid back and fun.  She is a tough grader and expects you to do the work.  She really works with you and helps you think things through.  Take the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2004<br>Class Name: ART105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Teacher! I'm not an art major but I really enjoyed her class.She works with you and your ideas and doesn't try to change them. She's a pretty easy-going person.Let's u play music in class and gave an easy midterm. I'd refer her to friends.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2003<br>Class Name: HON202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Inspiring professor who works with you and encourages your ideas, I would deffinately recomended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2003<br>Class Name: HON203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a really good studio teacher and cares more about the idea rather than your abilities as a artist...definitley take her for the studio portion of HON202...you won't regret it...there field trips too!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2003<br>Class Name: ART106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher really made the class fun and educational.
