If the topic is new to you - recommend attending lecture. Will answer most of your questions but not all. Overall the more effort you put in, the better the grade, for a challenging topic.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/06/2012<br>Class Name: ACC560<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She sometimes become confusing on certain questions by changig the answer to the question she already answered... she has a very friendly personality and wants to teach people, so do not hesitate to ask the questions and she will clarify things for you on the spot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2011<br>Class Name: ACC563<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very boring presentation. Did not seem knowledgeable about the subject (Partnerships--she has corporate background). Read through approximately 180 power point slides tonight, basically verbatim.  Overall her tests were easy if you studied her power points. Going to class didn't add much except the solutions to the examples in the power points.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2011<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty easy class. Classes are all powerpoint based. You dont have to go class, but if we want the answers to the questions within her powerpoints,you do. Midterm, Final, and case study (pretty easy case study too). Midterm and Final she curves. Test are somewhat difficult, but I pulled off an A with minimum studying. And dont buy the book.</div></div></div></body></html>
