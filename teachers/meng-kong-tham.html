First impressions mean a lot to him so come to class prepared, participate, and laugh at his jokes! Twinkle Twinkle Little Star is his FAVORITE song! He plays it every class period on the piano...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He makes you feel like a burden when asking questions. He also belittles those that are not part of the School of Music who are involved in music classes. Two things that got on my nerves was the fact that he would talk through/during tests/quizzes. It was not uncommon for the same lecture to be repeated multiple times on several occasions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy.  Knows his stuff and takes an interest in the students.  Subject matter is kinda dull and he puts a lot of importance on having the book. I would recommend since its required</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man is really nice, too bad he is retiring soon. As long as you show up to class on time and daily and put for some effort you will be on his good side.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2005<br>Class Name: MUS270ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have taken 2 classes with this man, so I might be the foremost authority on his teaching abilities.  ISP200 was pretty straightforward, no challenging material.  However, doing the outlines is a ****.  Expect to spend a few hours on each unit. MUS270 was the biggest joke.  I've not had an easier class.  Plus, Tham is hilarious.  Make fun of him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Most boring man ever! So unclear! Kill me! I hate this class.

We only went over China, Japan, and India which are interesting but we spent so much time on them. I wouldnt recomend this class to anyone!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>PROFESSOR THAM IS A GREAT TEACHER, I'VE LEARNED SO MUCH IN HIS CLASS, I REALLY WANT TO TAKE ANOTHER ONE OF HIS CLASS, HE MIGHT NOT BE THE EASIEST TEACHER BUT IF YOU PUT YOUR EFFORT INTO THE CLASS YOU'LL DO WELL</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Tham is not as bad as everyone makes him seem. He is a nice man, there are 3 EASY quizzes, and he tells you what the final will be. One easy paper, and the outlines are Very easy. Anyone who gets a bad grade, get out of college.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2005<br>Class Name: MUSIC<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2004<br>Class Name: MUS270<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a nice man.

He seems to think the world's people consists of 99% China... I complained about this fact in my final paper and he claimed we didnt have enough time... Very difficult for a non-music major class...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/09/2004<br>Class Name: MUS270<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the worst professors ive ever had.  Basics of the course are very unclear and he gives you no help on what to study for.  No guidelines to what will be tested on.  Would advise against the world music class, he seems biased towards only Asian music</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2004<br>Class Name: MUS<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2004<br>Class Name: MUS270<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this is the worst teacher ive ever had at depaul university.  if you like bad grades, take this man.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/06/2004<br>Class Name: MUS<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm sure he is nice, but unless you are prepared to hybrenate for 10 weeks, avoid taking him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2004<br>Class Name: MUS<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>please get on his good side.
