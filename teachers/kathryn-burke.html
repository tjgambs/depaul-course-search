Doesn't do anything productive. Takes forever grading works. Its not even like there is alot of grading either. assignments are 3 essays which are about 1 1/2 pages long and than there is a midterm and final paper. which right now, none of the Phl 100 spring 2008-09 has recieved our grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is pretty easy but im pretty sure u can find an easy teacher without all the baggage this one brings with her. Its beenabout two & she has not even post up the grades. As a grade everyone in the class recieved a IN which means incomplete. Most of the students emailed her including me about it but she didnt respond, she never responds.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was an easy teacher who was interesting enough but when the time came for her to actually be usefull and available for feedback, she wasn't there.  Class was cancelled at a time when assignments were due and she says shes available to send paper drafts to but she doesn't read them.  There are better teachers for her classes than her.  Rethink!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great professor.  She is very clear and helpful for an abstract subject.  Easy to listen to her lecture.  Definitely take her if you have the option.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was totally awesome at sitting down with you and helping you understand what exactly was going on. I would totally take another class that she taught any day.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>easy teacher. she helps understand the concepts because they are confusing. she doesnt follow her syllabus if students feel confused, so she makes sure everyone is on the same page. and there is a midterm and final but questions are given prior and answers discussed prior as well. Overall, nice and helpful teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has a great accent.
