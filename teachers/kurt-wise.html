You'll work your butt off, but it is solid practical knowledge. He'll talk to you a lot about your future in PR, which is amazingly helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2006<br>Class Name: CMN337<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a required class- but man it sucks. There is really no lecture, he just has you work in your group EVERY DAY ALL DAY on this damn project (which your entire grade comes down to). There are 2 short (10 multiple choice) quizzes and then the BIG presentation. It's sooo tedious but he'll help you. He also talks a lot about how to get jobs in PR</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/04/2005<br>Class Name: CMN255<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kurt Wise makes learning fun.

Teaches more than just the textbook, his lessons can be applied in every way possible. Everyone should take him if they have the chance, his enthusiasm and energy is contagious. You will remember what he taught you long after you are out of college.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2005<br>Class Name: CMN255<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doesn't talk much about the text, more about how PR people work in every-day life. He loves giving career advice. He's SO enthusiastic about the course. The final project is group based, takes a little work, but not hard at all. His tests are very easy, just study.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2005<br>Class Name: CMN338<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WISE ROCKS</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2005<br>Class Name: CMN350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2005<br>Class Name: CMN338<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best prof at DePaul- hands down.

What a bad-ass! So straight-forward its sick.  If your assignment sucks youll know.  If its great youll know.  Wise is the practitioner and professor all teachers standards should be held too.
