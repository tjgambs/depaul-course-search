Closed book exams, which seemed unnecessary for this class. Easy homeworks/tough exams, but he seems to curve the final grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2008<br>Class Name: CSC451<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>To be brutally honest, be warned! Though this class is not that difficult, he makes it confusing. Even though you ask him for help, you may still end up being confused and he will make you feel really dumb. Save your $$ and take a different instructor for this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2008<br>Class Name: CSC549<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I complained to dean about this guy. He's awful. The assignments were jokingly easy, took weeks to get graded, then the exam was much harder than assignments. He took down the message boards after I politely mentioned having better assignments to prepare for exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2008<br>Class Name: CSC451<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible instructor.  Cannot speak the language very well.  Very difficult to understand. Although he tells you what is going to be on the test, the questions are incomprehensible. He does not grade homework promptly. It is easily distracted and side tracked.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2008<br>Class Name: CSC451<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely disorganized.  Although assignments build upon one another he does not grade assignments promptly.  Do not explain what you did wrong on assignments.  Assignment grade is a mystery; do not ask it will not be explained.  Really poor grasp of the English language.  Take the class from someone else.</div></div></div></body></html>
