Her quirks and random side comments do make for a good laugh though. She is a really weird grader though (I read the first book cover to cover, and got a C+ on my first exam, then didn't even open the second two books and got A's).  Anyways, as long as you go to class and take REALLY good notes you'll be fine!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Favors the jocks. Let's them talk nonstop while she's lecturing. If you have an opinion that differs from her, don't share it! She'll make you feel stupid and grade your work harder. If you aren't a jock STAY AWAY! Also dresses like a skank for such an old lady. That was distracting as well. Easy 'B' but boring and a horrible person.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2008<br>Class Name: SOC212<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall I think the class is tough and requires a lot of reading time, but the topics are really interesting. Her lectures are somewhat helpful but could be clearer. She assigns 3 novles to read in the course, and gives 2 tests along with a take home final. I would reccomend it but be prepared to read A LOT.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes pretty nice.

She canceld our final, well made it optional and let people turn in assignments and major projects a week late and we still got A's. I learned a lot and the tests were easy,,,straight from her notes.

Not clear at all about what she wants from students.  If you take her, make sure you study EVERY minute detail in the readings or else you won't do well on the tests.  Also, make sure you quote the book on assignments, even if she didn't ask for it and you don't think it makes sense to do so - I found out too late that's what she wants.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2006<br>Class Name: GENDER<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was a very nice lady, but grading was HARSH.

Thought she was an OK grader, but could have been a little more fair on grading the essays in general.  She knew the material, but definately showed her bias on a lot of issues.  Good class in general.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2005<br>Class Name: GENDERSOCIETY<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would recommend that you avoid this teacher at all costs. She was completely unhelpful and does not like it if you ask her any questions. I was very interested in the material when I started this class but this lady killed it. I found her class to be a waste of time even though I earned an &quot;A&quot; and it seems like she does not like men very much.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2005<br>Class Name: SOC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class.  Have taken Professor Harold a few times because I really enjoy her.  She is a really fair grader but expects a lot of critical thinking.

When I signed up for class, I wasn't interested in the topic. It ended up being my favorite. Class discussions are interesting. There is some reading, but you can skip around. The 2 M/C tests are kinda hard, but the papers are pretty easy. She can make a conversation about anything interesting.
