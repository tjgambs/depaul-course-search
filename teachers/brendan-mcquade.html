If you skim the readings, you get a good enough grade and he doesn't give out pop quizzes or quizzes, just papers on papers and maybe 2-3 assignments. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2015<br>Class Name: INT202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>It was a hard class but he's a great teacher.

He gave me several chances to do my work but I just didn't do it. The lectures were great. He's very nice and understanding. I just couldn't write the essays. All the people complaining about him just don't want to do their work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2015<br>Class Name: INT365<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor McQuade really knows his stuff. We covered a lot of material and it all was interesting. Some of the reading was dense but the lectures help you through it. A class on terrorism can be controversial but he handled it well. He was too fair. It would have been nice if he had told a few students just to shut up when they would derail things.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2015<br>Class Name: INT202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor McQuade is great. INT core courses are not supposed to be easy but, if you work hard for him, he'll work hard for you. He's also young and cute, which is a plus.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2015<br>Class Name: INT150<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Two 2000-word essays, a group presentation (lasts the whole class) and a discussion every Thursday. For my paper final, I asked him if I could get some feedback and he laughed and said: "Mmm, honestly, I'd rather not do that. But you can make an appointment with the writing center." </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2015<br>Class Name: INT150<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok, let's be honest. Brendan is a smart guy and he is young. But he is not a great teacher! Lectures are long and confusing. Attendance is mandatory. So If you enjoy the subject, and are willing to talk a lot and read A LOT, then take him. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2015<br>Class Name: INT150<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take him. Brendan is as boring as it gets. Lectures are long and there's always a discussion. If you don't want to participate, he will make you talk. Ugh, this guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2015<br>Class Name: INT150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I LOVED Mr. McQuade's class. I wasn't super into the subject but he still knew how to make it really interesting. You had to read a lot every week and he offered a wide variety of  topics for the 2000 word midterm and final.I felt bad because our class was bad but that does not mean he's a bad teacher at all. I would definitely take him again.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2014<br>Class Name: INT150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>He seems like a really genuine guy.  He is super smart and has a lot of knowledge to share. He is super down to earth, very chill.  He gives really good lectures and is a very effective teacher. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2014<br>Class Name: INT150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>His class is easy if you don't mind reading. He's a super fair grader and very nice. I would take another of his classes. He really tries to treat the students like peers and gives a lot of respect, plus is super understanding. </div></div></div></body></html>
