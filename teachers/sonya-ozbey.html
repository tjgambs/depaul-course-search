She'll make you challenge your beliefs, but won't try to force ideas on you. She REALLY likes class discussions, so if you speak in class occasionally, you'll be golden.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2014<br>Class Name: PHL287<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Sonya seems intimidating at first, but she truly loves what she teaches and makes somewhat dull topics come to life and make sense. She'll often use quick video clips from TV shows to make her points clear. There aren't many assignments in this class just three papers which are 4, 5, and 6 pages long. She likes participation, but it's not mandatory</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2012<br>Class Name: PHL289<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely loved Professor Ozbey. She and this class are the reasons why I've decided to pursue a major in philosophy even though i dreaded this class coming in. She's a fair grader, but is EXTREMELY understanding and does everything in her power to make sure you do well. She's my favorite professor so far. She's Turkish so she has a cute accent!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2012<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's very easygoing and respects students. It's hard to notice but she can actually be really funny at times. I'd definitely take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2012<br>Class Name: PHL287<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the amount of work required for the course was very reasonable (the final paper was supposed to be 6 pages long). She's also a fair grader, but gives very thorough comments. She's helpful as long as you try.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2011<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At first, I was reluctant to take this class, but at the end, I was glad that I took this class with Sonya.
