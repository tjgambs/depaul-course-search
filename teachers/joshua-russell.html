Write one page paper about it, he encourages you quote his slides which makes it even easy to do the paper. Super easy, you get to watch some of the best movies ever and he's an easy grader. 10/10 </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2015<br>Class Name: DC222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Each week you learn a new theory and apply the theory to the movie you watch. What's not to like? If you make an attempt you will do just fine. Mr. Russell is very laid back and you don't have to show up for class and can just watch the movie online as well as the lecture. Posts the theories on D2L as well.   Great class and great professor. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2015<br>Class Name: DC205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I was in a non-major class but I felt it didn't make a difference to him, which was great. We had the option to do 3 short film assignments or papers and had a final paper. His lectures were always so interesting and his film analysis were great and really made you think. Great professor, you can tell he loves what he does.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2015<br>Class Name: 30234<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing teacher. Makes the lectures fun and easy to follow. He's really funny and cares about his students. He tries to help you do better. I was in his screenwriting class and i would take it over and over again if i could. Amazing teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2015<br>Class Name: DC222<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>you watch movies and write a paper. you dont have to show up unless you want to sit in a theater style classroom. take this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2015<br>Class Name: DC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Josh is top notch. His style helped me break out of my shell and actively pursue writing screenplays more seriously. At the end of the day no professor can teach you everything you need to know about a given subject. Their job is to inspire your curiosity, which jumpstarts your leaning. Josh is that and more. Show up, be friendly, ask questions. #1</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2015<br>Class Name: DC222<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A successful professor in the industry.  Has a good sense of humor and will help you if you ask for it.  Shows a good variety of movies in terms of length, genre, and even country of production.  Lectures occasionally slacked, but not a bad course.  Pretty easy if you actually make an attempt.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2014<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Even though I took the course online, he was so helpful when writing my script. He's down to earth, fun, and cares about his students. If you take the class online, watch the lectures all the way through. I hope I can take another one of his classes! Awesome teacher! I highly recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2013<br>Class Name: DC323<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher. Second time taking him. Clear,concise, funny. Very knowledgable. 3 question quiz per week on short reading, simple. You work on development prePro, Pro, and Post, 4 a presentation of a short film all quarter, then pitch it to him on the last day, as if he were a potential investor. Do the work, and you'll learn a valuable skill!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2013<br>Class Name: DC323<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably one of the best instructors I've seen at DePaul.  Assigned a TON of reading and gave weekly tests.  Still, he's funny and REALLY knows his stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2012<br>Class Name: DC371<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Russell is a terrific professor with great insight from his experience as a working professional. He demands quality work, but if you're serious about becoming a filmmaker he will keep you in line and offer you guidance especially for directors/producers. Good man, funny guy, and great communicator.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2010<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>THE BEST professor.

He will help you to develop into the best writer you can be. He taught me a lot. Plus he is just a great guy. He is very funny and entertaining.

Josh is a filmmaker, therefore what he teaches comes from experience. He's energetic, inspirational, and extremely passionate about his work. He is also the most accessible instructor I've ever had. In his class, you never look at the clock, you just become engrossed in the newest lesson in film</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2009<br>Class Name: DC111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Real world experience.  Very smart in the subject of screenwriting.  Fun guy, funny, one of the best classes I have taken.  Kind of slowed down at the end, but very great professor.  I can't see anyone disliking him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2008<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher and person...Josh has developed his own method of formatting a screenplay and rather than following some lame cirriculum he teaches from experience as he has written and directed a festival bound feature called FANCYPANTS. He loves what does is super easy to talk to and helpful when it comes to the final screenplay. DC 201 AND 205!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2008<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed this class so much that I had to state my opinion...Take it! Professor Russel is a great creative writer who knows what it takes to be a successful screenwriter and his charisma is so intense that you would never get bored. Plus, watching movies in class is called research and I guarantee you'll never see a movie from the same perspective</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2008<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Funny, awesome, great teacher overall. Very helpful out of class. Very easy and fun class, but you are expected to write a 15+ page screenplay. Yes midterm, no final.</div></div></div></body></html>
