The biggest problem is that he is a Medievalist focusing on England and France. The first 3 classes out of ten are medieval history and he only glosses over the Renaissance.

I have never read soooo much in my life! there is a quiz ever week...on ALLLL the readings..if u honestly have a good 2-3 hrs just to dedicate to reading all the material and memorizing and understanding..take this course, other wise STAY AWAY!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2006<br>Class Name: HIS210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teacher extemely nice and helpful. Hard class!!! Quizzes each week over assigned readings. Way too much to read and remember-hardest part of class. Lectures interesting but don't try to write everything down. Be specific in notes. The last exam is comprehensive but gives you the whole exam and can bring in notes. This is most important = 50% grade</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2006<br>Class Name: HISTORY210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great teacher, very helpful and open to talk about improving in class. gives weekly tests on reading materials. no midterm just a big final...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: MEDIEVALPPL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2006<br>Class Name: MEDIEVALPEOPLE<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cool teacher but weekly tests that are very hard.

The reading is heavy and the quizzes can be a drag, but I thought that Prof. Miller was very interesting and fun. It would help if he took his time in the lectures a bit more. However, the subject matter is interesting and the papers, presentations, and final are not that hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2005<br>Class Name: HISTORY<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lectures are all over the place, but a very helpful teacher in general.
