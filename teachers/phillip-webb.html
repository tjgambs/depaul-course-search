Really cared about students. When lots of people did badly on the midterm, gave us the chance to write an exta paper. Class alternated--one day lecture, next day discussion. So we got to hear from him and also talk.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2010<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Prof. Webb for my LSP112 and I barely went but still got a B.

He likes to flaunt his large vocabulary and his knowledge at times. He's an easy grader but the class is really boring. It's nothing but a lecture every class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2009<br>Class Name: AMS150<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>super duper</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2009<br>Class Name: AMS150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was a fun, light-hearted class. Dr. Webb helped us discuss controversial subjects in American history. He made it fun.

The class was obscenely boring because we literally did the same thing every single class.  There were no variations.  He seems like he is clear on what he wants in terms of papers, etc. but then when asking questions like what to fix or correct, he is absolutely no use. Also really slow at replying to emails.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2009<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do the reading, write the papers, participate, you will do just fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2009<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BORING!!!!! I would never recommend this class. Talks on an on, and you can't even stay awake not mentioning listening to what he talks about.Seems to be easy going, like he doesn't care about anything and then he gets to the grading..that's the time when he wants to be a real professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2009<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He really got excited about the material and so made class interesting.
