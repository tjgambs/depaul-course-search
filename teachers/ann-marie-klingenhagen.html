She makes the material easy to understand and is actually useful to your life. I liked her sarcastic personality but I do agree that she comes off snippy. 1 midterm, 1 final and some myfinancelab quizzes. Participation is huge. Perfect attendance gets you a C. Make sure you talk in class & she knows you</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2014<br>Class Name: FIIN313<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HARD CLASS. She does not teach. Be ready to each yourself. She hands you a case study & says come back next week with it done.  She picks out your groups.  6 case  studies. She gives out an extra case study for extra credit, optional.  No midterm.  Final 20%  Participation 20% Case Studies 40% Presentation 20%.  She grades like a grad class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/14/2014<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class itself was straight forward and expectations are clear. Do the work and you will be fine. HOWEVER- I would NEVER take her again because her personality was AWFUL. If you ask questions that she thinks are "stupid" she will let you know. In my class no one ever asked questions because once you did she would make you feel like a moron. Just rude</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2013<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. Very clear in class and on what she expects. Class was fairly easy. Midterm, Final, and attendance.  Offers 3% extra credit. Midterm and final were not difficult if you attend class and pay attention. Recommend taking her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2013<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor. Professor K is extremely helpful, exams come straight out of the material covered in the textbook. Lots of real world experience to draw from. She is hilariously funny, and is slightly sarcastic. Do the homework and study, and you'll be fine. She really knows how to make concepts VERY clear. Take her by all means if you can!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2013<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She comes off a bit scary at first and at times is a bit snappy. She is a really good teacher though. She has a lot of industry experience to draw from and is very clear when teaching concepts. She offers extra credit and everything is pretty straight forward.

She comes off as kind of a drill sergeant in the beginning of the course, but warms up quickly.  Just do all the homework she gives both from the book and MFL and you can't fail.  I got an A pretty easily.  Tests are EXACTLY like the homework, so practice the home work! Lots of easy extra credit as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2013<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a really great professor that is very knowledgeable about Finance. It is a challenging class, but if you do the homework and MFL quizzes you'll be fine. If you study for the midterm and final you'll be fine. She also gives a lot of extra credit!!! Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2013<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very knowledgeable and passionate about finance.

Attendance is mandatory and if she doesn't like you it will be very clear in your grade. Our class was behind so we didnt have time, but BE CAREFUL because she said the winter quarter will for sure have to do the GROUP PROJECT! got lucky this time AVOID HER</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2012<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Straight forward, lots of extra credit. DePaul edition book. She can be condescending when you ask questions but she is still a great prof. Be sure to study for the Midterm and Final, they can be rough if you are not prepared.

The online assignments are easy and will boost up your grade. She will provide the review sheet, and whatever is labeled concept, make sure to read in the book.

If you ask a question, she picks on you. Mid-term and Final were tricky. I suggest you take Tom Berry or Karen Ahmed if you want an easy A.

She is such a ****. She acts like she's being so inconvenienced when you ask her a question. She makes you feel like a complete idiot no matter how legit your question is.

She is soo over rated. YOu need to bust your butt to get an A, and her grading is horrible. The way she grades on the midterm and on the current issues project is horrible.

If you show up to class all the time, follow the notes, you should pass this class easily.  Only downside is that she takes the whole class time and teaches after exams.
