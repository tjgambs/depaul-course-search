Extremely busy, and she still manages  to set aside time for students. She expects her students to come to class prepared. Those that do not put forth hard work, effort, and dedication might find her style difficult. I took her over the summer, and enjoyed the new knowledge I have acquired as a result. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2015<br>Class Name: FIN202311<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful professor, she caters to her students more than any professor at this school. Her exams are solely based off of the problems she goes over three times so her students understand it fluently. TRUTH: it is fast paced, students will freak out alot. BUT she spends all the time out of her busy schedule to make sure you excel in the INDUSTRY</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2015<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Took her for FIN 202. Not a tough grader for the most part but she is not clear whatsoever. Beyond her accent, she gives very unclear instructions for homework assignments and for the final project. Final project was a nightmare because of this and also the fact that she takes days to respond to emails. Basically, good luck if you take this course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2015<br>Class Name: FINANCE310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her for FIN 310 and I really enjoyed her as a professor. She is really funny and really nice and keeps you very engaged through her humor. She knows what she is talking about and the only kids that do not like her are the ones that come late or dont show up. Would take her again and I have learned quite a lot from her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2015<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think that she is new to teaching this course, so yeah she is somewhat disorganized and unclear at times.  With that being said, the material being taught is not rocket science.  If you need additional help, she makes herself available.  She is not really rude, as the commenter below said, but more so sassy.  Few hws, midterm, and final project.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2015<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Fuzesi was very unclear throughout the entire course and often skipped over a lot of material which was then needed for the midterm and final project. She goes really fast over the material and half the time student's do not understand what was going on. She is rude to the students and often calls them stupid as well. DO NOT TAKE!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2015<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have never had such a bad experience with a professor before. Fuzesi has no method of teaching. Her midterm made absolutely no sense. Impossible to study the book problems because her problems aren't remotely the same. AVOID TAKING HER.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/21/2014<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Barbara was a GREAT professor I don't know what people are talking about.  I took her in the summer of 2014 and she was super clear and super easy.  She told which questions I had wrong on the exams and let me retry them until I got them right.  As long as you come to class and show that you care, she will do her best to help you out</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2014<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Made the class very simple. Midterm was very simple and clear cut. Final project took some time but as long as you went to class she helped you through it. Highly recommend</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/04/2014<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a funny teacher, but shes very disorganized. Her style of teaching is very awkward. She doesn't make anything clear and there are no guidelines or due dates her  syllabus is not clear. She relies heavily on calculator and makes lots of mistakes. She doesnt teach the equations, or material she just kinda goes over problems. Not a good teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/20/2014<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>FIN 310 is NOT great for the summer. Period.  TOO much hard info/too short a time.  She did review items that would be on exam. Online quizzes help prepare you for exams. You MUST study.  I studied for this like it was my job. Got an A.  But it was rough for most. If you're not a FIN major, OR need help understanding concepts maybe take another..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/15/2014<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would not take her again. The online quizzes were unlimited tries and not difficult. The in class tests were not bad but not the easiest. The formula sheet she gave with the test was useless. She called out names after exam one of who scored below an 80 in the opportunity to retake. I'd say avoid if you aren't a finance major.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2014<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a terrible professor. Barbara has no relevant examples that make sense in everyday life. Her catch phrases get very annoying. The quizzes have unlimited attempts so they're easy and the exams are challenging but also doable. The formula sheet she gives is useless so prepare beforehand.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2014<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not the kind of professor you'd want as a finance major.  Confusing lectures for those who aren't that quick.  Odd sense of humor that makes class sometimes quite awkward.  Online quizzes aren't very difficult.  Overall not the best finance class to take, wish I took someone better to stimulate and support my interests in this major.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2014<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you're a slow learner, don't take her. She does give out many worksheets and a midterm review. Intimidating when asking questions so if you don't like asking q's, then avoid taking her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2014<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She may be a little disorganized, but that's only because she just began teaching this class. The online quizzes were fairly easy (you can google some of the answers and use the powerpoints). The midterm wasn't too bad (she gives you a study guide that's VERY helpful). The project was extensive and time-consuming, but if you ask her, she'll help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2014<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, learn a lot from her. 2 easy articles, 3 exams which are easy if you PREPARE for them. NOT a class for SLACKERS.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2014<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: C+</div><div id="right"><div>Fuzesi is a great professor, the ones who complain about her class being difficult expect to be spoonfed. She "picks" on her students becasue she truly cares for her them understanding the subject while other professors just give up. Class consists of three tests, 2 articles( I got 100 on both) Matlab quizzes and extra credit opportunities.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2014<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>She can get a little unorganized at times. However she is willing to help you during her office hours. She was a good prof for FIN 310, not so great for FIN 202. She is fair when grading, and as long as you do the hw on time she'll give you full points.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2014<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Fuzesi is very rude.  She does not believe in helping students when they are struggling.  She rarely is willing to explain full concepts in class and leaves many questions by students unanswered.  She never responds to emails either.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2014<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. F. is extremely clear. Most people don't show up to her classes, which is why she gets frustrated when someone asks about a topic covered the third week of class the day before the final. She explains concepts and reviews them effectively. I do not sympathize with people who do not show up to class and expect to get everything handed to them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2014<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: C-</div><div id="right"><div>Try to avoid this professor, she's not very skilled at teaching at all and she's excessively rude. She WILL humiliate you and call you names in-front of the entire class. She ultimately frightened people to the point where attending class was counterproductive because people were afraid to ask questions. Avoid her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2014<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I wouldn't recommend taking this professor at all. She's unbelievably unorganized and unhelpful. She does not grade the homework assignments or let you know what your grade is until the end of the quarter. She does not reply to emails on time and when she does they are only one or two words. She is very unclear about what she expects from students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2014<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was ridiculously unorganized and unclear about what she expected of everyone on the final project. It was a nightmare. Her "walkthrough" of the final required you to go in a backwards order or else it wouldn't work. She yelled at you if you asked about it and wasn't around at the end of the semester at all for assistance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2013<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is full of knowledge about anything finance related and really wants her students to understand the concepts. She is very helpful but you really have to be a good note taker to effectively follow her in class. Two part midterm and a final. Online quizzes are due every Sunday</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2013<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor. Learned a lot. Handouts were easy to follow. Only complaint would be she is not the best with emailing. Also, the online homework is bothersome. None of the homework I did on that applied to coursework in the class. Other than that, learned a lot, and she helped me to solidify the fact I want to be a finance major</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/12/2013<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Prof Fuzesi for a summer session, and she's one of my favorite teachers at DePaul. Not only was she direct and insightful, but she kept students interested and maintained our focus and motivation throughout the course. I can't tell you another class where I learned so much. She had the ability to take dry material and make it interesting!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2013<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the kindest teacher ever. Very helpful. And I promised this - We Love You!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2013<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has an accent, so pay attention. Class is spent on word problems and some power points. At times she will just stop in the middle of teaching something and end it because she is wrong or does not know how to say what she wants to say. Go to class study the problems & review the slides. Tests are easy but long, so practice before to get A or B</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2013<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good Professor. 3 tests and myfinlab HW. Lectures are not very clear and somewhat dry, so expect self-study. BUT, she provides work-sheets and goes over the answers in-class, and the exams practically mirror these worksheets. If you pay attention and study the worksheets, I can't possibly see getting anything less than an A-. Would def take again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2012<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a wonderful professor. She knows exactly what she is doing and could not be more willing to help. However, this is college and if you need help you need to go seek it. There is a slight language barrier but nothing too hard to overcome. She is very knowledgeable. Just show up to class, pay attention, take notes and do your my finance lab hw</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2012<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She knows what she is doing and knows exactly what she means to teach, there is just a minor language barrier that you need to learn to be patient about. If you pay attention and do your work she will do everything in her power to make sure you succeed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2011<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Make sure you keep tabs on your grade in D2L because she seemed to have misplaced a few midterms and didn't enter one of my assignments into the grade book although it was graded. She teaches VERY quickly and constantly makes mistakes and relies on the class to correct them for her. Final (cumulative) was very difficult. Go to class. Pay attention.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2011<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a good teacher. Very unclear and makes numerous mistakes when going over problems. She cares about the class but just is not a good teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2011<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It was her 1st quarter teaching & we were her first class. She's not the best at explaining things, but got better as time went on.  Read the book outside of class & practice all the problems on the worksheets she gives out & take home quizzes. This class is difficult but she is very helpful.  Don't hesitate to ask questions when you need help.</div></div></div></body></html>
