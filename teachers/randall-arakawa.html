But, in order to do good in his MIS 140 class you NEED the book, & you have to be prepared to study for hours. His projects are fairly easy, but his tests are hard. A big portion of his tests are based on the book and the other portion on his lectures. Study both the lectures & book and you will be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2015<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Here is the thing about Arakawa, he's not a great teacher. People like him because he is funny, but the fact remains he is probably the most confusing teacher I have ever had. He can stand up front and talk for hours without a simple pause to take a question. There is a reason why every one here tags tests are hard. Because nobody knows what he is </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2015<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The midterm & final are tough. You NEED to read the book in order to understand anything that is going on. Not an easy class, and he makes it more difficult. Curves the midterm. If you seek help, more than willing to help. SUPER nice and sarcastic. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2015<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don;t recommend him. I did all the stuffs in class, but still get a C. There are two projects, excel and access. One group presentation, midterm, and final. I got an A- for most of the assignments. However, i didn't really did good on Midterm. So if you are not a test taker, DO NOT TAKE HIM!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2015<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Funny guy makes hard materials relative to students especially those who aren't interesting in the material. PARTICIPATE! Overall easy class as long as you study the power points and pay attention in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2015<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Such an amazing teacher. He loves to be in class and keep you engaged. He is very helpful and makes himself very available for help. His MIS 140 class isn't easy but I got a great grade with effort and help from him. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2014<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Arakawa clearly lists what is expected of you in the class. I did not think it was impossible. I hate technology and learning about it but he kept his lectures fun so it is not too difficult to concentrate. Tests are not hard- of course you have to study. Great guy- would take again. Also very funny. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2014<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a funny guy, but not he best professor. For a 100 level class, I was shocked to see how difficult it is. Access is a pain in the butt to learn, but he goes through cool shortcuts with excel and powerpoint. Make sure to participate, because he writes down who did or didn't. Lectures don't help with tests. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2014<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He took months to post the final grade. I still don't know how I did on my final. Don't even bother emailing him because he will literally say it's against the law. You have to get the book to do well on his test. My friends in other MIS 140 classes did nothing and got A's. I worked hard in this class and still didn't get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2014<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Arakawa is the best! He is very funny, and is interested in his students success. I took him for MIS 140 and ICS 392 and got an A! There really is nothing bad to say about him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2014<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You HAVE to get the book. His tests have nothing to do with what he teaches in class. Not the most exciting class anyway.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2014<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Arakawa is a great professor. He is incredibly well versed in the subjects he is teaching and applies real world scenarios to all the concepts being taught. The mid term and final are hard, buy the book if you want to do well on the exams which ARE curved. Overall easy course to get an A if you do the work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2014<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just a ridiculous grader for a required senior class. He is a complete hardo when it comes to presentation grading and the papers. Doesn't give As. Not to mention his rubric for his cases doesn't match the content of the reading. Also, he curves the final and likes to feel good about it, cool it's impossible. Needs a reality check.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2013<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed this class a lot, and Mr. Arakawa was a great professor. The subject does take a little studying if you want to do well on the midterm and final. Other assignments included a presentation and some article summaries. He makes the class enjoyable with his humor and his presentations. Good class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2013<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is ok, not too hard. He wants you to do ok although presentation grading is pretty harsh. What really sucks about him that he does not post grades on D2l. In addition to that, more than a week after finals he still hasn't posted grades. How long does it take to grade scan-tron? really?</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2013<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Arakawa is helpful, funny, extremely intelligent and enjoys his time teaching. The class is definitely doable, but you need to put forth good effort because it is difficult material, but he is more than willing to help you. I know nothing about coding/html/MIS and I managed to learn a lot and became very interested in the topics discussed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/06/2012<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took him for summer session. His class is very informative, he is a very intelligent guy, can also be very funny. He does take the class seriously and you do have to study hard. I recommend him because I learned a lot. There is a group presentation that goes along with a project worth about 35% of grade. Take him if you want to learn & have fun.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2012<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fairly easy class. Mid term and final are 25%. Article summaries are 10%. Two computer project worth 5%. Make sure take good member for group project. I didn't do a lot and end up with A-.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2011<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cool guy that will help you as much as needed. Coding is easy to learn if you really try to learn. All the days that you learn about the web from his powerpoint slides aren't tested until the final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2011<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The guy is just a rockstar.  Grades on a curve if the class isn't up to par.  He stays after to help his students and is very thorough in labs.  Take him, and you won't regret it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2011<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great teacher, and I am looking forward to taking another one of his classes.  He is very clear and some might say a little corny, but I thought was funny and really keep me interested in his lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2011<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely one of the top two professors I have had the pleasure of learning from. Always helpful and is willing to listen. No boring time in class. Read the book and brush up on your presentation skills. I loved this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2011<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took him for ICS392 and MIS340.  he is a great guy and will make almost and adjustment to help his students. He does NOT have an accent. 392 is a lot of work, but nothing is that hard.  If you have no prior experience with HTML you will have to work a little harder tho.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/01/2011<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>extremely hard... take nina diamond shes easy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2010<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teacher is awesome but the subject matter is just really boring. I really didn't do much and ended up with a B. If you put a day of studying for the midterm (just study slides and notes) you'll get an A. He gives a very generous curve (went from 60-75 on midterm) Take him for sure</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2010<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take this class if you have it as an option. The teacher makes the class fun and interesting you have to study for the midterm and the final but they are graded on a curve. also, there is a big group project that is time consuming.overall really liked the teacher and the class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2010<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TAKE HIM! He is a great professor!! I did not buy the book and received a B in the class. The group project is time consuming and be sure to pick responsible people.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2010<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Prof.  He was very helpful and always willing to help you solve class projects.

Midterm and final require you to study, go over your notes AND read the chapters (not reading the chapters will come back to haunt you..).  Also, spend a lot of time on the group project and pick &quot;good&quot; reliable team members--this is not the kind of project done overnight.  I got an &quot;A&quot;.  Exams usually are curved.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2009<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor and a wonderful person, very helpful and understanding. The class is easy, but you may find it a bit boring though. The teacher does try to spice it up, but the material itself does not allow it. Pay attention in class and use the book to study for the tests. He curves the grades at the end and will always give you the higher grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2009<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Arakawa is pretty good, only thing though about this class it's almost the exact same as MIS340, just with some HTML. Midterm exam is building a website, 50 question multiple choice final, 2 group presentations. Overall not bad. Good choice to take him if you're looking for a ICS392.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2009<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Arakawa is among the most caring teachers at DePaul...super smart, too. If you want to learn about website design and how websites are used in the biz world--this is a great class. Mr. Arakawa is very helpful if need aid outside of class. Note: this class involves considerable work...prepare for weekly asgts...don't take with 4 other classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2009<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class will not be a lot of work if you have a tech background.  I think most people get caught up on the HTML and it takes a lot of time.  If you have previous web knowledge (even if it is just a little) it is not a difficult class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2009<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class required a lot of work that seemed to be a waste of time. He made us do group projects that required powerpoints and also a word documents to go along. His tests were pretty hard though, but he did curve them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2009<br>Class Name: MIS376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok what you need do know about this teacher: do the article summaries, very easy points...midterm a little difficult but gives you a pretty good curve got a 43 out of 50 ended up with being 43 out of 45...presentations get a good group and take the word document part seriously and you will get an A...tests are mostly on pp's, but some stuff on book</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/30/2008<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great teacher, an amazing person and one of those people you will remember for life!

Arakawa means well but he is so incredibly picky about everything that if you don't do things his way, he will punish you for it.  (Our group lost points on our report because are page numbers were at the top of the page instead of the bottom)  If you have to take him, then do it, but try your best to find someone else...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2008<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Arakawa is a pretty laid back guy w/ funny stories.  Liked the prof a lot but the material sucked.  8 Article summaries due throughout the qtr (easy points).  Att/part is part of grade.

Final was simple, as was the project.  I got a 50% on the midterm, talked once in class, missed 2 classes, and got a B.  Its that stupid midterm that gets ya.

He is pretty funny also.  He is always willing to help out and is always available.  Just be prepared to stay the whole time during class.  If you do everything he asks you to, you'll do fine.  Midterm was tough, but final was easy.  Project was a little tedious, but easy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2005<br>Class Name: ICS392HTML<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok this class wasnt easy for me because i had no experience with HMTL but Arakawa doenst make it that difficult.
