Yeah, it's good to &quot;think outside the box&quot;, but if your views don't mesh w/his, BE CAREFUL! Only one class had online quizzes (sucked) & VERY hard grader.  Avoid his classes unless you enjoy endless stress.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2009<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! Over a year later Dr. Lawson's teaching philosophy still stays with me. You get out of this class what you are willing to put into it.  Prior to enrolling into his class, evaluate why you are in graduate school. If you do not want to be challenged, forced to think outside of the box, or evaluate your own opinions, stay at home.

Views and curriculum presented are one-sided. Be careful of stating your views especially if they are conservative, you will be penalized.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/25/2008<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I felt that the text chosen for the class was way to one sided and opinionated to base a whole class around.  Also the paper topics were so vague and we didn't real find out what he was looking for until our papers were turned in and graded.  I felt that this was very penalizing, due to the fact that the text was very complicated and confusing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/13/2008<br>Class Name: SCG410<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably the least helpful professor at DePaul.  Seemed uninterested in teaching the class...uninterested in helping his students.  Answered questions with questions.  Avoid if possible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2006<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He challenges conventional philosophies, stereotypes and mature thinking ensues. You need to come to his classes with an open mind and be ready to learn. So many of us take a course just to check it off, his courses are there for you to improve your thinking about the world around you. He supports you in the class & beyond with help & coninue dialo</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2006<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought he had interesting points but if you question his grading he will make your life miserable throught the class and any other classes you take with him. Found that out the hard way. His teaching style is different but his fairness is not there. He picks and chooses who he likes in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/08/2006<br>Class Name: EDSOCMIDDLE<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very indifferent.  The greatest concern is that he does not clarrify how students are to use their peer evaluations, which permitts petty students for grading their peers unfairly-this counts for a huge part of your grade.Presentation scores seem to count more on popularity by one peers verses abilities-and he doenst seem to care...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2005<br>Class Name: 408439<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Phenomenal teaching, seems vague at first but he is really trying to leave the assignments open to YOUR interpretation which is good for you to apply learning to your own need and past experiences. I found this to be highly refreshing and I learned so much. Great professor would definately take again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: SCU<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy to succeed in this class. Show up and do the work.  Funny and engaging. Actually graded the final with us so that we could explain our answers and he could improve on the test. He even responded to one of his ratings on this cite, noting that we discussed the uselessness of the cite during class if students only express vegenence & frustration</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2005<br>Class Name: EDPSY<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't feel like I learned from his pedagogical style, his class is very easy and he is a very nice guy with good intentions, wouldn't really take him again though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/14/2005<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He expects a lot from his students, but you will learn a lot.

He challenges you in a good way!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2005<br>Class Name: RACERELATION<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Doc Lawson a few years ago and he was by far one of the most interesting people let alone teachers I have ever met. In a class about understanding all walks of life (being the only white male) was interesting but he made me learn from others eyes. He motivated students to embrace all cultures for their beautiful things. I would take him again</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/09/2005<br>Class Name: SCG439<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He has a lot of knowledge.  His courses are difficult, but he is very clear as to what one must do to succeed in his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2005<br>Class Name: SCG410<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My whole class struggled. Have had him for others, he was great there but here &#63;&#63;&#63;. The text was not a beginning text even though this was a beginning research class. He needs to have more lecture time and less class presentations. Quizzes were extremely hard, no A's some got F's. Made us buy a workbook we never used. Not reco. for SCG410.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2005<br>Class Name: SCG439<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lawson is great and you will learn a lot about development without even realizing it. He picked out great supplemental materials and the assignments weren't too bad and were completely relevant. Plus, he's an engaging person, which is always a bonus in the ed department. I'd take him again if I could.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2005<br>Class Name: SCU207<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher!

He was the first professor I took for my master's program. His class was not easy, but he was clear and concise. I loved him and wish I could take him again. Take him if you can. He has a really cute Jamaican accent too!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/30/2004<br>Class Name: EDU<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice teacher, laid back guy.  His grading isn't too bad, but quizzes and tests can be kind of hard.  He doesn't care about attendance, and seems to just care about the well being of his students.  Easy to listen to.
