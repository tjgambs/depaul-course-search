He plays with the wording a bit. First, he does not curve- at all- that doesnt bother me so take it as you will. Second, he gives no real idea of what will be on exams. Third, I was one of the students who scored high on the midterm. He will definitely test your knowledge of accounting. 3.8 GPA</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2013<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awful. 1 A- and 1 B was given. Everyone else got D's and F's on the midterm. He informed us that you must spend 25 hours in his class a week to get an A. Unless you are obsessed with accounting and are willing to put in that amount of time just for his class, you will drop and you will waste your money. He has been teaching for over 50 years...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2013<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Anyone who said he isn't hard definitely set the curve. In my class one person got an A and one person got a B out of 24 people. After midterms half my class dropped. If you set the curve in your classes, he's great for you. Besides that don't risk your Accounting career on a "challenge". Because you will stay mad and regretful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2012<br>Class Name: ACCY305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Cohen is one of the best teachers I've ever had.

ZERO students in a class of 30 got an A on his midterm. He spends hours going over material that he barely puts on his exam and then claims that everything on his exams are covered in class (yeah, right). Absolutely avoid him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2010<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do whatever you can to get into another instructor's section. He may be very knowledgeable, but that doesn't mean he knows how to get that info across to students. It's one thing to have to work harder and another to have to teach yourself and have to attend class. What exactly is his job&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2010<br>Class Name: ACCT305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>don't trust those yellow faced comments.

Avoid him if you can.  They shouldn't be letting him teach anymore. His objective is to weed out students, but it's not fair.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/05/2010<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cohen is by no means impossible. Sure, he doesn't baby you, but that's what your mom is for. All I did was pay attention in class, really focused on reading the book before tests, and went through the homework as practice (aka all things you should be doing anyways) and I got an A. He really knows his stuff and is always available for help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2010<br>Class Name: ACCT305<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor. Accounting is a difficult subject and requires a lot of work. You can't expect to take an accounting class and not do work. He forces you to understand everythig.This will benefit you when you take the CPA. He doesn't want to see kids fail. By making you work he gets rid of all the students that shouldn't be accounting majors.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2010<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ACCOUNTING MAJORS: Write to the board to add different teachers. This guy's sole purpose for waking up each morning is to fail you and make your life miserable. DO NOT TAKE.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2010<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Any other prof. is better than Cohen! I am a 4.0 student and this was my last quarter... he will tank your GPA and seems to enjoy failing students. Studying seemed useless with the degree of difficulty this guy places on students. Removes points if you DO NOT SHOW UR WORK ON MULTI CHOICE QUESTIONS, NO JOKE.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2010<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You must be willing to read the textbook and put in time towards the HW. He is a nice guy but, let's face it, he is not the most interesting person to listen to. Tests are not easy so studying is required and he doesn't explain the material very well. Take the class if you're willing to read the textbook and teach your self.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2010<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible teaching approach. very hard tests. make sure to read everything, includes concepts, categorizing transactions, and definitions. Like 28 out of 35 students got a C or lower and that was just the midterm.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2010<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Okay...this class made acc 305 seem impossible. It's a hard class and you have to study on your own! Unless you are a genius..be prepared to study study read and read etc...

He is boring, talks throught whole class, does little to engage you.  His tests are unnecessarily long, poorly worded, and gramatically incorrect. Proceed with caution.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2009<br>Class Name: ACCT305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a joke. You will have to teach yourself. He mumbles, makes weird snorts, comments on random things, and &quot;goes over the homework&quot; by putting up a slide, talking for a minute, then moving on to the next problem. He fails to recognize that while he's a pro in the subject, we're still learning the damn thing. Avoid him. Take ANYONE else.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2009<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are not the type of student who can teach yourself completely new material with little to no guidance, it would be in your best interest to pick another teacher. As previously said, lectures are Cohen talking in circles about concepts mixed in with random examples.  There are no visual aids, study guides, or technology of any kind.  AVOID.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2009<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do everything you can to avoid this man. His tests are hard, questions are purposefully confusing, and he's a tough grader. Your grade will be reduced for missing classes and his &quot;lecture&quot; is a joke. He simply stands in the front of the class and lectures to himself off the top of his head... No real direction whatsoever.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2009<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Clearly a smart dude but completely misses the point of him even being in a class full of people that are new to the topic. He just sort of reads and lectures to himself. To add to the frustration, he'll &quot;argue&quot; w/himself the INNUMERABLE merits of his teaching style. I think people confuse good intentions & difficulty with actual quality.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2009<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy, very &quot;old-school&quot; approach to teaching. He thinks computers are the devil and calculators are pointless. His exams are very difficult. You MUST come to class having read the material, otherwise class time is pointless. If you come with questions on what you don't understand, he will clarify, but don't look to learn it without reading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2009<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although I think that prof. cohen is a nice guy, the man should not be a teacher. He does not teach, he reads and I did not pay tons of money to go to this school to have a professor read to me. There are certain people that are not meant to teach and is #1 on that list!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2009<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Getting less than a B- in this class does not mean that you shouldn't be in the accounting profession, as someone said below, it just means that you can't teach yourself 5 hard accounting chapters. Because that is seriously what you will have to do-TEACH YOURSELF, because he sure won't. He's a very nice man though, but bad teaching style.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2009<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TERRIBLE!!!! Class average on the midterm was a 63%. He will doc -5 points off any question u answer and don't show work for, EVEN IF U CIRCLED THE CORRECT ANSWER. He stands and points at the book. Take Prof. Towers. She will teach in a real world style that will make you learn and ENJOY this class. This guy just brings everyones GPA down. RETIRE!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2009<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is by far the oldest teacher I've had at DePaul and he has some seriously goofy jokes. You will undoubtedly need to study your butt off for this class and he refuses to &quot;curve&quot; his exams (class avg for midterm 62%) However if you're looking to learn, take this class. If you're looking for an easy PASSING grade, turn the other way.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2008<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OK! I'm literally proud that I got an A in his class! BELIEVE ME!!! It is crazy!!! Only 5 chapters but quite difficult ones though; he was terrible at the beginning but got better as the course progressed (in terms of clarity, other than that he is a very nice person and a very knowledgeable person), expect to study hard, i mean it!!!

For one...hes ancient.  The style of teaching he uses is so old fashioned and unhelpful.  Hes not very clear and everything is done on paper.  So confusing.

Very confusing...but nice though!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2008<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really difficult professor but he will teach you more about hardcore accounting than any other professor will. You really have to try hard and not be named Karina Sanchez.  Ella esta muy loca. Anyone else should do well in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2008<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A C in this class is an A in most others, so please ignore the cocky comment below.

If you actually study and keep up with the material there is no reason to fail this class.  He simply realizes that everyone is at the junior/senior level and makes them work for their degree.

Not easy, but I learned tons and did get an A, though I spent an incredible amount of time studying.  He is very straight forward, no surprises.  Everything is straight from the textbook.

I'm a hard worker and have a good GPA, but if you are taking accounting for the first time, do not take Dr. Cohen.

Over half the class had to drop after the midterm- I don't know why  I didn't.  He is older than the hills and subsrcibes to some form of teaching that was popular with the pilgrims.

Take this class if you like to learn on your own. He gives horrible explinations and does not go over the material well. Midterm and Final are very hard.

It doesn't matter that he is old, he simply cannot teach. He didn't solve even one problem. He just go over the &quot;illustration problems&quot; from the book. That's it.
