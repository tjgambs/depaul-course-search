He encourages questions to make sure you get it. The work is hard but he's very straight forward in what you need to know for quizzes and tests. I had minimal math skills but did average in the class. I would definitely take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/21/2011<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kevin is the caliber of teacher you would expect at this level.  He is very knowledgeable and well organized.  The subject matter is deep and broad, but he balances this by letting you know exactly where to focus for quizzes and exams.  He moves fast but has no problem stopping to answer questions.  I give him high marks.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2011<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very tough material if you are not a math guy. Very smart guy, but only take him if you are a calc wiz or a quant finance guy. Very helpful, but very ambitious with what he tries to cover in class. We were doing stuff that belongs in high level econ / fin classes.</div></div></div></body></html>
