Class is taught entirely off power point.  She spends way too long on simple topics that everyone already understand.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2013<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Where do I begin with this lady? Class is powerpoint driven, and I don't doubt she knows the subject, but it becomes especially frustrating watching her fumble with the material she's teaching.  It's pretty obvious she lacks any engaging teaching skills conducive to student learning. Be prepared to learn all the material on your own. 1st B+ of A's.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2012<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm really happy I ended up in her class. Very good teacher. Lectures are boring and power-point driven, but still manage to be very effective in helping you learn the material. Homework is online, and there is not too much of it... always a plus. Overall- really nice woman, relatively decent class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2010<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super nice lady. I have struggled with finding good profs for Eco 105, and this one was finally doable. You have to actually read, come to class, and pay attention.  Not easy, but Eco 105 is hard stuff!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2009<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a nice lady but her class was horrible. Rarely talked about current events. Would only teach off of her slides and if anybody brought up current events she would barely sayanything.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2008<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class, boring lectures.  Print the power points off of blackboard and then just highlight or sleep during class.  I honestly could have skipped like every class, but she takes attendance.  Just make yourself go and facebook or something.  Online homeworks are pretty easy, the book is online too.  One group paper, a midterm, and a final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2008<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very bland class. Her midterm was about 100 mulitple choice questions. I barely finished it in the hour and a half of class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2008<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely boring class! I was actually highlighting what she was talking about in the book. Goes through power point presentations and almost never does any real problems... while the exams contain many problems. Lots of definitions with barely any applications!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2008<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you like professors that teach at a snail's pace and get themselves confused easily, take her class.  It should not take two and a half weeks to get through supply and demand in a graduate course.  If you want to learn, take someone else.  I don't think there is a worse professor at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/29/2008<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this class was the largest waste of my life yet. the professor just regurgitates information from the book. class was extremely boring. only good thing about this class is the lack of attendance policy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2008<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'd really recommend taking her class for two reasons: 1)no accent 2) tests are pretty easy. Just do the problems and practice problems and you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2008<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Goes through the material quickly.  Test are OK, but does give a formula sheet.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2007<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I actually took her b/c she had good ratings in here but i wish i NEVER did. Every thing is in powerpoint and she goes thru the material so fast just to get it done, doesnt care if we get it or not. And the online APLIA homework sucks. Takes up soo much of ur time. Everyone did horrible on the midterm! Don't recommend her at all!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2007<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SHE NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND that powerpoints are NOT FUN OR USEFUL! Don't even go to class because you can just print the posted powerpoints.  So useless i can't say it enough</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2007<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her lectures are very clear and you learn a lot if you pay attention.  She makes a difficult topic easy to understand because she actually teaches in her lectures instead of just p****ing through material.  I highly recommend her.  You do have to do a group project - I recommend the case studies instead of the industry analysis - case study is easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2007<br>Class Name: ECO305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is great! Little boring, but you DON'T HAVE TO BUY THE TEXT TEXT BOOK. She explains everything very clear. SHE'S A GOOD TEACHER and very sweet! I recommend her 100%!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2007<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Show up to class, read the book, pay attention.  She cares about the coursework and is willing to spend time answering any question to make sure you understand.  Tests are tough but fair.  Purchase the study guide and complete it before tests and you'll Ace them.  You can not rely on lecture notes alone. There are book questions on tests!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2006<br>Class Name: ECO319<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Oppenheimer is a great professor. The course is reading intensive, but the material does provide some interesting alternatives to neoclassical economic thought. Overall you get out of the class what you put in. I would take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Oppenheimer is severely underrated on this site. She was very clear and laid out what would be on each test on the syllabus. The homework she assigns is similar to the tests. I studied for about 2 hours max. for each test and walked out with an A. Take her. She's worth it because econ can be hard!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2006<br>Class Name: MICROECONOMICS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although I did good in class, I had to put a lot of time into reading and using the study guide. When I had questions, she would gladly answer them. The concept of economics can be quite challenging and u must focus in studying a lot if you want a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yes, she is boring, but also very sweet and willing to help anytime.I felt bad for her when people left class in the middle of her lecture. There are 3 tests, and grading on the curve.I suggest that you use online access that came with the book, and do the chapter tests.Real tests are very similar to what you see there</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2006<br>Class Name: MICROECONOMICS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very good professor. Sometimmes her lectures can get a little borring, but she always explains things clearly. The tests are difficult, but usually there is a curve. She is also available for help anytime! I would stop in her office and she would always be there. Take this class, you will learn a lot if you work hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BORING!

If you go to class and endure her powerpoint lectures, and then double check knowledge by reading the book and even the study guide, then you can easily get an A in her class. Good teacher overal though - explains things very well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2005<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I FAILED the first time got a B- the second time.Really she is very helpful and not hard to understand! Sometimes her power points go to fast but JUST READ and pay attention really not HARD. If econ scares you TAKE HER!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2005<br>Class Name: ECO319<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is boring, there isn't a whole lot of student interaction in class, and the assigments are somewhat monotonous. I did enjoy the reading and material, however the class does not provide a strong grounding in ECON as a whole. I would recommend taking a different course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2005<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty easy class, only three grades, no attendence. multiple choice tests, around 80-100 questions, so there is room for error.

Sit home on the couch and read the hell out of the slides/book/and study guide.  Do multiple choice on study guide.  you'll do fine.. dont go to class unless you have nothing better to do with your time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2005<br>Class Name: ECO319<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is boring.
