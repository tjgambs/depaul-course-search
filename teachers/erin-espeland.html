Very clear and succinct. Provides many real-world examples. Group projects and activities are pertinent and helpful. She is VERY helpful and will go out of her way to ensure your understanding.

I took it over December intersession, but it wasn't too bad.  The simulation is a great way to utilize knowledge from many other commerce classes in a practical way.  Great class, great professor.  Overall grade= &quot;A&quot; range.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2010<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It is so obvious when a professor comments on their own page.  Don't do that to falsely lure students into your class.  Instead focus on how you could improve the whole learning experience and your teaching methods.  DePaul really should make evaluations public so that students can get the true evaluation of the professors.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2010<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Superb professor. Makes her expectations from students clear. The quizzes and exams are tricky as is the simulation. Study hard and you could get a B easily. Slackers may want to find a different professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2010<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As an adult returning to school, I can say the class was a great learning experience. Tough, but definitely doable. The problem is that there isn't enough time to cover the material, so everything is crammed in the 3 hours we met each Mondy. If you study you will be A-OK.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2010<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a caring person, and likes to see her students succeed</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2010<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fun glass, I'd recommand.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2010<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked her.

Yes it is not your typical blow off ICS class, but you actually LEARN something. Pretty sure thats why we are all paying 2000$ a class right&#63; to learn and not to get an easy A&#63; Grow up</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2010<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting class but very difficult for a senior seminar!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2010<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>it was an ok class, but in no way an easy class. challenging but doable, if you are looking for a blowoff ICS class keep looking.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2010<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great teacher. Made the class fun. One thing I didn't like is you have to buy a $40 program for the class, but we hardly used the book at all. The class was fun and interesting. Very easy and an easy A if you put the time into the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2010<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best professor ive EVER had. There is nothing else to say. There is absolutley nothing negative any1 can say about her even if they try!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2010<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Love her. Will learn a lot. Not hard at all and you pretty much grade yourself with the final self-review essay. Very fun class and cool professor. Interested in the students learning and very helpful. Will probably change the book we used since most students didn't like it. Take home quizzes and final essay. Take her, I'd do it again if I could.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2010<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Teacher!  The simulation is the entire class time and then she lectures for a bit and then lets you out.  Easy ICS class.</div></div></div></body></html>
