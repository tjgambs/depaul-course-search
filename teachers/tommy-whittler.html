He is such an effective communicator that many of the concepts he taught still stays with me. Yes, his quizzes and exams are pretty difficult, meaning you need to know the concepts and know where and when to apply them. If you are a marketing major, I highly recommend you taking him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2015<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Senior reflecting on 2013 class.  sounds like many peeps are angry that Tommy doesn't use lectures to regurgitate things from the book. his lectures are interesting and his "Tangents"  give insight on his experiences as a consumer.  the tests are refreshing because it isn't just scantron. read the book and go to class, but don't overstudy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2014<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: F</div><div id="right"><div>I spent about 60 hours studying for this guys quiz, midterm, and final.  I study with quizlets, notes, and handout. Mr. Whittler "will" deceive you. A lot of his material is overlapping and unclear. He will grade you like he God and this is your only chance to survive. I didn't have a shot in the dark in passing this guys exams. I damned everyday!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2014<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want to take this Professor, you will get low chance to pass.

Not even learn anything from his class.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2014<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: C-</div><div id="right"><div>Take anyone but Professor Whittler. His tangents teach you nothing about consumer behavior, and that about sums up every class meeting. He rants about Harley Davidson Motorcycles, cars, his cat, and other things that have to do with him. Professor Behavior would be a more appropriate course name. He does not use D2L+dishes harsh grades @ course end</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2014<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If other professors are available, take them. I didn't learn anything useful in this class which is a shame considering I was really looking forward to the subject. Most of class time is spent listening to him brag about his motorcycles, cat, and home. He is a nice guy, but I would steer clear of taking him if you intend on learning anything. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2014<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>This is one of the smartest Professors that has ever taught me. For the final and the midterm he gives you an outline of what you need to know. If you don't do the outline or some of the reading you will not do well on the exam. Tommy is a genius so his exams are not the easiest, but if you study for them you will do fine. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/17/2014<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This has been my favorite class thus far at DePaul. He makes you really learn all of the information. I found a huge interest in the subject didn''t study didn''t read the book and got an A. Not sure what these people are talking about. Highly highly recommend him and this class.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2014<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>This class is NOT that bad.

Can only relate concepts to motorcycles, getting a deal in a purchase, and his cat.  Extremely difficult tests, you cannot get by with a tentative grasp of the subject, be sure to study hard if you want a decent grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2014<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You will never learn so much in one class as you do in his Consumer Behavior course, but getting an A is tough. Although attendance isn't mandatory, its hard to get an A without attending class. Go to class, take notes, do the readings, and make sure to study and you'll do fine but his exams are super tough.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2014<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One quiz, midterm, and final, but the exams are super hard.

If you're looking for knowledge then take him, you will learn a lot. He gives the best examples to help students comprehend material. His classes are hilarious :) If you're a marketing major I recommend you take him, you won't regret it (unless you just want an A)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2013<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's great! Nothing he does is traditional, which makes it interesting. He engages you into a lot of real life experience. Take a lot of notes with the outline he provided. Do the study guide and readings. His tests are hard, lots of short answers and cross word for the final. Do the extra credit! 2 tests, 1 quiz, 3 extra credit.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is very engaging and fun! His exams are a little tricky, used flashcards for the exams and was fine. Not an easy A class, tests your ability to be efficient with time and ability to listening. However the information I learned was applicable to every day life. Can't say that about many classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2013<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tough exams. He tries to make them "fun" but the questions just end up being really confusing. Grade is made up of a quiz, midterm, & the final.

Very funny in a quirky way -- loves to talk about his weird consumer tendencies and his love for basketball -- but also very knowledgeable about the subject.

Everything you need to do well on exams is through powerpoints & handouts; take notes & study them! These "nasty" reviews are deceiving. He is an awesome professor...the best & I'm a Finance major.

You learn a lot about psychology & how it applies to consumers behavior.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2012<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor. I learned a great deal in his class. Tests are tricky, but if you show up to class and ready the notes and readings, you should be able to get an A or B. Final is tougher than midterm.

I wasn't sure about taking him after reading the reviews here but im so happy i did!! the classes are interesting, the tests are NOT hard if you at least read over your notes.

He uses real life examples and clearly explains the materials. His handouts help ALOT! His tests are very difficult when you don't know the material, but he is very clear that you will know what the answers are. Tests are application based and not just definition.

His class is very entertaining. Tests come in a variety of forms such as a crossword puzzle, etc. He challenges you. Take good notes!
