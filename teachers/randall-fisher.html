Its just not necessary.

I've had better Finance professors, but I've also had worse.  You have to do all the online homework and quizzes or you'll never pass.  He also assigns problems from the back of the book, but never checks if you actually do it.  You should do those problems anyway, because you'll see them on the exams, sometimes verbatim.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2014<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Quite possibly the worst teacher I have ever had at DePaul!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2014<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have mixed feelings about him. He is a nice guy but awfully disorganized. I get the feeling that he comes to class with no idea of what he's got to teach. He just reads the slides to you and then tests you on every single MFL problem. It wouldn't be an issue had he told us so ahead of the exam. Basically, you'll be teaching yourself this quarter</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2014<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I chose to ignore the comments here and I am paying for this dearly. He is a likable buy but disorganized, and because he talks nonsense, he wastes time in class, which means we wind up teaching ourselves. Often we can only get to do the hw by having taught ourselves the material as we never get to cover all of it in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2014<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>STAY AWAY from this guy. Try to teach off powerpoints, which means he talks through problems instead of show you how to do them. Class is showing problem on slide, asking you to figure it out, the when the one kid in the room has the right answer he says, how'd you get that? Not actually teaching anything. Tests: HARD. He gives no partial credit.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2014<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would not recommend taking this professor for Fin330. If he had a more strategic teaching style, I would be more gracious with his score. His tests are under a time constraint and reward fast test-takers. If you're stuck taking him, don't take 5 classes that term because you will need the extra time to learn the material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2014<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy. 2 midterms, final, & HW. Each 1/4 grade. Got an A-. You need to READ THE BOOK & use all of the online resources which includes the HW. If you don't do both, you won't pass the exams. The exams are challenging, need to manage your time. If your an independent student I recommend this class. Reading the slide notes alone won't be enough.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2014<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It is a hard class and he makes it even worse.

He is a nice guy but you won't learn anything in his class. You will have to teach yourself everything and read the book thoroughly (not easy). He doesn't prepare you for the exams whatsoever. I absolutely regret taking his class. Choose a different professor for this class, trust me!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2014<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Necessary things to know BEFORE taking:  stats, CAPM, bond pricing.

I usually don't pay attention to these comments and go into the class open minded about the professor but I advise you not to pick him. Delay the class a quarter if you have the chance. Does not teach you much and expects you to know everything. Tests are extremely long and impossible to do well on.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2014<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!

Do not take him. I am really positive that you will regret it. There are two midterms and final. The exams are difficult but the given time makes it worse. He assumes that you know everything.

I got an A in 310 and even with a lot of study time its impossible to get an A in this class. 2 midterms and a final. The class is not bad but his tests are the hardest thing ever. Little time to finish and a lot of problems. It just feels like he covers too much materials.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2014<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER! He doesn't teach you anything, just assumes you should know everything prior to him even going over it, and when he does go over stuff in class he just flies through the material.

You will regret it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2014<br>Class Name: FIN340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Fisher is one of the best finance professors at DePaul. He really makes the material understandable conceptually.  Make sure you do the HW and go to class and you should be able to get, at the very least, a B.  Professor Fisher is also always willing and encourages to meet for extra help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2013<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Attndnce: You should go to class. Otherwise, you can't blame him for a low grade. Great professor. Invites every single person to come to office hours OVER AND OVER AGAIN. Don't believe the low ratings. I asked my older brother and he gave me the recommendation. Take if you want to get a job after college. Friendly and cool.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2013<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would advocate taking this course with another professor, if possible.  He was not able to answer difficult questions asked by the class and often stumbled over the material.  Personally, he is a nice enough guy, but I do feel that he has a lot  of room for improvement as a professor.  You'll just teach yourself with the book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2013<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy but awful class. Problem is that the hw assignments were almost always one chapter ahead of in-class lecture. Essentially, MBA students paid $3700 to teach themselves Corporate Finance (from a very reasonably priced $287 book) by completing the graded hw before actually learning the lesson/concepts from the professor. The final was brutal.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2013<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of people hate on this guy, but honestly I think he's a solid professor. I managed to get a 50% on the final, but still pulled away with a C+. First grade below a A- for Finance classes (DePaul Finance is kind of joke). Anyway that was my fault not his, I should have tried. Just put in SOME kind of effort and you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2013<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS GUY!! Basically Fisher expects his students to know everything while teaching as little as possible. He has had a lot of past experiences in the field of finance but it does not translate over to good teaching. You take two midterms and a final; about 40% of the class passed. Also, he's very arrogant and unhelpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2013<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Why all the bad commons? I took him for 2 classes, FIN 310 and Entrepreneurship,  and they turned out great.

He just had some guest speakers come in and talk. Quizzes are based on a textbook and most of our grade is from doing an investor presentation. All of which we have no lectures on. Again, he doesn't actually teach. He doesn't have a lesson plan nor is he prepared for class. Very unmotivated, lazy professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2012<br>Class Name: FIN398<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His New Venture Financing class is a joke. He does not teach you anything, I wonder why he even comes to class? The whole class is based on a business idea that you have and you have to pitch it to the class at the end. He plays no role in it and drags class while acting like he is teaching. To top it all off he makes coming to class required.

He did not have any midterms but he quized every week and 80% of his quizes were super challenging.

He expects us to work on his class 10 hours/week outside of class and believe me, it takes that much time. Not to mention, he is incredibly stupid. He doesn't understand the material any more than the rest of the class. Tests= very difficult. Over half of our class dropped.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2005<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would have been better off using the tuition money to heat my apartment last winter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2005<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was tough.  After having taken his final, and taken some time to relax and reflect, I think Fisher was a good professor.  He's tough but college is supposed to be difficult and people need to put some effort into things sometimes.  People that dropped just couldn't take the heat.  Everything in this class is hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2005<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2005<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is definitely not a blowoff class.  He's tough and material is tough. Hints: 1)Do all reading, 2)review hw&quizzes given by him and textbook (it helps) 3)attend all sessions 4)Go through each quiz & hw problem and get it right-counts as 30% and will help if u have trouble.  Not kidding w/10 hr min. for an A. HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE&#63;GOOD LUCK!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2005<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fisher is a good gardener and got rid of all those whiny weeds (you know who you are).  Tests are long & hard as is HW.  Take him if you are serious about finance and want to master it.  He will make or break you, but you should want that this early in a finance cirriculum.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2005<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2005<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Agree!

Your expected to teach yourself everything from the book. In addition, after each class you have a quiz of around 30 problems to do on blackboard.
