He really cares about his students. He is always willing to help and do his best to explain after class and during office hour. He is also a great academic and career advisor. I took two courses with him. He also gave me good recommendations which helped me get a good job and a successful career. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2015<br>Class Name: CSC402<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He made this class really approachable and fun to learn. Probably the first CS teacher I've had at DePaul who knows how to present material to beginners. We wrote a lot of programs which were beneficial to learning java, but don't be afraid to ask questions if you get stuck.  No midterm and our final was actually fun to work on. Take this teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2015<br>Class Name: CSC402<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If he wasn't a programmer, he could have pursued a career in stand-up comedy.

Reasonable man, a pretty good lecturer, great course structure, and completely awful at grading.  Half of the assignments were graded in the 24 hours before grades were due.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2014<br>Class Name: CSC402<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was an OK professor. Never answered my emails. He is flexible with late homework if you fall behind. The previous comment talking about the difficulty in HW assignments is spot on. HW 1-3 were very easy. HW 4-5 were far more time consuming. Final was a project that I received no feedback on. I do not know why I lost points</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2014<br>Class Name: CSC402<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy.  A little disorganized on assignments and a little slow on grading. Textbooks were not used much. Assignments started out pretty easy and got much harder very fast.  The difference in difficulty between assignment 1 and assignment 4 was enormous.  Pretty good teacher, will help you if you need it.  I would take one of his classes again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2014<br>Class Name: CSC402<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Rogers is very friendly and gives clear descriptions of things. He offers a good perspective as a working professional coder and focuses on advice that will improve coding skill and style. My only complaint is his disorganization in homework, they were sporadically assigned and sometimes too much hand-holding was involved.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2013<br>Class Name: IT232<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing professor. John Rogers and Chauncy Hollingsworth will go down as the best professors I've had at DePaul. Not easy persay, but if you actually go to class, and listen to what he teaches it feels easy! Very interesting and funny guy. Will take any class he teaches.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2013<br>Class Name: CSC241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Rogers has a very interesting approach to teaching. He has a sense of humor that most professors lack in the Computer Science field. I really enjoyed his class even though I did not do as well as I liked. Very helpful and insightful. Great person to talk to when confused on a concept.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2012<br>Class Name: CSC333<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very engaging professor. I gave high marks on helpfulness and clarity because, above all else, I felt he was invested in getting everyone to know as much about the subject as possible in the short span of the 10 week trimester.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2012<br>Class Name: CSC383<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good at teaching this sometimes difficult subject.

No mid-term only 1 take home Final project, if u pay attention in the class and take notes. really nice guy and old school as well. I hope he thought more classes at DePaul.

I took both cryptology and algorithms with him and his explanatory powers of the very mathematical and very abstract calm you down and make you realize that even you can understand these things. I am very math-challenged but even I got something out of his lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2011<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is super helpful. If you cannot understand anything or homework, he will spend as much time as you want off class to help you. Very very nice professor. He take attendance every class..Just come to class and take notes, you will be fine. some homework, midterm and final. He allows one paper cheating sheet.Very easy if you take notes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2011<br>Class Name: CSC383<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I cannot say enough good things about him. The subject matter was very difficult at times, but he has a relaxed, direct teaching style and explained everything very well. Easy grading, responsive outside of class time, and an open-book final. I learned quite a bit from him, and would recommend him for any class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2010<br>Class Name: IT231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WONDERFUL!

I would definitely take another class of his.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2010<br>Class Name: IT231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ONE OF THE BEST PROFESSORS AT DEPAUL!!!!

Really tries to be funny but he's not.  Springs the Midterm on you and no study guide.  Attendance is &quot;mandatory&quot; but never takes it so you don't really have to go every day.  Just a general waste of money...I could have used if for much better uses!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2005<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His sense of humor is what kept me awake in class.

He's way too easy.  I'd rather have a really hard prof, like Iyad Kanj, so I can learn alot.  I'll get an A and I feel like I learned a Ds amount worth.  Worst part: Won't grade your HW until end of sem.  But he's brilliant/helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/16/2005<br>Class Name: CSC491<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just an amazing person.  All around he is a fantastic teacher--giving open book exams.  Best teacher that I have had yet.  Plus he isnt your typical computer geek.

Certainly one of the best I've had at DePaul. His lectures are very clear and he did &quot;help sessions&quot; each week before the regular class to assist us with the homework. Homework load was reasonable and grading was fair. Generally quite available outside of class for assistance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2005<br>Class Name: CSC347<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very funny guy, I really enjoyed his class.
