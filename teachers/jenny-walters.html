Passionate about photography and art and taught us the difference between just taking pictures and making pictures.

High standards, did not give students the tools to meet them.  Frustrating and time-consuming class.  NOT recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2006<br>Class Name: BEGPHOTO<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>def seems like she does not want to be there. never once came into the darkroom during class time to help. expected perfect printing quality but never taught HOW TO DO IT. seems like she would be really cool, buut not so much.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2006<br>Class Name: INTRMDIATEPHOT<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not clear, unrealistic expectations, doesn't seem like she wants to be there</div></div></div></body></html>
