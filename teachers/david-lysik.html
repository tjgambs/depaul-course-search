Lectures are always interesting. I really think I learned more about religion in this quarter that I have in my whole like going to church. Be prepared to think theologically, not just spit back the same old religious fluff, as he calls it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2014<br>Class Name: CTH243REG233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is awesome. Midterm was take home, final was a bit harder than I thought. Weekly one page synthesis papers that aren't that bad. Good sense of humor. He sometimes rambles on but its always relevant. He makes religion very interesting and totally unbiased when teaching. I would recommend him over most professors!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2013<br>Class Name: CTH213<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly this was my favorite class this quarter. He is so freaking funny and just an enjoyable class. He goes on tangents but you wont mind at all. The midterm and final is hard though, he does not play around with that.

He was always so fun and happy everyday in class. He got the class laughing everyday! Around all of the laughs he did teach us some extremely valuable religious insights. He was able to get the historical message of the New Testament across to everyone in the class in a really fun and thought provoking way!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2013<br>Class Name: REL233<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty easy class and Lysik is very entertaining and never know what will happen next.

Some students found that to be threatening but I thought it was the most challenging class, getting me to think of things I never thought of before. And to have a logical, structured way of discussing things.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2013<br>Class Name: REL224<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Lysik is HILARIOUS. Assignments are due every class, but they only take 20-30min to do. The material can get to be a little dull and repetitive, but he makes it worth it. He pokes fun at students and makes everyone laugh. TAKE HIM HE'S THE BEST.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2012<br>Class Name: REL180<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Professor Lysik! The subject and lectures are kind of boring, but overall the class is easy with a small workload. Quizzes about once a week, but he gives the exact answers in his notes.

He really is hilarious and cool. The work is tough and if you wanna slack off this is not who you wanna take a class with. But as long as you do the work and honestly get it done with ahead of time its smooth sailing. He's NOT a hard teacher, little goofy with the grades but not a hard teacher at all.

However, you should know the answers to these quizzes because he bases them straight off the notes he writes on the board, which is very little. It's just that his lectures can be a little bit boring if you're not into the history of catholicism. 9/10!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/12/2010<br>Class Name: REL180<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For an intro course the quizzes, papers, and tests are extremely difficult.

Lysik is a very good professor. He makes clear guidelines for the course and follows them closely.

He definitely made the material less tedious especially for an 8:30 class. But he is a smart ass sometimes and he isn't really inviting for asking for help.

Overall a very easy course. He requires a series of short papers, but allows you to redo assignments and make up outstanding work. Participate alot, he grades much easier if you do.

A lot of fun, teaches the information well.  Lots of case briefs, but they're not hard and he grades them relatively easily.  A really nice guy--if he was our age, I'd totally hang out with him.

He knows the subject very well but is opinionated to the left.  However, he is receptive to good argument and is very fair.  Plenty of case briefs (look cases up at oyez.org or gov&#63; and justicia.org, com, or gov for clarity).  He leaves out some requisite info in his case files.  Do all the work, you'll do fine!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2006<br>Class Name: REL281<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's definitely NOT the worst at DePaul. I even think he's one of the best religion instructors I've had. His jokes are lame, but he knows A LOT about religion, and cares if you catch on to what hes saying.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: REL<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst Professor at DePaul.

But don't let that fool you and think that this is an easy class, because its not. The papers are very involved and the midterm and final are pretty challenging, and I went to catholic high school!
