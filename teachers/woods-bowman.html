He constantly confused himself in our class and was condescending to students who had questions.  I think most came out alright in the end, but his classes were the slowest, most drawn out classes I've ever had to sit through.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2007<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely knowledgeable professor and an easy A. Many students did not get A's, however, they did not take notes. He specifically states what to study for tests. For some reason, people are shocked when those topics are on the exam. If he looks at pg.50 in class you can bet it's on the test. don't be stupid, study what he tells you to study.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2006<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2006<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very knowledgeable man. He has a lot of very interesting things to say. He is very smart. I enjoyed listening to him. He is understanding but not a push over. He has personal political experiences. Take him if you want to learn about how Chicago politics really work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2006<br>Class Name: MPS515<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You will learn a lot in this class, and be prepared to read and comprehend the assignments.  He is very helpful if you get lost in all of the accounting-speak.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2006<br>Class Name: MPS515<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He didn't really explain the finance stuff.  Math itself is straightforward but he didn't talk about the equations and when to use or not use them.  He also made up spreadsheets with info that had little or nothing to do with the subject & discussed them in class.  Many of us were treading water during this part of the course.  Unclear explanations</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2006<br>Class Name: MPSFINANCEMGM<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This course includes some finance and accounting, which he teaches as if we've had taken introductory courses.  Most of us, including me, have not taken those courses at all or took them years ago.  I found his explanations for finance to be completely unclear and quite incomplete.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2005<br>Class Name: MPS<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>worst teacher ever.  it seems like he goes out of his way to give convoluted instructions to screw over the class.  most boring ever, as well.  if you have insomnia, this is the guy for you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2005<br>Class Name: FINANCIALADMIN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A really nice guy who really tries to work with you.

It was a class like any other with attendance, papers, a midquarter and a final, but while it wasnt an introduction, the professor graded liberally.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2004<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Bowman is a nice guy, who's very understanding. Most of the work for class is pretty easy, with the exception of perhaps the community project.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2004<br>Class Name: EXPLORE<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Takes his subject to seriously for an introductory course that is required by the university.  Too strenuous for a class simply meant to get us used to DePaul.</div></div></div></body></html>
