His lectures are long and easy to space out on, however they are interesting if you really want to pay attention. Read the book and study the normal amount a college student should and you will get an A. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2015<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: C</div><div id="right"><div>difficult tests </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2015<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: C</div><div id="right"><div>HARD EXAMS</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2015<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: C</div><div id="right"><div>hard long exams. very long readings for the exams. very difficult and unclear too. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2015<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AVOID HIM. The exam is like 10 chapters to read. there are 2 exams. they are very difficult and long. you have to do very very long reading for the exams which is very very very difficult for normal student to do. he is super boring. hard to understand his chinesse accent. I was fooled by the comments I read for him. AVOID HIM. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2015<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is pretty straight forward. Homework assignments are easy, and quizzes are not too difficult. The presentation takes some time to make, but he's a very fair grader. I found the book online, but I used to quite a bit for studying for the midterm, final, and the quizzes, as well as doing the homework assignments. Jack is awesome, must take!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2014<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring lectures. Do not take his class once a week for three hours. I suggest taking the one and a half hourtwice a week class instead. You only really need the book to define key terms on the study guide. Gives a lot of extra credit. Easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2011<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>test are harder than you think but just do the extra credit and youll be fine. group project is a joke.

Uses videos and guest speakers. Stay on top of readings and powerpoint presentations for the exams. Also pay attention to math related problems he does on the board bc they show up on exams.

He assigns 2 self-created hw assignments. He posts all his powerpoints online and uses youtube clips and guest speakers to try and keep interest. There is also 1 group assignment that isnt bad at all. overall, not that bad a class/professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2009<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is pretty easy and generally laid back.

You can't understand him that well but all the information on the powerpoints are basic, and also on BB. 4 extremly easy HW assigments. Don't need textbook.
