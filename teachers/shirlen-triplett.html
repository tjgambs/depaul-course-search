She deeply cares about all of her students and gives her all. Not only is she inspirational, she is a great leader and mentor that I inspire to be one day. Dr. Triplett is enthusiastic and clear while teaching her lessons. I learned so much from her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2013<br>Class Name: SCU237<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher there was a lot of material in the we had to cover but she made it work. You take quite a bit of notes from text and class but I would take a class from her again. In fact I would seek one out.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2007<br>Class Name: SCU339<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I like Triplette. She knows what she is talking about, she can tend to babble on for a while, but she is a good professor. Her exams are not hard, everything is gone over in class. She is knowledgable on the subject, I would take her again.</div></div></div></body></html>
