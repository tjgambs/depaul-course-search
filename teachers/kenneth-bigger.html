It's almost impossible to keep up with the reading and he is a tough grader. Bus. Eth. is a difficult class but he didn't do anything to make it accessible/easy to understand. Half the class got a D/F on the midterm (4pt curve) Unacceptable!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2005<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Has so much reading its almost impossible to keep up with. He is a nice guy, but a bit unfair when comes to tests. In our class half got Ds or Faild the first test and his curve was tiny. If you cant read 50-100 pages a night and retain all the information, dont take this class. His in class lectures are unstructured and very boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2005<br>Class Name: MGTREL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bigger is a bit unclear at times.  He tends to be at a lost for words when approached with a question.  Class not very structured.  A lot of reading (it's all on the exam). If u read u can Ace the class.  Papers aren't too bad either (3).</div></div></div></body></html>
