He even took the time to give me help and advice on work I was doing for my Internship. If you have any interest in the non-profit and government sector Prof Murray has an abundant wealth of knowledge that he is willing to share with his students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/30/2014<br>Class Name: UIP253<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Murray was able to bring a lot of energy and humor into his lecture which made the class more enjoyable. He also had a lot of in class activities which were very insightful and helped the class take a break from lecture. I also like the fact that he left reminders on upcoming assignments on D2L.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2014<br>Class Name: UIP253<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Murray is one of my fav top 5 professors at DPU. He cares about students and their growth. Even though his class is "easy" students are expected to take a deeper look within.  If you come to class you will put your self on a winning trajectory. In other words, I would take Prof. Murray's class again. Good Luck!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2013<br>Class Name: LEADERSHIP<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mark is a wonderful professor. He truly wants to help and make your time in his class worthwhile. He's friendly and funny making class fly by and the content is super interesting. I would recommend him over anyone else at DePaul. Ask about the work he does for the Field Foundation. He's just an all around great guy with a wonderful sense of humor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2013<br>Class Name: UIP253<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Murray is the best!

He taught a lot of great things to know - and I've used most of the skills learned in class in every day life, especially while job hunting at DePaul.  He is extremely helpful, as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2011<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mark is so awesome... I can't say enough great things about the man. Discover arts and culture was such a great class, and everything I learned felt so worthwhile, unlike a lot of other discover classes, in which the material was pointless. He is so interested in all of his students and is fun to talk to. Great guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2011<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Mark!

I was bored a lot of the time because of the busy work and lack of substance in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/08/2011<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy.

This class is amazing! Out of all the Discover  classes this one has to be the best! You meet important contacts and learn valuable lessons in this class.

He is very willing to help his students any way that he can. He would be a great reference to have in the future. However, he insists that you contribute, and it's worth saying something even if you don't know what you're talking about so you don't get points taken away. Overall though, great teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2008<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mark Murray is simply a great professor. He is a truly knowledgeable person, and I learned a great deal from him. However, what characterizes Mark is his incredible willingness to help. He is devoted to helping his students on anything and everything.

He really made my Discover Class an enjoyable one. I'm so glad I had him as a teacher. The Discover week really opened my eyes to new things, even as a native Chicagoan.

I would love to be his student mentor either next year or my junior year.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2007<br>Class Name: ISP150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great teacher...felt he definitely provided me with career tools that i was lacking.  all around great person, and highly recommend him and his class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2005<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor.

He'll say something to you and you wont know if he's joking or pissed off... you'll find 9 times out of 10 he's just being funny. Doesn't ask much, just that everyone puts effort into what he asks for. Great guy.

Some people cant distinguish if he is funny or if he is an ass, but his humor is never intended to hurt only to help. He wants you to put effort into the class and not just &quot;show up&quot;. Would make a good proffesional wrestler.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2004<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy and funny guy who mas the class seem short.    As long as you post on Blackboard, you will get all of the discussion points (20% of grade).  The papers are fairly easy.  The same goes for the portfolio.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2004<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2004<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy, i had a ton of fun attending class and would advocate to anyone taking their Junior Year Experiential to give Prof.Murray a try.</div></div></div></body></html>
