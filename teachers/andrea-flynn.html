Her class was extremely well-structured and the lectures were interesting and easy to take notes from. She takes her exam questions straight from the quizzes which she lets you keep and study from. If you have any common sense, this class is fun, interesting and not a difficult A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/17/2013<br>Class Name: PSY334<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lays on way too much work (TONS of reading) and expects you to know a lot for quizzes (there are 2 types-pop and scheduled!) and exams. Also has strict APA guidelines for papers that are inconsistent with official guidelines you find anywhere else. Definitely do not recommend as I didn't find her to be pleasant whatsoever.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2012<br>Class Name: PSY363<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVE Dr. Flynn. Class exams are tough, but just study the book and her powerpoint lectures and you will be fine.  She is so helpful so make use of it! Highly recommend this class because you will leave wanting to take her for another class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2012<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Flynn is awesome! She is very helpful when there is something that is difficult to understand. Make sure you do the readings a lot of exam questions come from them. Very willing to help if you are willing to put in the work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2012<br>Class Name: PSY363<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved her! Took the Alcoholism and Addiction class and never wanted to skip class because it was always interesting. One of the best professors at DePaul for sure.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2011<br>Class Name: PSY354<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There's a lot of work in this class. It's not hard, but just A LOT. There's 5 critical analysis papers, 4 online exams (lowest gets dropped), 5 hours of volunteer work, & 2 major papers. You also need to meet with someone from the writing center for both of these papers. The class is time very consuming, but Prof Flynn is a nice & helpful teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2011<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Flynn is fantastic! She is approachable and really loves what she is doing. I enjoyed coming to class to better understand the material! She is a tough grader though. I will be taking another class of hers this fall!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2011<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Makes material very interesting and clear. Good class discussions. Lots of quizzes and exams but if you read the material and go to class you won't have a problem. Easy to talk to and is quick to get back to you. Lots of extra credit.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2011<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Flynn is one of the nicest teachers in the department. Yes, her class is hard and she will notice small mistakes, but if this is your major, you will be so thankful to her because your writing will be that much better as a result. prompt at answering emails and always willing to help as much as she can, highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2010<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AMAZING teacher!!! She makes everything so clear and simple! Offers tons of extra credit so if you take advantage you can raise your grade a whole letter! She's super nice, super helpful, and really gives you the opportunity to get an A. P.S. she looks great too, which makes it easy to come to class!;)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/29/2010<br>Class Name: PSYCH105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr Flynn was an okay professor. I was expecting a little more from the class..i didn't enjoy going to it at all, i found it really boring and her test were alot harder than i expected. You have to make sure and read the readings because she does put the stuff on the tests. otherwise it was an okay class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2010<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. If you go to class & pay attention, and follow the rubrics of the papers & turn them in on time, you will do well. She is helpful and she genuinely wants her students to do well. The exams do cover a lot of information, like any psychology class. But she's more than willing to meet during office hours and provide help if you need it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2010<br>Class Name: PSY363<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Always willing to help, i have taken her twice and both classes were very clear and outlined, makes it very clear what she wants in order for you to succeed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2009<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her intro class was my fantastic! She is very well-informed, is interested in hearing how you connect to the material and knows how to present the course in a way that isn't so boring that you're asleep and so fast-paced that you can't keep up. I highly suggest taking a course with her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2009<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take Andrea. If you ever take a psych course, take it with this woman. She is extremely helpful. She is really nice and she wants you to succeed! I've taken her multiple times and have gotten A's every class. Not too much hw either.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2009<br>Class Name: PSY361<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the first teacher I've had that was a graduate student- but you would never be able to tell. Her teaching style is very effective & is extremely helpful outside of class. If you need to take the Psy capstone, take it with her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2008<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Teacher. Class is all HW, Quizzes, Papers, Tests, and Experimental Study Participation. She gives extra credit on almost EVERYTHING. Only vice is that her tests sometimes ask random questions for study, (ex. Kurt Cobain did barbituates T or F) Overall great teacher and HOT (don't get distracted)!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She really wants her class to succeed! If you pay attention to lectures and look over the material before class it is an easy class to get an A in. Great class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2008<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Flynn is adorable!  She knows her stuff and really wants to help.  One thing, sometimes I think she feels like she's teaching high school students. It's okay to treat us more like adults! Really though, great class, you'll learn but you won't have to bend over backwards to get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2008<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought she was an awesome teacher... Her tests were hard but she curved them. I got an A and didn't show up to a few of the classes. She's really nice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2008<br>Class Name: PSY364<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've taken her twice for Health Psychology and Psy 106 and i love her! She's very easy going and the class was easy- just show up and take notes. The midterm and final were multiple choice and she does not try to trick you!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2008<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Andrea is a really nice lady. She doesn't have a midterm or final, only 3 tests and some inclass work. You have to know the material to get an A, but if you attend class you should have no problem.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2007<br>Class Name: PSYCH105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She taught a very balanced course - lectures were very fun and there was almost no homework. The catch&#63; The exams were above average in difficulty - you really had to understand the material to get an A. However, in my oppinion that was justified given the lack of homework. She wasn't an attendance fiend, but whoever didn't come missed out on 2 thi</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2007<br>Class Name: PSY363<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very hard grader!! Likes to teach the class like it were an english class-constantly talking about spelling, grammar etc. I learned a lot, but for a grad student, she really takes herself too seriously, and believes everyone loves research and should be very smart when it comes to that!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2006<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the most eccentric psy teacher that I have ever had/met. She is full of energy all the time and seems so passionate about the subject. I &lt;3 the activites that she came up went especially since it was night class. The exams are a bit tricky, you must seriously know the material. If you just take notes and read you're okay.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2006<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hated her.  She threw to much info out in one night class and she was boring as hell.  I got a C, but I know I could have done better had I done more of the the readings.  Quiz ever week and 3 exams.  Study the questions in the chapter review and youre set for the quizzes, the tests are tricky and difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2006<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very helpful teacher. she was always in a good mood, ready to teach and answer questions. exams were a bit tricky, but never difficult. do your readings, go to each class (notes from powerpoint slides are very helpful) and do well on the quizzes/in class writing assignments. not hard to get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2006<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2006<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>easy class. lectures consisted of power point presentations. about 4 easy in-class writing assignments. 3 exams, also easy. just study notes taken in class, and glance over the book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2006<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard tests, no homework.
