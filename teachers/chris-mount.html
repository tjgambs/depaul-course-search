Very unbiased and VERY accepting of all opinions. I don't think he ever disagreed with anyone ever. It was either "Yes, and..." or "Fair point, but have you ever thought of it this way?" Reading was never too much to handle.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2014<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>lots of reading, 4 writing assignments, nothing else but attend class and discuss readings great teacher, great class. super helpful</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/18/2014<br>Class Name: REL237<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was looking forward to the class, but the professor is pretentious and the class was far more difficult than a 200 level religion course should be. I took it as an elective and found myself spending more time on it than my major courses so I dropped. More work than it was worth, and the online lectures were unbearable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2013<br>Class Name: REL237<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I wish I would have seen the comments before I signed up for this online class.

His quizzes and final were ridiculously impossible, tons of reading, and paper were difficult to get a good grade on. I'm sure he is a smart professor, but he's not very helpful or good at teaching.

Now, after taking an online course, I can honestly say I'll never take another of his courses.  The readings were extremely difficult to understand and the pro. was rarely there to answer questions.  The quizzes were also near impossible.  Everything was worth 4 points.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2013<br>Class Name: REL233<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not what I expected. Tons of reading each week, impossible quizzes, 2 group papers, a final paper, and a final exam. Don't get me wrong, the professor knows alot about the subject, but this class was extremely tough. If you take this class, be prepared to take an extensive amount of notes on the readings and lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2013<br>Class Name: REL238<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had weekly readings of well over 100 pages of scripture, weekly quizzes with questions that are not always answered in the readings, but rather he expects you to interpret scripture in the same way he does. Also, weekly discussion posts that are not always graded fairly. This class will consume all of your time! My advice is STAY AWAY.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2013<br>Class Name: REL237<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's highly educated and interested in what he's teaching and the class was both interesting and very easy.

If you are looking for an easy class where you don't have to read, this is not a good class for you. Many people complain about reading - well, this is college, you have to read. If you actually want to learn, regardless of your religion or lack thereof, he's great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2012<br>Class Name: REL238<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is by far my favorite professor. He is so knowledgable and passionate about what he teaches. He keeps class interesting and really changed how I view religion/jesus. I'm not super catholic but i loved this class. Optional midterm (extra credit for final) and final paper. A lot of writing but it's so rewarding and makes you think. Take his class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2011<br>Class Name: REL233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>wow. many people that comment on this site are really slow and are looking for classes that feeds their stupidity. Mount is an excellent professor. He speaks with clarity, meets students at their skill level, and makes class really engaging. Take this prof. if you want to get your money's worth and not some watered down worthless education.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2011<br>Class Name: REL238<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take this class if you are going have any other classes with any other homework. He is passionate but gives way too much reading and you have to write journal responses due every class. Unless you are passionate about this stuff DON'T TAKE IT! its hard analysis work and endless reading along with too many books to buy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2011<br>Class Name: CTH214<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>prepare to read a lot.

The professor goes out of his way to help students who struggle with the material.  His style of teaching is engaging and his lectures are never boring. Take one of his classes, he's among the best teachers at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2011<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DAUNTING CLASS. Have to understand and adopt a lot of his academic jargon to do well on papers. Plan your schedule around it.

I learned a lot, but I agree with the rest of the comments. It was challenging. There are three papers and you have to read about 8 books and write responses (2 pages) per class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2010<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is considerably challenging, but that's just it. Any class about religions is going to be tough because the subject matter itself is hard to grasp. I was lucky enough to have a passionate professor like Mount to make it a little easier to understand! My advice, consider that this will be your hardest class and plan the rest accordingly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2010<br>Class Name: RELIG105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took this as part of the honors requirement. This is NOT a blow off class. If you had that in mind, don't bother picking this class. There is daily 1.5 page essays. Lots of reading. The midterm and final paper will require WC help if you want a good grade. The only good things I can say is he's very helpful, will respond to emails.

At first, I thought there was too much work, but all the work he has us do really help our grade. I definitely recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2005<br>Class Name: REL235<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Daily response questions, very helpful,clear, 3 short papers and 2 tests, you have to keep up with the reading for response questions but its pretty light.

I feel like the only people that should take the class are those who are looking to be priests.  I got a low B.  I just don't think I should waste my B's/C's on a class that has absolutely nothing to do with what I want to do with my life.  Yuck.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2005<br>Class Name: CTH213<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>awesome teacher.  very entousiastic, but weighs the map quizzes a bit too much.  i got B's and A's on everything except for one map quiz and i got a C in the course.  very smart and interesting otherwise, and much easier to take seriously now that his comb-over is gone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: REL233<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very enthusiastic about his subjects.

Too much reading, not enough time. Couldn't figure out his grading scheme or what he was looking for. One night I'd spend three hours on a response and get a 3 and the next day I'd write my paper in class and get a 5. Don't get it... Nice guy though, although he did kinda insult my beliefs</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2005<br>Class Name: REL233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT TEACHER! makes you work for your grade, but its worth it. he is very helpful and will never turn down an appointment/phone call/or email.

In this course he goes over religion as a subject more so than individual religions.  I learned a great deal because of readings and everyones opinions are heard in class talks.
