If you don't do the reading prior to class, or just copy word for word the procedure from your lab manual w/o digesting the info, you will have a problem.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2013<br>Class Name: CHE231<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: C+</div><div id="right"><div>Vanessa was a really cool person, but she didn't know what she was saying. Her usual response to any question is what does your lab manual say? She absolutely can't explain any concept and I had the worst time in her lab. She is an easy grader, but you can't do the assignment when you have no idea how to do it. AVOID taking her.</div></div></div></body></html>
