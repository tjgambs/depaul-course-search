However, every single night I went home and taught the material to myself after lecture. It was a very rare day when I understood it and didn't have to have the book teach it to me -- and on top of that complete the daily homework. His style of teaching was very unclear.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2015<br>Class Name: 310311<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: C</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy, but can't say anything positive abt his teaching. If you can, take someone else. Lectures were consistently confusing, wkshts every class (for attpart), hw due every class, three exams. Key to the class: focus on hw and hw makes up exams. Basically use the book and teach yourself with help of tutoring laboffice hrs.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2015<br>Class Name: MAT151<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>If you can find another professor, I'd say go for it. I took him because there were no other options this quarter for Calculus II. He is non-linear, kind of all over the place, and does not give clear lectures. I did not have a tough time with Calculus in general, but his class was tough. Attendance mandatory, worksheets everyday, and curved exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2014<br>Class Name: MAT131<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2014<br>Class Name: MAT131<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took him because he was the only teacher available for this class, but I recommend waiting until another quarter if that is the case. I was forced to reteach myself or go to the tutoring center for each assignment, which did not fit well into my schedule and caused me to fall behind. He skips over a lot of essential material. Avoid.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2014<br>Class Name: 320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His passion for geometry really made this course awesome! He knows his stuff and will try to do anything to help you pass. Has two midterms and a final. Along with weekly homework and a written project. I failed the first midterm but ended up with a B in the class. Everyone else who say he's a horrible professor are completely wrong.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2014<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Go to class! Everyday you do a worksheet and he takes the worksheets together and creates exam. Very easy class if you show up and work on the worksheets. Study those!!! No need for textbook everything is online for my math lab plus.

He was all over the place in terms of teaching and you couldn't understand what he was saying half of the time. He's awkward and super boring. I took calculus in HS before this class and he still manages to confuse me. I'd find another professor if possible...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2012<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is a horrible teacher, he doesn't help at all and his grading is unfair.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2012<br>Class Name: MTH131<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Grades really hard. 2 Midterms that are 60% of your grade final 30% of the grade!

Super entertaining at times, but he lacks the ability to lay out the information in a process that i felt was understandable or pertaining to the homework assigned.

If you ask him questions or ask him to review material he will. Be prepared to re-teach yourself everything you learn in class. DON'T BUY THE BOOK! midterms are really hard.

It's calulus! It's hard! (On top of that, MAT 152/162/172 Calculus III is the hardest in the sequence.) Also, I got lazy and stopped coming to class... Whoops. Lots of people didn't like him, but I did.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2009<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was not very clear when displaying mathematical concepts to explain the material. He speaks softly and is too qick in responding to questions to understand the answer with clarity. Not a good professor, take someone else who can be clearer and more helpful when answering questions. I give him a 3 out of 10.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2008<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>people give him a hard time, but he is a really good professor. He does speak very softly, so get to class early and sit near the front. He is very helpful and an easy grader though. He will answer any question you have, and explain it to you one on one until you get it. Overall GREAT professor!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2008<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>horrible teacher. difficult to understand and tests are very hard.

People are really mean to this guy! His class is not so bad at all. If you work hard, you will do fine. He curves the midterms and finals. I ended up with a B+.

I recommend him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Never uses the textbook, uses an online system called My Math Lab which was very difficult to use..

The class was sooo easy and everything is online. You get 2 weeks to turn in your homework and while he's explaining new material, you can get all the hmwk done. If you know someone in class it's easier because you can sutdy for the ONLINE QUIZZES or do them together. It's really easy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2008<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly, he's not the greatest professor.  He is a little scatter brained, but he means well.  And it's basically a review from highschool, I didn't learn anything new. Be sure to ask him questions, because he doesn't stop and hold your hand along the way. This is college, if you don't know ask. Only 3 tests, and he's not that bad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2007<br>Class Name: MAT103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His test can be tricky.

You MUST come to class with questions for the midterm and final or he will not review and move on to teach new things.  If you want a chance to do well you must to the homework but even then he throws random problems on his tests, his class is not a cakewalk.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2007<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Funny man who wanders the room as he explains new topics.

If you pay attention in class and ask questions, you'll be fine. His class is funny and goofy because he likes to talk to himself (goofy). Like i said, if you do your work, you'll be fine.

He is willing to help, but gives you that expression of 'Duh!' you should know this by now. A complicated man himself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2004<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>make sure you know the stuff b4 taking his class - he breezes through material and doesn't stop if you have questions. he doesn't have an attendance policy however so that rocks</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2004<br>Class Name: MTH130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WOW!! How does he still 'teach&#63;'  Horrible teacher.  I got an A only because I knew material prior.  He is horrible.  Very unclear on what he expects for answers on tests, and he mumbles all class.  Do try to take someone else.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2004<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He goes at a fast pace and has a hard time explaining things.  He only goes over easy example problems in class then hits you with extremely hard problems on tests.  You never know what to study for and your grade will suffer because of it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2004<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do NOT take him! Disorganized, doesn't know what he's talking. Tests and quizzes unclear...you never know what to expect on them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2004<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very smart and does not really know how to teach lower level classes</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2004<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is HORRIBLE. Do not take him unless you want to leave math feeling more confused then when you went in. He laughed at students questions and talked down to our class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2004<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I wouldn't recommend him. I left feeling confused and he is not very willing to help. Very scatterbrained and unorganized.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2004<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He goes at a fast pace but he's very willing to go back over anything that you might not understand fully.  He doesn't bog you down with tons of homework problems, the homework isn't due until the class after next, and all the tests are graded on a curve.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2003<br>Class Name: MAT310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him for Geometry (he wrote the book) and Abstract Algebra, and I must say that I was more confused everyday when I left.  He FLIES through material, and usually skips around to complete proofs.  Tests are long, but &quot;curved&quot; slightly</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2003<br>Class Name: MATH130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very cool teacher !!
