First truly hands on experiential class at DePaul. We're learning tons of new brainstorming skills every class. If you're wanting a typical college lecture in this class, you won't get it. But if you want to learn to solve problems and come up with creative ideas - this class is it! Love everything about it :D</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2013<br>Class Name: MGT373<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A kind lady with lots of passion. Extremely disorganized. Every time I walked into the classroom I felt like was entering a tornado.

I actually look forward to going to it. Her lectures help take a potentially dry subject and make it real. She cares and has little tricks to help us remember concepts. Study for the midterm, though. It's hard. The interview and article presentations have helped me understand management. Interesting class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2011<br>Class Name: MGT573<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the best class at DePaul..Creativity in Management is Simpson's sweet spot. I wish we had more active classes like this. Trade books not text books, a couple of articles, lots of brainstorming techniques. Take this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2011<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was not a very easy grader. There is one group project, two partner ones, and a midterm. If you do good on the midterm, there won't be a final. Her power points are not very useful. I'd say that the book is clearer. There are some extra credit opportunities. I would take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2011<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fabulous Class! We chose our own cases so learned about companies we were interested in, her lectures were interesting & the thought leader articles we discussed great! Also, the simulation was a fun way to learn about all the decisions made in strategically running a company. The teams with slackers had less fun...GET A GOOD TEAM!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2010<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her teaching strategy seems to be to grade really hard and then offer a ton of extra credit. Extra credit is EASY or involves going to the career center. But because there is a lot of work in the class no one works hard on the EC. WORK HARD ON THE E.C. she gives SO much</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2010<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best Class at DePaul! We got to see the actual impact of what we learned in a company in a simulation game. Many teams ranked globally & we had fun with it! Loved my team! Also, good, relevant cases studies - she walked us through the analysis process with several examples in class before we presented for our grade. Only warning - get a good team!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2010<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had her on my first Grad Class.

Loves to open up topics and definitely not boring</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/15/2010<br>Class Name: GSB599<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This prof is unique...the work on the simulation is intense, but she had us competing on a global level - and it was fun! The teams without good group dynamics didn't enjoy it as much but she was available to help. Case studies were current & HBR articles relevant. She had more than most profs, but I'm using it! How often do you say that&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2010<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved this class! Have heard only great things about this professor and they were right! She expects us to work but is available when we need help, has clear and detailed assignments and syllabus. If you want to learn, participate (do something other then sit & listen to lectures), this clas is for you. I really feel prepared for my next classes!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2010<br>Class Name: GSB599<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very disorganized and has very selective grading.  Claims to have real world experience but does not demonstrate it.  She is very very unreasonable assigning homeworks and is all obssessed about blackboard posting.  Does not grade anything until the class is done, yet expects stundets to meet all deadlines. DO NOT TAKE HER.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2010<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is awful.  She tries to jam pack too much into 10 weeks.  In addition, she is a very hard grader and it is totally unfair that the class is mostly group projects.  Take someone else if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2010<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy A. Lots of fun, I met many people I am still in contact with. So it is a good networking class. The teacher is smart, blond, and outgoing so everyone loved class and tried to show up on time. I have used some of the things I learned at work, I cannot say that for some of the other required classes. All and all, a great summer class & hot prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2010<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy A.

But you don't learn much from her. Lots of work but useless types of work. A bit disorganized. If you want to learn something better not take her but if you want to get easy A then she's good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2009<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Quite possibly one of the most incompetent teachers around. Assigns tons of busy work, assignment due dates aren't on the syllabus (and you'll get it last minute, too), grading is completely subjective and roundabout. It's clear she makes it most of this up as she goes. Disappointing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2009<br>Class Name: MGT535<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was a major disappointment. She tries hard to teach well and wants students to learn, but she is an awful professor. Class is as dry as they come, she inundates you with informationa and her guidelines are plentiful yet unclear. Grading is subjective. She was successful in the business world and should strongly consider re-entering it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2009<br>Class Name: MGT535<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not only did we create change for others, but this class changed me & my group! She uses this Know-Do-Be method & I loved learning this way. We ended up with exposure to dozens of tools (Know) but we actual became change agents in two projects(Do &then Be). It really culminated for me in the final presentations. I am already using what I learned!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2009<br>Class Name: MGT573<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Finally, a discussion oriented class that respects our knowledge as professionals! We stuck to the syllabus, explored HBR cases and thought leader theory, relevant real world events were compared to the Change models we learned in class, and we created two projects. She lectured some but her style is more to facilitate our learning. I loved this!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2009<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>We had to work really hard the second half, but it was worth it. We have a new venture business plan we're proud of!! All of her individual assignments and the test fed into the final New Venture launch project so they kept our team on track. She also had guest lecturers and inclass brainstorming we couldn't have experienced otherwise. Loved it!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/28/2009<br>Class Name: MGT573<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cares about her students and loves teaching, but she is bad at it. Not a difficult course, but grading is subjective (you'll have no idea why you got the grade you did). I was looking forward to taking this class and it was a major disappointment. Information overload as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/26/2009<br>Class Name: MGT590<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Finally getting around to this posting. Dr. Simpson was in her element with this course. This class had everything - guest lecturers, great projects, interesting readings, you tubes. She should have tenure!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2009<br>Class Name: MGT535<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This instructor was completely unfair. Peer evaluations were 40% of class grade. Guidelines are unclear. Class was boring, and I'd never take her again. Class is very boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2009<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As others have mentioned, Prof Simpson is passionate and knowledgeable about the material, but is also somewhat scattered.  It's relatively easy to get an A if you keep up with the assignments and online discussions, but I didn't find the course particularly effective.  I didn't learn as much from the class as I hoped, unfortunately.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2009<br>Class Name: MGT650<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was unorganized and ridiculously easy.  Sure it is an easy A but I just wasted $3,500 for this simple class.  This was supposed to be a capstone class and it turned out to be geared toward an undergraduate student.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/13/2009<br>Class Name: MGMT500<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There was an information overload for this class, and it was a waste of paper.

While this can be time-consuming, you also have to do your group business project which is very time-consuming.  Overall, I enjoyed it.  Prof. was a good problem solver and very flexible with us.  Just hang in there because this is an MBA class, not any lower lev</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2009<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor was terrible at giving directions or telling you what she expected in assignments. There was not a midterm and the final was self graded. Give yourself a good grade on the final, she won't change it much, come to class, and you can guarantee an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2009<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved Dr. Simpson. She clearly cared about her students and what we learned! She lectured the first few classes and then the rest of the class we discussed articles and students presented cases and topics. The learning just kind of happened. I found out learning doesn't have to be painful!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2008<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class has so much potential, but Dr. Simpson is just not organized enough or clear enough to make an effective impact.  With so much information to cover, it is nearly impossible to walk away with more than a few small factoids about OB.  Class is taught with Powerpoint and articles/HW.  Most units are presented by other students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2008<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would take her class again.

Lots of energy in the competition and great information in class. She knows her material.

Her discussion board postings seem like busy work. On top on the Capsim game, she had us do cases, articles, and Capsim assigments on a weekly basis. Too much coffee intake... she is too hyper! BTW: do not buy the book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/07/2008<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took it over the summer, cheat sheet allowed for the midterm.  NO FINAL exam, but there is a group presentation instead.  A lot of work and presentations, but if you do it, you will be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2008<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class consists of group work, class discussions, lots of busy work, and a final.  It's a very easy A, just beware you will have no idea what your grade is until the very last class.  I agree with previous reviewers that stated she is disorganized but the class is an easy A and the class discussion are entertaining and benefical.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2008<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I do agree, she was very disorganized. But you do learn alot in this class. Just let me warn you it is very time consuming. You have to write alot on discussion broads and the clients we work for can pretty much ask for anything( A.K.A. Excessive workload). I honestly believe the professor should limits on how much the client could ask for.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2008<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought this class was great! We had lots of opportunity to learn about topics that laid down the basics of management and learned about ourselves in the process.

Lots of take home activities. Class discussion was interesting. Great as a survey course but little depth. As mentioned by others the grading I back loaded some 90% of you grade comes in the final class or two.

However too much material and prep work and then it was never covered and the little activities were a waste of time. She talks about organization and feedback, yet she is unorganized and does not give you the majority of grades until after the quarter is over.

Class is super boring and the activities are pointless. Every week you have to read and article and then your group presents it.

The class gets interesting after the midterm and NO final. Everyone passes. Just read the material and the study guide.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2005<br>Class Name: MNG300<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a good teacher. She makes the notes available on blackboard and then reads them in class. Stupid little group projects that don't help in teaching you anything! Mid term was horibble- mc-t/f-and 10 short answers. She's crazy!Advice:read, read, read!- as you'll learn nothing from her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2005<br>Class Name: MGT320<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The exams are okay but you really need to study and look over every detail on the handouts and book.
