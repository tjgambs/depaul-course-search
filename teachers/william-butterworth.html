Got an A with Butterworth. Super easy and friendly. Don't even need the book, homework isn't mandatory. He is very cheery and won't make you feel stupid. He likes giving little math history facts like who invented the quadratic, which will be extra credit on quizzes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/09/2014<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: P</div><div id="right"><div>Love this professor. He is very funny, has a high interest in his students doing well and is able to teach the subject clearly so the material isn't confusing. You have to put in the effort but overall if you do you'll do good.  He has very accessible office hours and is always there before class to help answer students' questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/05/2014<br>Class Name: MAT147148149<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an amazing teacher, he will have quiz at least once a week, but the quiz are all easy if you follow the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2014<br>Class Name: MAT147<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's one of the best math teachers I've had. He gives many examples and is funny and relatable. I had him for the entire sequence, and I felt like I learned a ton from him. There are weekly quizzes, but he drops a few. He let us use a cheat sheet for our final for this quarter :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2014<br>Class Name: MAT147<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fantastic professor!

I didn't fully realize this until I took MAT 136 with Doyle and saw the difference. I would highly recommend him for a tough a subject. I took this over the summer so it was quick paced, but if your willing to put in the effort you will do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2013<br>Class Name: MAT147<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Butterworth is literally the nicest professor I have ever had. He gives you every chance to succeed. I wish I had done better in this class because he was so nice, but I just suck at math. Go to office hours and tutoring if you're like me and math just goes over your head. He is very helpful and understanding.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/27/2013<br>Class Name: MATT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher.  Taught at a relaxed pace, pausing at critical points to make sure everyone was on board.  Taught material in a logically forward way, from known to unknown.  Used examples and explanation.  Was capable of teaching material in different ways for different students.  Calm, patient, non-judgmental and had a sense of humor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/03/2013<br>Class Name: MAT147<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Literally the best class I've ever taken in college. Professor Butterworth is great at explaining things, super helpful, funny, and a generous grader. He is willing to work with you if you put in the effort! No reason you shouldnt get an A in calc.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took the course as a refresher and a bit out of boredom. Professor was always early and helping everyone out, seemed to be genuinely concerned w everyone's success. I highly recommend him!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2013<br>Class Name: MAT148<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Got an A but if you want to take your calc III series, do not take it with him! You will have to learn everything via YouTube. His notes are all over the place and super messy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2013<br>Class Name: MAT146<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took the entire 146-7-8 sequence. I could not have asked for a better professor to learn calc from. Math isn't my strong suit, and I've never done calc until these classes. But he made everything crystal clear and perfectly understandable. Very accessible outside of class, and is always willing to work with his students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2012<br>Class Name: MATH147<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. William Butterworth was one of the best professors I have ever met. Compared to other classes, he made his calculus series classes lot more convenient and easier to manage. I definitely recommend taking him if you really need to fulfill general ed requirements because for those who do not feel very competent at math, he is meant just for you!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2012<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I personally don't find math classes to be very easy however I really have enjoyed his class. He's clear in his assignments and goes over things more than once. A great instructor who I hope teaches MAT 136/137.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2011<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was afraid this class would be too difficult for me, and while it wasn't easy, Prof. Buterworth was very clear about assignments and exams and was always willing to give extra help.  His positive attitude really helped me not only get through it, but do well and actually learn something.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/21/2011<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best math teacher I have ever had!

I decided to retake my Calc class during the summer with Professor Butterworth and am so happy I did. Not only did I finish with an A but Professor Butterworth is there for his students 110%. Come to class take notes and you'll end up with an A!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2011<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class with Gang Wang in the Spring and learned NOTHING! I took this again this summer with Professor Butterworth, got a B, and now I completely understand the material.  He is great for people that just don't grasp math easily.  He has numerous handouts that really help students to learn the material.  Best math teach i've had at DePaul</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2011<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher does not meet the definition of academic.

Good sense of humor. Does plenty of examples in class and has quizzes that are actually on the material he goes over. Two tests and a final, one of the tests gets dropped. Really not that difficult, it's simple math. I got a 100% on the second test(two extra credit questions). Can be dull for a night class but like I said, not that hard</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2010<br>Class Name: MAT147<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i've never understood math or enjoyed it before taking his class. this guy is too awesome. learning is interactive, he didn't just stand and lecture for the entire 3 hours. if you can take his class- DO IT. you will not regret it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2010<br>Class Name: MAT147<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him for MAT 147/8/9. Take him for cal seq. No idea how he makes cal as clear as he does in such an early, long class. Bubbly, energetic, caring, & down to earth personality. The best math teacher I have ever had. Drops one quiz & one exam (not final), he's realistic. Show up, listen, do ur work, & review material, & u should get a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2010<br>Class Name: MAT148<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've had Professor Butterworth for two quarters now and I think he is the best professor me. I am not a math person and I don't think I would have made it this far in math if not for his teaching style. Very helpful. Definitely take him if you are not inherently good at math</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2009<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Butterworth is a great professor and person. I had him for MAT 150 and 151 over the summer and got a solid A in both classes. He gives a lot of quizzes, but they help prepare you for the midterms which are not bad. I was nervous about taking calculus because I hadn't taken math in a year, but he is really great! He is EXTREMELY helpful outside </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/30/2009<br>Class Name: MAT151<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Summer session = HARD! Butterworth managed to get all the material in and still answer questions. Uses worksheets (helpful), exams have sections(choose 5 of 7), favorable grading, drops one daily quiz and even a mid-term from final grade! Final was comprehensive and very hard. Study quizes, attempt all the homework, study lecture notes. Got an A...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2009<br>Class Name: MAT148<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I struggled with math all through high school and was very nervous to take this class.  Butterworth is the best teacher ever!  He spells everything out and by the end of clss, its clear.  Yes, he has a difffernt sense of humor, but thats what makes the class enjoyable.  I have learned so much from him and would recommend him to anyone!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2008<br>Class Name: MAT147<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hated calc.  He was a great professor who actually cared about the subject he was teaching.  He definitely found enjoyment in it which makes class more enjoyable also.  He knows what he's talking about so ASK QUESTIONS. He will always answer then and not look down upon you for them.  Don't be late, he doesn't appreciate it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/07/2008<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guys humor is very annoying.  His method of teaching is dry and unclear.  I really did not like him.  His anecdotal explanations usually made me more confused than I started out.  Anyone who is not proficient in Math should steer clear of his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/11/2008<br>Class Name: CALC2<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Does not follow syllabus.  Does not clearly answer what is going to be on tests.  Does not help at all. Slacker teacher.  I would highly encourage others not to take his class.  Fake nice.

Math is all about the teacher.  This guy and his pre-calc class gave me the WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY ENTIRE UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE CAREER.  I will be making extensive efforts to tell people what a flippant person this guy is.  Do not take this guy's class he is AWFUL.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/17/2008<br>Class Name: MATH200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent prof!  I had Calc II with Gang Wang over the summer and ended up with a C-. I decided to retake the course knowing I'd get a better grade with a professor that actually knew how to teach.

I had this class at *:30 in the morning and I had to drive 1 1/2 hours to get there! But it was all worth it! Class was so easy and he was very funny!! I recomend him for everyone! He helps everyone and treats everyone the same! He is so ggood I switched my adviser to him!!

He breaks down calculus into something everyone can comprehend. Historically, I never was good at math, but I ended up with a good grade in this class because he is an amazing professor. If you don't take Bill, you’re an idiot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2007<br>Class Name: MAT152<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Butterworth is super nice, really funny, and always available for help. He gives partial credit on tests, and you really have to not know what's going on to get a decent grade. Also, if you go in for help, he's more lenient on the grading :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2007<br>Class Name: MTH152<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is hillarious. i love this man. although i didnt do so well in his class, that is what makes him just so awesome, is that he still makes it worth going. highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2007<br>Class Name: MAT147<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Butterworth is an amazing teacher. He's extremely clear and thorough with the work, and homework is not manditory. It lets you focus more on learning the material instead of trying to get answers to turn in for a grade. It made the class alot easier for me, as math is not my favorite subject. I would definitely recommend him. Two thumbs up!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2007<br>Class Name: MTH152<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is so hillarious. the book doesn't help much, so you have to rely on his notes for the best examples of what you would see on the exams.
