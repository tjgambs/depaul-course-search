However, I seriously struggled in this class due to the fact that his classes are STRICTLY lecture with no visual aid whatsoever. He talks very fast which makes it difficult to process the information and I had no idea what to study for the test. If you are a visual learner STAY AWAY or else you will FAIL. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2015<br>Class Name: HST111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor when it comes to teaching. He is a great teacher and you'll learn a lot. One paper which is not difficult, but three tests which are graded much too hard for a 100 level class. If you care about your grade I would steer clear. You will learn a lot, but likely at the expense of a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2015<br>Class Name: HST182<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His lectures are very long, but he's really passionate about what he teaches so they were always really interesting. There was no textbook, just three short books and then an extra book you pick for a book report. Three exams based on the lectures and they are essay questions. It's a tough class to do well in if you miss a day and don't take notes</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2015<br>Class Name: HST111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Nelson is hands down one of the best history professors I've had the fortune of enrolling into. His approach to history is one that is light and fun which makes the material just that much more digestible. Furthermore, his class was consisted of 3 exams and a paper, what more could you want as a college student? Take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2015<br>Class Name: HST181<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There are 3 tests worth 25% of your grade each, a short paper, and participation.

You should record the lectures because he talks fast when he gets super into it. The tests are essay so make sure you know the little details.

Class is not very difficult however the tests are graded with absolute vengeance and what he expects on them is absolutely unclear.

Its was a pleasure to be in this class. I highly recommend.Go to class take good notes you will do well! its a fun class, enjoy it there are not that many classes like that. My advice do the first paper only 5 pages u will understand once u get in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2013<br>Class Name: HST181<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jay Nelson is on of the best teachers you can get. His lectures will get you interested in history, and he's often available if you need help with anything. This is a mostly lecture based class, but you just have to show up and jot some things down. he also reviews before so no confusion. He sometimes talks  kinda fast but that's my only complaint</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2013<br>Class Name: HST181<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of reading from different historical books was necessary - 4 books total.

His entire class is a lecture so bring your laptop and expect to be typing the entire time. With that said, his lectures are VERY interesting and easy to follow. His tests are straight from his lectures and if you listen, you'll do well. Awesome guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2013<br>Class Name: HST183<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>its a lecture class so write down everything he say or bring your computer. He so helpful, if you got to his office and ask what to expect on the test he will give you about 90-95 percent of the test. Also go to his class and ask how you should study for his class. I got a B because i bombed test then went to office hours and got A's on the rest.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2012<br>Class Name: HST183<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher and knows alot about history. One day a week he speaks about current events for about 15 mins. The whole class is note taking so id suggest bringing your laptop or a recorder.  I STRONGLY SUGGEST SEEING HIM IN HIS OFFICE TO ASK ON HOW TO STUDY FOR THE CLASS AND WHAT TO EXPECT ON THE TEST. great teacher and a good guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2010<br>Class Name: HST182<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really loved his teaching style.  There is a gargantuan amount of notes, so if you're an A student, be prepared to deal with a B in this course because the tests can be somewhat tricky.  Otherwise, he's one of the best professors at DePaul. I love that he opens each class with a 15 minute discussion on current events.  He's pretty witty as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2009<br>Class Name: HST182<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I need 4 words to best describe this man-one of a kind!He is so very helpful, funny and handsome.

His tests are deplorable, which produced a class average of a &quot;D''.  If that is the sort of grade you want, then I would take this class, you'll most likely learn something even though it is a high school level.  He is also very rude, he will not let you speak at times.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2009<br>Class Name: HST182<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher! He really enjoys what he teaches. No textbook, but two required books that were interesting reads. Don't miss a class, because he talks fast and gives us so much info in just one class. Tests are straightforward. Just make sure you read the books assigned and take good notes!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2009<br>Class Name: HIST0<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor nelson is very good at what he does.  One day a week class is tough, dont miss class.  Keep good notes, visit often during office hours.  test are not easy, due to the amount of information.  3 tests on class lectures and 3 books.

It is all lecture so attendance is crucial, but I promise not painful. Yes he's good looking, but very witty and insightful. He stays objective, gives history a new light, and so so helpful. One of the nicest and more approachable professors at depaul. A must if you love history.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2009<br>Class Name: HIS183<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a really good teacher.

Every class I felt like I was writing everything he said down because he expects alot on his tests.  No textbooks just his notes so dont ever miss class.  Three tests one paper.
