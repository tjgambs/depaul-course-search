The projects he assigned helped me grow so much as an artist and he gives really great feedback.

His suggestions on our projects were helpful and he was always willing to help through email as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2012<br>Class Name: ART264<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this class.
