Assigns an over the top amount of homework, very rude to her students, and her lectures will put you to sleep. Find another class! I'm learned nothing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2015<br>Class Name: HAA231<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked the class and she was very knowledgable on everything covered. However, she was ALWAYS late and didn't give feedback on ANY of the 4 papers we turned in (even when I emailed her for feedback). She was a good but very irresponsible professor. Don't waste money on buying the textbook for this course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2014<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am someone who likes to look for the best in others. I am usually good at it, too, but with this class (and specifically this teacher)...well, I can safely say that there are no redeeming qualities. In fact, I have lost faith in all humanity. I could write pages on what she did ineffectively, but there's a word limit on the comments section.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2014<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst class I've ever taken.

She  assigns way too much work to do every week. She clearly does not take into consideration that her class is not the only class her students take. I would completely avoid her online class if you are not prepared to spend most of your time on this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2013<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class online. She is not a tough grader and the material is not hard -but- the amount of work she assigns have become annoying. I'd rather do a few longer assignments than multiple, small, tedious assignments. So, be prepared for large but easy workload for her online class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2013<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Chill class, kinda rac1st but dont take it serious. It's true you don't get grades, but i doubt she is a hard grader. I got an A in the end and it was't too bad. No final, reflection papers (1 page) pretty much every week easy, 2 presentations,5 page essay on a movie about food.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2012<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teacher actually provided some useful and interesting facts, but lectures were mostly boring being 4 hours long. Sounded like a fun class at first but it turned out to be a drag in the end due to her rudeness. The only good parts about this class was leaving class for food and NO final. I would choose another LSP class before committing to this one</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2012<br>Class Name: HAA231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Zurybida is very helpful..she'll take her time to make sure you fully understand everything she is trying to teach! the paper was easy, but the exams were pretty difficult...over 100 slides to study from and only about 5 are on each quiz. I had a rough time with her class but she gave me a good grade..she is an easy grader..just come to class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2012<br>Class Name: HAA231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>prof. zurybida is kinda awesome. classes arent mandatory, but if you dont show you probably wont do well on exams. just saying. and she is really good about making time to talk to you if you have questions. she did require an 8 page paper without any internet sources. but seriously suck it up, take her class, and learn really interesting things.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/22/2011<br>Class Name: HAA230<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took her summer course to fill my A & L requirement.  No text.  Take notes in class and study off the slides she puts on D2L.  There was an 8 page paper on a piece of architecture but it wasn't so bad.  She made the class very interesting and fun.  Learned a lot!  Highly recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2011<br>Class Name: HAA230<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a very nice lady and very into the subject (kinda funny too). Though I admit the 8 page paper was a bit much for a summer class, if it were a reg. class it wouldn't have been so bad. Quizzes (4) are easy if you take notes & study a little before. No book, don't really even have to read the stuff online either if you take notes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2011<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's not that bad.... but she teaches this 100 level class like it's a 300 level class. she talks too fast for you to take notes, and expects a SIX PAGE PAPER on a piece of art WITHOUT using internet sources. kind of funny, but not really.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2011<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't understand why Professor Zurybida is getting loads of negative comments. She is seriously the coolest lady ever. Not to mention she has the funniest sense of humor. Don't be afraid to take her class. This lady is great and she made this topic SO incredibly interesting!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2011<br>Class Name: ART253<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's soooo nice! and her class isn't that hard. All you have to do is memorize. If your never gonna show up, this class isn't really for you, but the material isn't that bad and she's stright abotu what she wants. Kinda babbles sometimes, but over all a good teacher and easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2011<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Talked FOREVER about things that had absolutely no relevance to the class. Never got any of our work back. She would usually let us leave at 4 but we would be all the way across town so it ended up taking an hour to get back to Lincoln Park and even longer to get back to the loop. title of class makes it sound like fun but it is NOT!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2010<br>Class Name: HAA230<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked her teaching a lot. Class is just pretty much constant note taking but the midterm and final are not hard, if you can memorize stuff it'll take you two seconds to finish. You have to write an 8 page paper about a topic the only difficult thing about that is its length. she has favorites and jokes around in class good teacher overall.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/27/2010<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't understand all the bad ratings, she tried very hard to be engaging for all of the students which I really appreciate.  She's nice, she's approachable and I thought she was a very fair grader.  She has favorites, but she doesn't count that against the others in her class.  I found her class enjoyable and learned a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2010<br>Class Name: EXPLO5509<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWFUL, you will never get any feedback and she is a bore.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2009<br>Class Name: EXP111<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took her for Explore Chicago Through Food. She did not seem that bad at first, but as the class progressed I never recieved a grad efor any paper or reflection I had done. Her final is not that bad, but the lectures were a joke for a four hour long class. I would take but be weary.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2009<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she def. sucked!!! never any grades, loud mouthed, rudest teacher I ever had! she did not tell us what was on the final and the final was too hard at that! i thought taking a foods class would be fun but she made it the worst 4 hrs of my life! not to mention my class was on a friday...so we always started the weekend of horrible. she made it into a</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2009<br>Class Name: HAA230<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok, she is not a bad teacher at all! You get the choice of 3 2-3 pg essays or one 9 page essay (easy). One short quiz, midterm, and final (easy).  I don't get why she gets poor reviews, I did not apply myself too much, and thought this class was not bad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2009<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>oh, and forget about grades either, you'll never see a single one. The assignments are also overly hard, and all the stuff covered is worthless in every sense. There are good ways to look at the city's culture, and then there's the mind-numbing drivel you have to endure when taking this class. None of it was enlightening or educational in any sense</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2009<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Think taking a food-based explore chicago class sounds fun&#63; Well it's not, especially not with this bitter old hag teaching it! She is incredibly rude, the restaurants we went to were all horrible (except for one) and incredibly far away to boot, meaning we always got back way late.

Its more about culture than food. Interupts while giving presentations and most of the time its to point out what you did wrong. On haloween took us to a restaurant over an hour away didnt get back for an hour n 15 min. while she drove away in a cab.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2008<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OMG I almost forgot! After a girl missed class because her grandma died, zurybida had the nerve to ask for PROOF that her grandma died.

Another thing i forgot to add was that after she asked the girl if her dad was single, she next said &quot;Dont worry, I'm taken&quot;  She is very unpleasant and i strongly suggest that is more enjoyable and during a better time to have class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2008<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>continued.... referred to when blacks were called &quot;negroes&quot; for no necessary reason. When a girl was talking about her dad cooking dinner, zurybida cut her off and asked &quot;So your dad is single&#63;&quot; which offended her to some extent. She once also had the nerve to take a cab home from a restaurant over 30 minutes away from campus while we were all....</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2008<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>continued from previous review i just did.... she is politically incorrect. She has offended many people in my class. When discussing Indian food, she talked about how much she hated Indians that answer service calls.

Waste of a Friday afternoon (12-4). She takes the class way too seriously. She makes you study more about the country than food. You dont get grades back. Reflections every week. Your always late to get back.  More importantly, Zurybida made this class so unpleasant by being there. She is very arrogant and rude.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2008<br>Class Name: ART105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class nearly destroyed my interest in high art.  It was more of a memorization class than an art class.  She told us to memorize more than 100 paintings, yet only 5 were on the exam.  Not very helpful either; she once missed an office hours appointment.  Her grading is strict, more suitable for a 300-level than a 100-level class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/18/2008<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While the concept sounds wonderful, the restaurants visited aren't very accommodating for those with specific diets (vegetarian, kosher, etc).

A rediculous amount of notetaking though.. She's very helpful if you ask her questions in class, but don't try and email her- you'll never hear back from her.

It sounds like it will be an easy blowoff but its not.

She is also unnecessarily tough at grading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2005<br>Class Name: ARTHISTORY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i wasn't interested in art history at all before taking her class.  she was extremely interesting and very brilliant.  even funny at times!!! this was one of the best classes i have taken at depaul!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2004<br>Class Name: HON202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is extremely intelligent and has a good sense of humor.  Quizzes are pretty tough, but if you take good notes in her classes you will do fine.  Lectures can be a bit boring, but you really learn alot. Her course influenced me to go to the Louvre in Paris last spring break.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2004<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very Good Teacher. Goes over a lot of art and makes everything clear. Keeps you awake by having you write ALOT of notes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2004<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2004<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want a blow off class, this is not it! Course work is extreme...way too much, not to mention her grading. My friend just dropped because there was no way she could pass the class. I'd do the same, but I can't afford it. Take another teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2004<br>Class Name: ARTHIS<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a hard teacher, and this is supposed to be an easy class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2004<br>Class Name: HON203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This wasn't a &quot;real&quot; Art History class, but she fit an INSANE amount of information into 8 weeks and made it all clear, fun, and relevent.  She's funny and cool and highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2004<br>Class Name: HON202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Show up open-minded and you'll be fine. Interesting readings and 4 quizzes; even an extra credit field trip! She's super helpful and wicked smart. The only prob I had was dealing w/ elitist honors kids that ****ed about her desire to challenge us.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2004<br>Class Name: HON202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A funny lady, in a very snide and ****y way.  Knows a great deal about art, and is a good prof.  However, her quizzes are highly demanding, almost gratuitous.  Expects a hell of a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2004<br>Class Name: ARTHIST<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She taught me so much about how to look at art and identify where, when, and how it was created!  If you come to class and pay attention, you can't help but do well!  Gotta respect a full-figured woman confident enough to wear a black leather skirt!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2004<br>Class Name: HON202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Smart as hell, definitely an art snob. Intersting to listen to, but tough and a seemingly inconsistent grader. At least 1 curveball on each quiz. I learned a lot, though not sure my grade will reflect it. Either ya like her or hate her. Worth a shot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2004<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst Teacher i have had at any level of my education career, i wish i would have dropped this class. But i did get an A in the class and didn't do anything. If you feel like sitting through the worst 10 weeks of your life take her.</div></div></div></body></html>
