He's entertaining, engaging, understanding etc. Even outside of class Barry is helpful, patient and just a great human being. Bad days at DePaul are made better by attending his class.

Being his student makes me want to learn!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2008<br>Class Name: HIST101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the most informative, chill, fun, person I have met in a long time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2007<br>Class Name: THE204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly, I could sit and listen to Barry Brunetti talk about anything in the world for hours and be completely engaged and interested the whole time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2006<br>Class Name: HDL201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So funny!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2006<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ok so i took him for my first-year discover performance class... but he is awesome. really nice, really helpful, really laidback, really fun. i didn't expect to learn much from this class, but i actually learned a lot, and it wasn't stressful at all. loved the class, loved him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/10/2006<br>Class Name: HDLLIFE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teachers I have ever taken at any level of education.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2006<br>Class Name: HDL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Barry cares about each individual student, and will go out of his way to help you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2006<br>Class Name: STAGEDIRECTION<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher!

For somehow we always get off the topic but somehow relate it back to what we were originally talking about. His dry humor is hilarious and you can tell that he likes teaching. He is very very very approachable and will learn your name.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2005<br>Class Name: HDL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Barry was one of the best teachers I had while at DePaul.

He is one of the smartest ppl i've met and his attitude, knowledge, and style of teaching are perfect for history of dramatic lit. Class often feels like a waste of time but Barry knows it is. When Barry talks everyone else that speaks after him just sounds stupid, that's how smart Barry is.</div></div></div></body></html>
