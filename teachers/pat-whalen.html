Guest speakers were are real plus also.  Students complained about her test but she gave advance notice it would be right from the textbook.  She made the class really interesting, was clearly an expert in her field, and a very reasonable grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2010<br>Class Name: PRAD377<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Whalen never stops talking. She will get off on so many tangents about her past jobs, blah blah blah. It's so hard to sit there and listen to her. She also expects a lot more from her students then she explains. She grades a lot differently than you would expect. There were 4 quizzes, 1 individual paper, 2 group papers, & final presentation+binder.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2008<br>Class Name: CMN255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her quizes are hard but she gave SO MANY extra credit opportunities, it was amazing and if people got bad grades it was totally their fault for not doing easy discussion guides. If a lot of people didnt show up she would give more extra credit. 4 Quizes, Final Exam, and Group project and if you actually go to class everything will be easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2008<br>Class Name: CMN391<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A really easy discussion guide is due each class (counts as homework and doubles as attendance). Midterm, NO final. Awesome group project with actual clients leading up to a big pitch at the end of the semester. Whichever group is picked as the best gets an automatic &quot;A&quot;. Loved this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2007<br>Class Name: CMN255<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the worst. Beware! She simply does not know how to teach.  She went off on tangents, made simple ideas complex, and had completely unclear expectations. Her TA seemed to know more than she did. That tells you a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2007<br>Class Name: CMN255<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She knows her stuff, and she's been around.. but she doesn't know how to teach for anything.  Everything is so boring, and the tests are pretty awful.  At one point she said &quot;I won't try to trick you on this test&quot;, yet on the test, there were many trick questions. At least she admitted they were as such after.  You'll probably get a B..most did</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2006<br>Class Name: CMN255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good class. Maybe the person who had a problem with her couldn't take the fact that she uses correct English. It's &quot;TAUGHT&quot; not &quot;TEACHED.&quot; Pick up a book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2006<br>Class Name: CMN255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good quality teacher. A lot of reading, but unnecessary to do it all.. only needed to skim, read summaries, and show up to class regularly. There were not two HUGE projects. There was one short paper and a group presentation. The people who showed up to class knew how to do them because she explained thoroughly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2006<br>Class Name: CMN233<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was sometimes a tough grader but she has a lot of experience and really knows her stuff. She's also a really nice woman, and was understanding about absences and even gave us a really good curve on the midterm. I don't think she expected anything unreasonable and I actually ended up getting a better grade than I expected. I'd take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2006<br>Class Name: CMN255<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DEAR LORD! she teached STRAIGHT from the book, you have about 40 pages to read EVERY night and she has only taught Graduate classes up until now so you're tests are pretty much impossible. Save yourself the boredom and stress and DO NOT take her...not to mention she gives you two huge project and about a sentence explaining how to do it!</div></div></div></body></html>
