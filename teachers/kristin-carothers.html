I'd say abnormal psych was a fun class tho.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2010<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A Kind Person but a HORRIBLE Teacher. She is disorganized and does not know the material. She didn't know where the cerebellum was. She also has her TA grade all the Reflections and mostly on Grammar rather than content. I would not take her class if you'd actually like to learn something.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2009<br>Class Name: PSYCH353<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Usually the first people who leave comments on here are the people have have been upset with the prof. I am definitely not a straight A student and was able to attain an A-. Midterm, final, & 5 1pg reflections + ex cr. I learned a lot about abnormal psychology. She's very knowledgeable. Some Depaul students seemed to have racial tensions in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2009<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Okay, she is not nearly as bad as everyone says she is. She is NOT a shame on Depaul. She is a nice and understanding person who just wasn't cut out to be a professor. If you can, don't take her. If you have to make sure to read everything she assigns or you will fail. Lectures are mandatory and do not help to supplement assign readings.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2009<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked her as a person, but I don't think she was cut out to be an instructor. Class is mandatory & you will lose points if you don't attend class. However, class was pointless and it didn't help supplement the material. If you take her READ or you will fail. She is not a mean person and is understanding to situations.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2009<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>probbly the worst teacher ive had at depaul. didnt seem to know anything. i thought she was new and she had an excuse for how disorganized she was...but she taught this class before! the whole class was frustrated with her. i would definitely not recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2009<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think she gets confused when she teaches but the class is full of idiots and people who ask stupid questions so I cant blame her. Not a great professor, and sometimes class can be really hard to sit through but she tries. She does work with students and doesn't grade too hard. Attendance is mandatory. Overall, she's pretty decent at best</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2009<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her presence at DePaul is a tragedy to the institution. It infuriates me that I waste $300 a week to be read to from the book, and to have useless (and often incorrect)information spewed at me, in a condescending, infuriating manner. Only take if you want to develop an anxiety disorder. Decent person. Horrible professor. Waste of time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2009<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE HER. abnormal psy is the class most ppl look forward to the most in the psych department. dont let her ruin it for you too. the chick has no clue what shes blabbing about.</div></div></div></body></html>
