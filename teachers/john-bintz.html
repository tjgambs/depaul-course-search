Bintz went over powerpoints that he posted on D2L. Welcomed in class discussion. No homework given, just a solo project and small group project. As mentioned, do write down the little odd stuff he says as it can be on his tests. Would certainly recommend him, great instructor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2013<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Suuuper easy class. He flies through the lectures, but everything is online, so it doesn't matter. Write down the random things he says during class instead of lecture notes, those will be on quiz and you can look at lecture notes online anyway. Really nice guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2013<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super easy class. No homework or textbook necessary. 3-page executive summary, 2-page group paper + presentation, midterm, and final. Typically lets you out of class an hour and a half early. Lots of real-world examples, very knowledgeable. Take this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2013<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. He is much more concerned with the students actually learning something useful than straight memorization of abstract ideas. He has real life experience to share and brings in many guest lecturers to share their thoughts and ideas. This was one of the most enjoyable classes I had. When you enjoy the class, you always pick up more.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2012<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Bintz was great! Midterm and Final are 100% verbatim from the in-class lectures and guest speakers. Don't have to buy the text book. Overall, this was a very helpful class and I would highly recommend taking him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2012<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>excellent professor, teaches from slides but more from personal wisdom and guest speakers.

You don't need the textbook for this class just study his powerpoints and take notes on the guest lecturers he brings in. Easy to get a B but you can get an A if you study for the midterm and final. Very easy grader on the assignment and presentation we had to do for the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2012<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took him over the DEC intercession. Teaches from powerpoint slides, but supplements them with his own wisdom. No book required. He brought in guest speakers, which supplemented the teachings. Tests were straightforward. His simplistic teaching style enabled me to learn a lot from the class. He's my favorite professor from college. Easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2012<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor and guy. Not an academic, but you learn lots of real world material in his class.  Exams of from powerpoint slides.  He doesn't make you buy a book.  YOU MUST STUDY THE POWERPOINT SLIDES.  Very easy but time consuming like a spelling B. Lets the class grade some work.  Everyone will get an A becuse of it.  Would take him agian.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2012<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor! I took this class during winter intersession as a night class he let us out early every day. Don't buy the book. He covers everything in his lectures through powerpoint slides. He's a successful business man, great person to network. He also brings in speakers to class. Not a boring class, few assignments overall great class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2011<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor. I took him during intercession and never used the book. Everything he says is what is on his exams and the assignments are a breeze all you have to do is put forth SOME effort. He has great guest speakers and class never went to the time it was scheduled. He's to the point and efficient.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2011<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super easy and helpful.

His grading style is very easy and doesn't require the textbook. He also really cares about his students and just wants to know that you learned something. Everything you need to know is covered in class and through his powerpoints.Took it as a night class and got out at least an hour early every night.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2011<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a great professor!
