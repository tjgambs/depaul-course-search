DON'T BE FOOLED. He's condescending and when you ask a question he will act like you're stupid. There's no required homework and a math class is the only class that should have that. He'll flat out say "you understand? No? Of course you don't" Very rude!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2014<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take this professor. He is a horrible teacher. He gets easily frustrated when you ask him a question or to take a moment to clarify. I seriously learned more from the college student math tutors than him. He makes you pay almost $110 for the online HW access code plus the really expensive depaul book ($100-180). Believe me, do not take him. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2014<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div> The material he presents consists of book examples or one he makes up on the spot.   Without prepared lecture notes, this produces many algebra mistakes. Doing the homework doesn't help for his exams. They consist of material that hasn't been covered since basic algebra, like  (x-y)^3(x-y)(x^2+xy+y^2), only you will have to integrate this.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2014<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His accent is hard to understand, he is a nice guy but cannot teach math to someone who doesn't know math very well.

Definitely a teacher for higher thinkers. I felt bad for the kids that weren't good at math, though. If you are good at math, take him. I got a 100% in the class and didn't do an ounce of homework.

He comes off as a nice guy at first, joking and letting you out of class early. He dodges questions with rude comments. You insult him if you don't know something.

However, if you need everything clearly explained, he's not your guy. He's not good at helping you understand the material - which is very difficult.
