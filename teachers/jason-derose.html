I wondered why I even bother showing up oh yeah reading quizes everyday.  His quizzes are unrealistic he wants you to fill in the blank from exact quotes, cmon 100 pages of reading ask me about the context not direct quotes.  Does he have a teaching degree&#63;  I am beginning to wonder.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2006<br>Class Name: REL224<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is realy, really hard. He expects us to read 100 pages a week of really hard stuff like Augustine and Calvin and then he gives us quizes. He think a C is a good grade on a paper. He alwasy wants us to discuss but won't tell us what he wants us to say in the papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2006<br>Class Name: REL224<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's very demanding. A hard grader. But the material is interesting and he's a good lecturer. He seems to think he's funny. But he's not.</div></div></div></body></html>
