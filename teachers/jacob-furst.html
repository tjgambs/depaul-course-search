Not entirely sure what I'm suppose to be doing, though. There's no textbook; he posts articles then asks a vague question for discussion, which there is none of because it's unclear whether we're suppose to respond to each other. I don't understand the point of this class. Waste of money.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2012<br>Class Name: GAM224<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jacob's lectures were interesting because he is really into it. He plays video games just like us and he is very engaged whenever you tell him a game that he has not heard/played before.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2011<br>Class Name: GAM244<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a really nice teacher. His lectures were kind of boring sometimes, but they were important. There is no text book. When ever I got stuck he was always able to help within a few days. Tries to keep class interesting. Good class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2010<br>Class Name: GAM224<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice, and helpful. He jokes around with the class but definitely knows the material and is passionate about video games, which makes the class much better.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2008<br>Class Name: CNS378<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Furst uses weekly articles as opposed to having a normal textbook.  As long as you are involved in class (do the work), you will get an A.  One of DePaul's true gems.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2008<br>Class Name: CSC239<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nicest teacher ever, very helpful, not too difficult to get an A, great science la&s requirement for business majors.

I didn't get an A because of my own lack of paying attention in class. The homework and final can be done by studying the book and going to class occasionally.

The lectures are long but the lab time really makes the class very clear.
