You will be missing out if you don't take a class with him. I have never had a more fulfilling/rewarding experience at DePaul, nor a more brilliant professor. Everything he says is pure gold. I wish I could take him again, but alas, I am graduating in a few months.

His class was fascinating, and I always left with my head spinning from all the amazing things he taught us. He is not only intelligent, but he is accessible and unbelievably kind.

One of those profs who was born to be a professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2013<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An INCREDIBLE intellect combined with a great sense of humor! Be prepared to read quite a bit; however, he takes a difficult subject and makes it as easily understandable as humanly possible. His lectures are jam-packed with facts and concepts yet entertaining at the same time. Do NOT pass up the opportunity to take his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2013<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man is the greatest professor/teacher that I have had in all my years of school!
