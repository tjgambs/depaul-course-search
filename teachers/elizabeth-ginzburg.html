You must have some prior Russian experience and get ready to read, because it is a literature class. Homework is usually the same (vocabulary + reading questions for discussion). If don't do your work, she will know and remember it for the rest of the quarter. Easy A, if you show interest! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2014<br>Class Name: RUS318<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2012<br>Class Name: RUS104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Belittling, disrespectful, and simply confusing. She will announce your grades in class, is strongly opposed to questions, has no class structure, and uses the most bizarre grading system. I am mostly upset about how little I progressed with my Russian. Am not continuing with 105 because of Ginzburg, and I absolutely love Russian.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2012<br>Class Name: RUS104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor I have ever taken. She is rude, doesn't like questions, and focused more on memorizing songs and poems than teaching us the Russian language. I love Russian, but I will not be taking any more classes since she is the only teacher for the next sequences.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2011<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT BUY THE BOOKS FOR THIS FOCAL POINT.

Take if you want an easy A but a headache after class. Prof. Ginzburg YELLS during class but she is genuinely a nice person and can be very funny. I dreaded coming to class but attendace is mandatory and she really tries to give everyone an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2010<br>Class Name: ENG389<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I Loved her class!Learned a lot.Don't miss classes if you want to succeed.

As long as you are ready for discussion (and she does call on everyone) the class is pretty fun. She does tend to interrupt sometimes, but it's not too bad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2006<br>Class Name: RUS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really like this professor.

DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS. SHE IS NOT A GOOD TEACHER, AND NOT NICE IN PERSON</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2005<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dude, this teacher is unbelievable! Interrupts students when they are actually answering or present something. Very annoying. Thinks she knows everything. Class is kinda easy(Russian Culture), but she will give u a headache :(</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2005<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely unclear in terms of what she wants from students. Has a habit of interrupting students with long digressions in the middle of presentations. ISP 102 (Russian Culture), however, is not difficult. With participation, homework and regular attendance, success is guaranteed.</div></div></div></body></html>
