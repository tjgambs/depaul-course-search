No textbook required. Gives you nothing but material that will be on tests. No time wasted. Lectures from start to end and sometimes a few minutes later. Very long and hard to sit through at times. No breaks either. He is great in that he gives you nothing but the important material. A little goofy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2015<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Not too bad! You DO NOT need the book. Only grades are midterm (40%) and final (60%), both are which are tests, all multiple choice. The practice tests are IDENTICAL to the tests, just different scenarios. Epstein loves Econ, though his lectures get boring. Absences don't matter but he takes attendance in case you are between grades. Great person.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2015<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Least favorite professor I've ever had at DePaul. Lectures are boring and confusing, he assumes you already know everything about economics, and the grade is just based off of the midterm and the final. No participation, no homework, no quizzes. Sounds like a dream but actually just screws you over big time. Not accessible to students for help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2014<br>Class Name: ECO305<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>There are two tests. Midterm and Cumulative Final. Funny guy, but I could see why some would not like his lecturing style due to political tangents. Pretty low class average for the final, and there is a lot of note taking needed. No homework aside from problems he gives you to assist you in studying. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2014<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would not take a class with him as my professor again. He doesn't provide readings or any homework- so you think it would be an easy class...but come midterm and final time and it screws you over. Doesn't have office hours.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2014<br>Class Name: ECON305<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good lecturer. What he says and puts as homework on the board usually was on the exams.  Doesn't like to spend time with students outside of class.  Not really an "above and beyond professor." Not the kind of professor you'd want if you're someone who seeks more attention and help.  Really bummed me out on becoming an Econ major.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Difficult subject matter and Dr. Epstein moves through it quickly. All the test questions come from lectures-NO NEED for the book.Very difficult and harsh grader and the tests are not multiple choice. He gives no answers for the homework and that could be very frustrating. I feel I should have received and A but instead received a B+. ruined my GPA</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/31/2013<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is a bit difficult for a 100-level class. Topics move by very quickly. Epstein is very knowledgeable toward current events. And so he requires about 7-8 blog entries throughout the quarter. A 5mn news presentation is a must for everyone. Midterm and Final are multiple choice but a bit tricky. Say you're from MN and you should start good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2012<br>Class Name: ECO305<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dude is pretty legit. His class isn't hard at all. You dont' need the book because his exams are all based from the stuff he teaches in class. Take good notes, pay attention, and brush up on your calculus (differential equations) if need be. Overall, the guy is mad legit.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2012<br>Class Name: ECO305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He may seem hard and literally insane.

He teaches with personality and a lot of energy. Most of the time, he's yelling to make a point, but he keeps you interested. He also loves to discuss topics and real life economics problems outside of class. Very cool guy, very pragmatic</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2011<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Average teacher, lectures consist of rewriting his notes on the white board.  Grading is a bit erratic but averages out ended up getting a better final grade than I thought I would get going into the final.  He has a dry sense of humor which kept things somewhat entertaining. If math isn't your thing it will take a lot of out of class studying.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2011<br>Class Name: ECO305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a good Prof.  Gives HW with no solutions.

The class is hard. It is mathematically challenging. BUT, if you work hard, go to his office to ask questions and go over the homework, you'll be fine!! Not an easy class by any means but not impossible to get an A either.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2011<br>Class Name: ECO305<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Difficult class. Do not buy the textbook. I did, but we never used it. Epstein is a challenging professor. If you're looking for an easy A, then don't take him. You really need to work outside of class and set meetings to discuss the hw. In the end, I learned quite a bit.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2011<br>Class Name: ECO305<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you're good at teaching yourself and are well-versed in the mathematical principles of economics, you'll be fine.

Midterms 25% each final 50%. He goes through the work quickly and is scattered when teaching. 5 questions on midterm takes 1 1/2 hrs to complete.

Two midterms, each 25% of your grade, and the final (comprehensive) is worth 50%. Don't buy the book</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2010<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the most disorganized professors I have ever had. He teaches off notes he wrote decades earlier. He randomly gives a homework problem here and there throughout class. He never bothered to think to print out there sheets ahead of time. He grades harshly as well. His clarity leaves much to be desired. I would never take a class from him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2010<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Epstein is hilarious.

If you attend class, take good notes, and do the problems he assigns, you'll do fine. He told us a handful of exam questions, word for word. No surprises.

He had a tendency to mumble and trail off at the end of sentences sometimes, but that's my only complaint.  He explained the material clearly and was willing to answer any questions that were asked.

He really knows the material, and does a great job of simplifying complex concepts to make them easier to understand.

On a personal level, Seth has a great way of lightening the content, and making it entertaining.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing Professor.  I didn't think it would be possible to make Calculus & Statistics very exciting but he found a way to do it.  He found subtle ways to teach the fundamentals of the course along with tying applications to the theory.  If you are good at math, you'll love his passion and work.  If you are not good at math, you're head may spin.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2008<br>Class Name: ECON555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lot of material to cover & Professor keeps a quick pace.

Sometimes makes fun of people for asking questions.  Doesn't go over homework so partner with someone to help you. Textbook isn't that helpful. Tests are mainly off homework.  He does let you out early, but there is no break. He doesn't use blackboard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2007<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very bad experience.  He knows the material but often lectures to the board and mumbles things to himself.  Doe not use Blackboard nor does his syllabus provide much useful information. Tests are challenging and based entirely on the lectures. Forget the book.  Probably a brilliant researcher but one of the worst prof at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2007<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As a journalism undergraduate, I didn't know much about Economics. Epstein actually takes the time to go through the concepts step by step. You must attend class. Forget about the book. Don't be afraid to ask questions or stop by afterwards. You must put an effort into this class, but it's clear what you need to know for the tests.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2007<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The guy made economics pretty interesting and theres only 2 midterms and a final. Gives practice exams a week before each one and the final is a bunch of questions from the 1st 2 exams. 90% of the test content comes from class notes so its real easy if u attend class.all around woulda gotten an A if i studied more for the 1st test</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2007<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgeable about Econ. Some material is highly technical, but aids in understanding the concepts, which I used a LOT in later classes. The format is standard: homework, midterm, final. You need to be in class each week, take notes & copy charts/graphs from board, and you'll need to know how & why things work. Overall, better than average.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2007<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not the worst professor ever, but is definitely not my favorite. He at least speaks clear English at least which is hard to come by at DePaul. He doesn't explain the material very well and buying the book is practically a waste of 100 dollars.
