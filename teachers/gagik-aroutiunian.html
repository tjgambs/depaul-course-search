It's almost all discussion based, so if you want a good grade you HAVE to talk. Papers are short and he is an easy grader. He doesn't make you buy any books. The only negative is that he is very strict on attendance.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2014<br>Class Name: HON205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Aroutiunian is a great guy! He's genuinely friendly and always willing to help students in any way that he can. He is truly passionate about performance art and has made me appreciate and understand art at a new and more sophisticated level. Although the class involves a lot of wirtten work, it is not difficult if you put in the time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2012<br>Class Name: ART115<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Aroutiunian is a really nice guy. He really wants to help his students, sometimes a little too much though. There is a lot of writing involved, such as a page paper for each project and like 40 artist summaries due at the end of the quarter. All in all, not at awful class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2012<br>Class Name: ART115<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is great! Do most work, which  happens to be easy and fun, and you're guaranteed an A. He's really nice too. He let us have 1 break each class to go buy some food or just to relax.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2011<br>Class Name: ART113<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am studying to be an art teacher, and in my opinion Gagik is the best professor I have ever had.  A genius artist, a good person, and a surprisingly patient man.  I truly hope his work and teaching abilities can be experienced by artists and learners alike for much time to come.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2011<br>Class Name: ART115<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Eh... Decent professor. Managed to make Scuplture class more of a drag than fun. Helpful at times, but tough attendance and grading. If you enjoy sculpture, you'll be fine, just show up to class and follow assignment guidelines</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2011<br>Class Name: HON205<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Body and Performance....where to begin.  Firstly, and in my opinion most importantly, his attendance policy is BRTUAL.  An unexcused absence results in a letter grade drop for the quarter, 3 lates equate to the same. Also, expects you to go to the Library to read for every single class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2011<br>Class Name: ART113<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Prof. Aroutiunian He pushes his students to create interesting and quality work. He is extremely helpful whenever you need him. I love that he incorporates art history within his art classes.. Those who disliked this professor were probably not interested in the subject in the first place.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2009<br>Class Name: ART104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class as a night class. Wasn't too bad, just long (let us out early though, every time). He grades based on whether or not he likes it, which can be rough. Pay attention to what he emphasizes that art should have and emulate that, and you'll do fine in the class. The final includes writing a 6-page paper. I got an A in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2008<br>Class Name: ART115<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is more writing in this class then there should be; 5 page final paper, one to two page paper for each project, and one paragraph for about forty artists, it's not terrible but still more than what you would expect from a begininng art class. He is funny, but not because he tries. His talks can go long, but he knows what he is talking about.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2006<br>Class Name: ART115<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ohhhhhhh my lord. i have a tolerance for lectures, but my GOD, this man DOES NOT STOP. It goes beyond informing and becomes so mind numbingly normal that you start to nod out uncontrollably.  I know that there is a language barrier but this man needs to learn how to convey his thoughts with fewer words.  Simple explanations take hours.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2006<br>Class Name: BEGSCULPTURE<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2005<br>Class Name: ART115<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hated this class. He acts cool, but it a tuff grader, and hard to understand. You have to work at least 3-6 hours out side of class to get the projects done on time. He has a very different idea of what art is. Unless you are going into sculpture as your major do not take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2005<br>Class Name: BEGSCULPTURE<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gagik is incredibly helpful in making crits interesting and actually worthwhile, so he doesn't like everyones work, he is honest and helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2005<br>Class Name: ART113<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know what these other students are talking about.  I thought he was a pretty decent professor... I have had worst.  I was very proud of my artwork from this class.  The only thing is that he might give you too much independence on your assignments, when you really need more guidance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2005<br>Class Name: 3DART<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>not a fun class, tried to tell you what he wanted your project to look like, so boring with his lectures, they went on forever.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2004<br>Class Name: ART<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's like a real teacher. gives back what you put in. A pleasure to be given a non american perspective. successful in his own right as an artist which is convincing</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2004<br>Class Name: ART113<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gagik says he wants to encourage a personal artistic vision, but I saw little of that actually happening.  Rather, if you didn't do it, bad grade.  During my personal critique, he was condescending and tried to act like my advisor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2004<br>Class Name: BEGSCULP<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing Prof.  He was always there to give advice and help develop your ideas into a wonderful artwork.  Some of my best work was done in his class.  The only suggestion is he cares more about the idea than the art!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/12/2004<br>Class Name: ART1133D<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I listened to everything he told me to do, ways to improve my projects, I put in the extra time but he still gave me C's on most my work.  He accused me of forging my final paper and gave me a C- in the class.  I appealed to the board and won, got a B</div></div></div></body></html>
