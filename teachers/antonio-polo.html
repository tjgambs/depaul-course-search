He is extremely knowledgeable about the subject. Interesting lectures and straightforward expectations. Professional, friendly,understanding, and interesting. If you take a class with Dr. Polo you will not only learn a lot, you will most likely gain more interest in the subject!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2010<br>Class Name: PSY366<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I like this guy. He's got a lot of good qualities (both for a person and for a professor), but they aren't in-your-face good. They're subtle. I imagine, for that reason, most people would think him a mere average professor. If you think about it though, dude's much better than average. Recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/20/2008<br>Class Name: PSY3XX<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2008<br>Class Name: PSY366<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At first, he will seem sort of boring, even quiet. But as the quarter progressed, he opened up and he became a great professor. He is really understanding and knowledgeable. Sort of adorable too :)</div></div></div></body></html>
