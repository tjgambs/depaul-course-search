Also (wrongly) accused my friend of plagiarizing a one-page paper.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2006<br>Class Name: ART101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really nice and very helpful. I liked the way she arranged the class, so that you are not overwhelmed.  She is flexible, easy-going, and understanding. I do recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: DESIGNINCHI<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is my easiest class by far. She explains assignments in really specific detail, and doesn't give a ton of homework. I usually wrote my papers on Sun. night @ 10pm and was always done b4 midnight. She's a really quiet, but really nice and understanding person.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: ART104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At first i thought her projects were kind of nuts, because she drew out extensive ways to come up with an idea for a project, but it turns out that she just wants you to stick with your ideas.  SHe's pretty quiet when she talks, which kinda makes you want to nap.  Watch out for her attendance policies though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2005<br>Class Name: ART105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a really sweet, flexible, easy-going, easy-grading, supportive teacher. The downside is she doesn't push you at all. You can get an easy A by doing the bare minimum. Her class was relaxing to say the least.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2005<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very soft spoken but a good teacher!  She also has pretty boring ways of 'having fun'.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2005<br>Class Name: DESIGN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Jennifer for a large portion of my design coursework.  I absolutely loved her!  She  has wonderful harmony with her students and is easily approachable.  I learned so much from her classes, just have to stick it out through those lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2005<br>Class Name: ART105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jennifer is really nice, and she's a pretty lenient grader - even if you haven't taken an art class in years (like me) you still have a good chance of doing well, so long as you work hard. It can seem like a lot of work at times but she's really helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2005<br>Class Name: ART105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a sweetheart. She's really nice and makes class a joy to come to for 6 hours a week. I'm a girl and I think she's a hottie</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2005<br>Class Name: BEGDRAWING<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jen is such a cool lady. She is very helpful and is always clear in what she wants and expects from you. If you're not too experience in the field, she is definitely a good teacher to take. And if you are experienced, she is also good. Professor Jen really cares about her students.. very recomended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2004<br>Class Name: DESIGNCLASSES<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The people who gave her bad ratings are crazy! Jennifer is a wonderful professor and incredibly helpful as well. I took a couple of classes with her and have some great pieces for my portfolio because of it. Definetly take her classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2004<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is good for students new to art. Apparently it sucks if you are very good at art. You have to take this class to take other art classes. She does not tell you the materials you need and you spend a lot of $. 4 main projects, and activites, 2 tests. In general, a very decent professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2004<br>Class Name: DESIGN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2004<br>Class Name: DESIGN<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I absolutely hated her. she is so boring and never comes to class prepared. she is one of the worst teachers i've ever had. don't ever take a class from her you will regret it. she is so boring and really soft spoken so you can't hear what she is saying.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/19/2004<br>Class Name: ART101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>can be a little boring during lectures, but is really helpful and seems to really enjoy teaching and working with her students - not a bad choice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2004<br>Class Name: ART101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you show interest she will like you. if you know what you are doing, and show that you have prior experience, she will grade you to that level (harder).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2004<br>Class Name: DESIGN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She can be demanding as far as the work loadand can be boring. She is always willing to help and is not that tough of a grader.  If you get to know her and actually show interest in the subject you'll find out she's very helpful and knows her stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2004<br>Class Name: ART227<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Likes and rewards the lazy weirdos who can BS their way through assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2003<br>Class Name: ART<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
