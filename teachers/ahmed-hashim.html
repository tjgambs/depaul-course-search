There are two texts that are required for the readings. Also, expect quizzes every week, which is based on the lecture, but not from the books. Participation matters including the weekly reflection paper. As long as you're engaged in class, you'll be fine. However, his lecture is dry.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/15/2015<br>Class Name: 201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>not so many tests but weekly readingsreports on them. VERY nice guy but does not have what it takes to instruct-its not for em. NEVER ask him to repeat himself. He will make a fool out of you. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2014<br>Class Name: IWS217<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Hashim wants you to learn and change your assumptions on Islam. He expects you to read and participate, which is contingent of passing the course, like any other. If you are lazy, he takes it personally. If you're having trouble, reach out to him, he will help you! He is a soft-spoken, kind gentleman. Be good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/29/2014<br>Class Name: IWS217<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm not a REL or IWS major. I took this class out of genuine curiosity and interest in the topic. There are no prerequisites for this class. However, he taught as if we were supposed to have knowledge about Islam, Middle Eastern history & Arabic. Not understanding towards students who didn't. I will never take his classes again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/17/2013<br>Class Name: IWS192<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Hashim is a very intelligent professor. He definitely knows what hes talking about. If students do the readings, they should be fine. He has a dry sense of humor, and he is always willing to help. Overall great professor. Learned a lot in his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2012<br>Class Name: IWS263<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Participation(15%)Midterm(20%) Paper(30%)Final(25%) He is a really nice and smart guy. He doesn't get that the reading is very dense, so when he learns that students aren't keeping up with the readings, he gets upset. Take notes during the lectures (especially if you don't do the readings like me!)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/15/2010<br>Class Name: HST142<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful guy. Took him for a Muslim History class. Reading helps alot, and if you are at all interested in the material you will do well on quizzes and tests. Very helpful, lenient. As a class, we got to watch Kingdom of Heaven which was nice. Takes his job seriously, but still managed to crack me up with his jokes. Definitely recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/29/2009<br>Class Name: IWS116<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He changes the format for the exams depending on the students' desire.

I learned a lot from his class. He is very passionate about the subject and he really knows what he's talking about. Don't worry about the other comments, they are lazy students who don't even participate in class or take advantage of the %20 attend. & Partic. grade!

Lots of boring material. Many pop quizzes that cover material no covered or only briefly covered in class. Grades like a prick. The AVG grade on his mid term was like 55%.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2009<br>Class Name: HIST142<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Hashim is very nice and funny.  But, his he has taught this class as if we should already know what he is teaching.  Too much reading, too many quizzes, too much everything for an entry level class.  He is not clear at all on the assignments he gives, and his quizzes are over topics barley  or not covered at all or read about in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2008<br>Class Name: REL116<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Hashim is a great professor. I learned a lot from his class. I think that people take advantage of his kindness. Very good and i am willing to take the class again. A tip: you watch Arab comedians during class time.
