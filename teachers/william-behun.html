He is so interesting and helpful! you writea big essay but he's really open to whatever you want to write about, and he is lenient with extensions.

His lectures were interesting and he made you feel comfotable participating.  The class was fairly easy, reading material was a little difficult but his lectures usually clarify concepts.

His class was very thought provoking. He may be arrogant like one person said, but I think he has a right to be because he knows Greek and German and has a book getting published. He is also very available for help outside of class and will proofread rough drafts which is awesome.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2006<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dont believe the hype! This professor Sucks. He is arrogant and a total Jerk. Hes hard and too stuck on himself to see past his own deception.

Not a difficult class, but WOW did I really learn a lot!

He is knowledgeable and loves his job.  Weekly thought memos are easy 1 page papers.  Other than that there is a repsonse paper (4-6) pages on a reading of your choice.  And a final paper.  His lectures are not boring at all.  He likes beer too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2006<br>Class Name: FOCALPOINT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Behun was one of the best professors I have ever had!

He relates everything to modern day stuff so you can understand it. There isn't a lot of class work just a weekly &quot;Thought Memo&quot; in addition to 1 Response Paper and the Final paper. I can't wait to take another class of his....definitely take him!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2005<br>Class Name: FOCALPOINT<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This prof was fun and sarcastic (in a good way =).

I have taken him twice and he makes his classes fun and interesting.  As long as you go to class (he definately takes attendance) and do your thought memos you are sure to at least get a B.  I would strongly recomend that you take his classes.  He is an asset to the school.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Behun will def intimidate you at first with his bald head and accent but after a couple classes he is sure to become one of your favorite teachers at DePaul. PHL 100's content is difficult but Behun makes it easy understandable with his crazy stories and discussions. He knows what he is talking about and if you get him as a teacher you are lucky!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man will intimidate you the first day of class, but after that, he is probably one of the best professors at DePaul.  He is confusing, but then so is philosophy.  He will make you think, and work hard to explain everything.  I've always hated philosophy, but he challanged me to think, and to work in the class,and it paid off in the end. Thanks</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2005<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is awesome. Makes you think about topics you normally wouldnt care for. Readings are not too bad, and his discussions are interesting. Doesnt bore you to death, but makes you think about cool stuff.

His lectures are sometimes very interesting but he does talk a lot and it could be shortened but it's not that bad.  The papers are very easy and very light.

Thorough lectures that illuminate the reading material.  Funny and approachable.  Only problem I have is that I have no clue what grade I am getting in the class.
