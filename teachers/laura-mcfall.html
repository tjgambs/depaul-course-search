The lecture was supposed to be 3 hours long but she only lectured 1. If you don't care much about the topic it will be good for you, but if you wanna get for what you paid (actually learn something by being challenged), I wouldn't recomend her. I had to drop this class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2014<br>Class Name: TDC411<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is making learning fun.

The class seems to stretch on though, as the concepts are already covered by week 5 / 10. Good professor, albeit easy, but the class should just be shorter. Take online if possible.

I would highly recommend her. There is no midterm or final exam, however there are lots of small assignments but they are fairly straightforward. There are four labs and a final project, but again, very straightforward. She will answer all questions and takes time to get to explain the material in full detail. Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2012<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely helpful and nice.

Laura Mcfalll is one of the teachers who come to class and passionately talks about the subject. She does assign a lot of writing so make sure to expect that from her. She cares about her students and treats them like her own family.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2010<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easiest class EVER.

I got an A+ easily in the class. A ton of group work, but you can also chose to work individually. No due dates for anything, just by the end of the quarter. Very hands-on, DIY style so you actually learn stuff by doing it. No midterm, no final. she's awesome.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/27/2010<br>Class Name: TDC311<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take her if you have other classes to take! She assigns 3 main assignments the 1st day that are due at the end of the quarter. On top of that, she keeps assigning more assignments per week. Like her class is the only call we are taking. STAY AWAY!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2009<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great prof!

I took her night class from 6-9 and we were done with the lecture at 7:30 and could stay to work on assignments with her help or we could leave so it was very accomodating.
