She comes to class late(15 minutes),she doesnt take interest in the class.Dont participate in discussion-she'll give you this face like your crazy. Quizzes are easy as long as you read the chapter.

Work load was super easy just read the chapter, have her talk about it in class, and then take a quiz on the chapter. It seems super easy but she never returns emails or phone calls, gives little description on the final, and does not give back or discuss the final paper or essay exams.

I am a sociology major and love the subject matter, yet this professor made me want to pull my hair out during the quarter. She is disorganized and incomprehensible. Don't expect to understand a thing she says! Seriously!

When people in the class ask her if she will answer a question for them she flat out told them no. She rambled about things that had nothing to do with the class and it was unclear what she wanted from out papers and research. I recommend another teacher for this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2009<br>Class Name: SOC380<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I read all the other ratings and I have to say that I really enjoy Bootcheck as a professor. This is the second class that I have taken with her. She is in general a nice lady, can ramble at times yet is very knowledgeable about the topics and a published author. She is actually a sociology professor that does research and has a few published works</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2009<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i have not taken a class with her. However, I have had to help friends with their research methods project because she was too lazy to create the template needed to have an accurate account.

Just lazy overall!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2008<br>Class Name: SOC000<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If I could give anyone the most imporant advice at Depaul is do NOT TAKE HER! Please don't think how I did &quot;how bad can it be&quot;. I regret it. She is the RUDEST, most UNCLEAR prof in all the 5 school i've been to. She literally hates her job. Shes always on the defense and will teach you NOTHING.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2008<br>Class Name: SOC207<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Without ranting and raving, she's a very poor teacher and the quarter with her has been extremely frustrating. Very incoherent, disorganized, somewhat disrespectful, arbitrary grading (you will typically have NO IDEA how she decided your grade) - class is essentially a mess. So I'd recommend avoiding her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2008<br>Class Name: SOC207<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WORST TEACHER EVER! I'm taking her right now & I can't stand her. She is SO RUDE & DISRESPECTFUL! She INSULTS THE WHOLE CLASS! She throws papers around and has a horrible attitude. She never talks about the topic and doesnt engage students. She shuts you down when you ask a question. Does explain her grading, tells class our work is crap & swears!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2007<br>Class Name: SOC105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>um...this teacher is very F*ed up.....i think she comes to class stoned or ****....stay far....far away.....</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2007<br>Class Name: SOC107<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Craziest lady ever, but in a good way. Probably the easiest class I have ever taken. Just read the chapters and daily quizes are so easy. If you want to be a soc major do not take because she will not in anyway talk about anything relavent to what you are learning. No final just an easy project.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2007<br>Class Name: SOC105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is pretty knowledgable about what she teaches, but she's not a very good teacher.  she is not very clear about explaining things and wastes a lot of time going off on tangents.  i would not take a class offered by her again</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2007<br>Class Name: SOC326<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed this professor...although her class lectures often have nothing to do with the topic of the class, she is a very interesting woman and I learned a lot.

Overall she wasn't bad. You have to study for the Midterm and Final and complete all class readings, also attendance isn't mandatory but you will miss important class notes that show up on the tests. She expects hard work out of her students, and I learned a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2006<br>Class Name: SOC107<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I like her a lot. She talked a lot and sometimes really went off on tangents but overall it always just taught you more about life and people in general. She knows a lot, she is well experienced and when you read what she asks you to you do fine on her tests. The multiple choice test every week simply require reading the chapter for an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2006<br>Class Name: SOC105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible! Can't make a declarative/clear sentence to save her life. Gives really hard weekly multiple choice quizzes on the chapters.
