You learn so much and there is a LOT of hands on activity, which I love. You go on a lot of field trips and meet authors. There are a few papers, but mostly reflection. I didn't even read the books and got A's. Totally recommend this class. Meyer is super funny, nice, and knows a lot about the topic.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2013<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was interesting but Karen tends to be rude to her students. Prepared to be called out in front of everyone for doing something wrong. She grades easily and will not accept any late work. She relies on the readings a lot so make sure you read for her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2013<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Makes class pretty interesting. Lots of information. No notes, only 2 books and they are both novels. A few papers, but they are short and mostly reflection. Attendance is pretty mandatory because if you don't go to class you might not be able to write a couple of the papers and she won't help you. Overall it was a great class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/25/2011<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a really easy Professor but her class is totally interesting. You learn a lot whether you pay attention or doze off. Plus she shows you how being disabled isn't the end of the world.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2011<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. Keeps the class interesting and it's easy to relate to the articles she gives. As long as you pay attention in class and do the paper, you'll be fine. I recommend her course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2010<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Karen Meyer was an amazing professor. She definitely was able to relate to everything she taught in the class.

Really easy. Just come to class, dont even really have to pay attention, but its interesting anyways. All reflection papers and she's an easy grader.

Good teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/26/2007<br>Class Name: ISP100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>simply amazing. interesting class you learn alot....honestly! do the papers and you will pass</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2007<br>Class Name: ISP00<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ridiculous amounts of work, must read, cant miss more than one class without getting your grade lowered, and if you fail the final you fail the class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2006<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hated this class. She is rude to her students. 15 page partner research paper as a final. A lot of work and not fun at all!

I wanted the course to be more about Chicago's actual disabled community, but it was more about disabled community in general and Chicago disabled services. Professor Meyer is nice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2006<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>easy teacher. just do the papers and you will get an A easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2005<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Karen Meyer is disabled herself, so you'd think (teaching a disabled class) she'd push her own views/expect you to know every historical detail, but she doesn't. She only wants you to learn, enjoy the class and grow as a student. Who wouldn't want that from their teacher&#63; Two Thumbs Up! Bravo Karen Meyer!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2005<br>Class Name: FOCALPOINT<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think this class was really intersting. Profesor Meyer really is explains everything well, you have to read! Particapte its important and show up for class. The final paper can be challenging depending on what orgazantion you choose to focus on, however, you really do learn a lot from this class in the end. I think its a great class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2005<br>Class Name: FOCALPOINT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, not much work just a short chapter or two for each class which you can skim in order to participate in class.  Final paper is 10 pages but not hard at all.  I'm not usually an A student and I got an A in her class.  I missed 2 classes, never read, and still got an A.  Take this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2005<br>Class Name: FOCALPOINT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great teacher.

She has a lot of compassion on the subject as well. If you do the reading each week (which is not a lot at all!) and pay attention you'll be fine.There are three papers due throughout the qtr, but shes very generous with the grades. TAKE HER CLASS!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2004<br>Class Name: EXPLORE<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>really amazing teacher.
