He is very helpful, he gives you problems with answers that are exactly like quiz and final test problems. Im not very good at math and manged to get a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Just because he talks while he writes on the board doesn't mean he's a bad teacher. He will take time to explain all the questions you might have. He gives homework every week and that really helps with his test. Plus he is fairly easy! I suggest take him@</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2012<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is such an easy teacher. If you think he talks straight to the board then sit in the front. He comes very prepared with great notes. Mandatory homework and weekly quizzes.. but they help make sure you learn the lesson. Overall, I put little effort into it and earned an A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/29/2012<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>straight into the board...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2012<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BEST PROFESSOR EVER!

He does speak into the bored and he goes really fast. He grades really hard and you have quizzes every week that are graded really hard! STAY AWAY FROM HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2011<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All Thomas wants is for his students to understand the material. He didn't try to trick students, which I appreciated. He says on the first day, &quot;If you don't understand, please come talk to me, so you can.&quot;  I would love to take another class from him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2010<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible math professor! he talks straight into the bored and is very quiet. Always unclear about the directions. Would teach and then have a quiz at the end of class on subject we hadn't gone over for two weeks because he was behind. Class was always very rushed. Very boring, and anything I learned, I learned off of MML.</div></div></div></body></html>
