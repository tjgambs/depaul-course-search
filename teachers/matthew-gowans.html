Encourages participation and respects student's opinions. But he assigns tough objective exam questions, so if you do not read all lectures or textbook requirements for exams, get ready to fail. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2015<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Gowans always inspires great class discussions. Sometimes I started to wonder how what he was lecturing about was relevant, but it usually came full circle. There is a lot of assigned reading, so try to keep up. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2015<br>Class Name: REL228602<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is awesome. There is nothing fun about this subject, but he makes you want to pay attention. highly recommend if you have to take REL 228.  You need to buy a $3 book that you use later on in the quarter. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2015<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Papers are really easy if you do the readings, barely any tests. Gowan is a really great teacher. 1010 would recommend </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2015<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this to  knock out a fine arts requirement, so not my area of focus and I thoroughly enjoyed the class. There were only two tests, a few pop quizzes, a paper every once or other week and just a bunch of reading. If you read, you're golden. I also thought Gowans was a great lecturer who encourages and is open to good discussion in class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2015<br>Class Name: REL111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Gowans knows what he is teaching. He makes clear what he wants and expects one to comply. There is a lot of reading and unannounced quizzes, but study and you would be fine. He also makes the class interesting, honest and handles the topic delicately.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2015<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is straightforward.  Two tests and 5 mini 2 page papers.  He checks attendance daily.  Overall its a good class.  He is a nice guy and really seems to care about his students.  Also he makes the course material interesting.  A wide range of topics is covered.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2014<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is boring for lectures. you need to pay attention and write down everything he puts up on the board. has several papers but they are off readings and 2.5 pages long. in order to pass easily you need to do all of the readings</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2014<br>Class Name: REL228222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely one of the best professors DePaul has. He is so extremely helpful and encouraging. He makes you think beyond the class material and apply the knowledge learnt in class in real life. I hated learning about religion prior to his class, but Gowans made it bearable and even fun. Definitely talk to him after class; he is really nice and smart</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2014<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Gowans is a great person. His personal stories actually enhance topics, unlike other professors. The readings are mostly unnecessary. He grades the case reviews and final paper very easily. The midterm and final are simple if you're prepared.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2013<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A great class, only made so by a great professor. This is a very broad topic, and isn't the easiest class ever, it takes critical thinking and analysis. Not insanely hard though. There is a fair amount of outside class reading, around 20-50 pages per day of dense material. Really worth it if one applies themselves.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/02/2013<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a nice guy. Extremely smart and helpful. I almost dropped after the first day because he does not come off as friendly at first, but he warms up quickly! Not an easy A, but you learn quite a bit!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/19/2013<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a bad guy, challenging grader when it comes to papers, yet the study guides/in class reviews provide you with everything to study for the midterm and final. He's rather interesting. Places more emphasis on his own personal experience and lecture versus reading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/31/2013<br>Class Name: REL111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cool, mellow guy. Reading is a bit easy, however, trying to keep each religion in order is a bit difficult. Take notes from everything he writes on the board. Midterm and final were pretty easy, However, make sure he knows your name so that he doesn't mix your grade with a student that rarely shows up to class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Gowans as of now is the best professor i've had at DePaul. He is obviously very into his field and makes every single lecture a very interesting time, although it is a hard topic to keep students focused on. I absolutely recommend his class. I learned so much from him. Extremely nice and understanding. Good luck!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2013<br>Class Name: RELMGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Gowans is easily  the best Professors I have ever encountered. He really cares and enjoys  what he does; knowing the material inside and out doesn't hurt. His teaching style really helps in learning Philosophy and Ethics, and the homework is there to help you to better understand the material.I would recommend everyone take his classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2012<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Gowans is amazing at what he does. He's very knowledgeable. The class is overall a little difficult but that's only if you dont do the readings. Overall he's a great guy who lectures until you understand the concept.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2012<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Instructor Gowans is an amazing teacher! I was not excited at all about having the class and after I saw all the reading we would have to do, I almost bolted. The lectures were the reason I stayed. Instructor Gowans is knowledgeable and passionate about what he teaches and that makes it easy to pay attention. Do the readings and go to class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2011<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an amazing lecturer who takes time to make his classes a comfortable environment encouraging discussion.  Doing all of the readings and/or listening intently in class will guarantee you a great grade; how much effort you put equals your grade in my opinion.  He's been my favorite teacher so far so take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2011<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want an easy A for a boring and lifeless class don't take Prof. Gowans. But, if you want a teacher that actually teaches you something and challenges you to think deeper take him. I think he's a fantastic teacher and I'm so glad I took his class, even if it is harder than most.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2011<br>Class Name: PHI228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you really want to learn Philosophy, then take him. He is very clear when he teaches and the best thing is the way he does will make u remember the stuff very easy and clear. i think he is the best philosophy teacher ever!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2011<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took his business ethics course and it was not bad. He is a nice guy and is very helpful. This course is a lot of reading and is not super easy but he makes it manageable for students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2010<br>Class Name: REL201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a great professor. My entire class loved him. He is clear, devoted to the subject, and motivates you to think deeper. Definitely recommend taking a class of his.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2009<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Matt just started teaching at DePaul. Business Ethics is a tough, tough class to get students enthused about so considering that, he did a really good job. He's a real nice guy with reasonable expectations. I just wished we focused a little more on the environmental aspect of the courses theme. I recommend him for Business Ethics!</div></div></div></body></html>
