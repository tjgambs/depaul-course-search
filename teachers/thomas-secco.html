Hes really crazy about the &quot;outline, rough draft, final draft&quot; thing and recommends that you hand write stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/18/2007<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Secco is a great teacher.
