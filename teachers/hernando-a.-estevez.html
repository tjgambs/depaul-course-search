I met with him for some papers and he really helped.  take it if your willing to put in the time.  reading is manditory but u can skim and get by.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2008<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I learned a lot from him. He was very informative about the readings, but not so much on assignments. I still got an A in the class, but attendance and participation is mandatory.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2007<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Aside from the fact that we got far behind so that by the end of the quarter we ran out of time to go over new material, he did a good job of explaining the different texts of each philosopher we learned about.  He was also helpful and very approachable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2007<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ok...good guy. hates me because i dont try at all. randomly picks on me too. basically READ the stuff so u can write these stupid papers... in all honesty ..take the course pick a different professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is honestly the worst professor I have ever had. I am a Philosophy major and this was the first philosophy esq. class I have taken where i didn't get an A. If you like to know what is going on in class or how you are doing in class don't take him.  Definately plays favorites and does not read your essays. just throws out a grade, this guy is a</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2006<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OMG avoid like the plague.  Very unclear, does not care what students think.  You will just be lost for 10 weeks.  He even goes to the extent of putting students down in front of the class.  Just dont do it.  WORST PROF. AT DEPAUL!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2006<br>Class Name: SCG41163<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He places no value on students opinions or classroom precipitation.  After 10 weeks of journaling and no feed back you think you are on the write track in this class and then you get your grade.  His statements about not placing values on grades are false.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2005<br>Class Name: SCU207<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The man is a nice guy, but as a professor is pretty lacking.  I got a good grade with little effort, not counting the hours of frustration while in class and trying to figure out what the assignment requirement were.  Take with a different teacher if you need this class.  I'm not even kidding.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2005<br>Class Name: SCU207<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible teacher, nice guy.
