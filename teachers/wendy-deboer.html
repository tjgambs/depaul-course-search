If you do your work, attend class (especially on fridays) and have a good attitude you will find the class easy. She was fun, young and tried to make a class that was rather dull, enjoyable. She also came to our level and used terms and analogies we were familiar with.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2007<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a nice lady that means well, but has little teaching experience (and it seems to show). Her classes are the dullest I've attended thus far at DePaul. She teaches materail that you probably learned in jr high or elementary school--it actually insults your intellegence. Easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>VEEErrryyy Easy teacher! She is funny! But you don't learn much in her class. I have NO IDEA WHY PEOPLE ARE GIVING HER FROWNS! wow Those people must like to get a lot of homework or something. she doesnt deserve that at all. You don't even really need to show up either..lol i had a blast with group discussions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2006<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't expect to get your papers back in time to learn from your mistakes.  Also, if you ask &quot;too many&quot; questions, expect the answers to become sarcastic.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2006<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2006<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought she would be a great professor given the fact that she's an attorney. However, her instructions for papers are very unclear.  Specifically, when she tried to teach how to evaluate a paper. Her instructions were completely off guard and nothing made sense.  If you're the type of person who likes specific instructions, don't take her!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do the essays and work and you'll be fine. Great professor and is very specific what she wants from your papers. Take her if you get a chance, and dont believe mr negative.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2005<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wendy is great! she's very clear and just do ALL your work! she'll give you a good grade, and just be on time to class and SHOW UP!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2005<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wendy was such an awesome teacher--she is always available to help and makes things very clear for every student. As long as you put in the effort with your research and papers, you will get a good grade. She is lenient, understanding, and very nice. I would strongly recommend anyone take her if you are looking for a fun and relatively easy course.</div></div></div></body></html>
