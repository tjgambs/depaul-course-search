No one cares or aspires to be you, because you can't even teach the subject in a comprehensible manner! I just read the book and tuned him out...resulting in an A, but learned nothing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: CMN244<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He chooses favorites and pretty much ignores everyone else. He teaches right from powerpoints that he posts before class.He gives weekly quizes usually on Fridays along with weekly Friday mini assignments No midterm, Final was same format as quizes. He gave some extra credit opportunities. I would take him again, but hes not that friendly or helpfu</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2008<br>Class Name: CMN256<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His class is EXTREMELY helpful and DOES improve your knowledge on writing PR and Advertising stuff.  HOWEVER, he sometimes makes you feel like an idiot when you ask a question; try not to take it personally, he's just really 'matter-of-factly.' Fairly easy grader, just get your stuff in on time.  He makes good suggestions for improving your writing</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2007<br>Class Name: CMN244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Prof!! I have taken him 4 times and am sad that there's not much else I can take from him... He's involved in the PR industry and is super helpful with applying his own real life examples. Always willing to meet with you outside of class. Also has been great about helping me find internships and giving me industry contacts. TAKE HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2007<br>Class Name: CMN244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bosak is awesome!  He makes some pretty funny comments and is always upbeat and willing to answer any questions you might have.  He does a lot of powerpoints and can sometimes go through them a little to quickly, but he puts them up on blackboard so even if you miss some slides you're fine.  I would definitely take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2007<br>Class Name: CMN271<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the most WORTHLESS classes I ever took.  He is the biggest prick.  He picks favorites and simply ignores those he doesn't care for.  Plays useless videos every day.  Take this class because it's a damn easy joke, not for the credibility or usefulness of the professor.  Can't wait to get out.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2007<br>Class Name: CMN244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is awesome! he's fun and really helpful.  you can tell he has a lot going in on his personal life so he never wastes student's time.  i've had him for 3 classes and want to take him once more before i graduate.  DEFINITELY take him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2007<br>Class Name: CMN595<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Bosak is an awesome professor. I have graduate classes with him, and while the material can be a little dry (and thus the class is a bit dry), he's very nice, helpful, and tells cheesy jokes to keep us awake. I recommend him if you want a decent professor that you'll enjoy learning from.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2006<br>Class Name: CMN255<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Keeps class extremely interesting! Probably the only class I actually wanted to go to!! Funny guy, easy going. Weekly assignments (very easy) No midterm, only a final exam. I'm taking him again next quarter, he's great!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/21/2006<br>Class Name: CMN255<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher was SO EASY!! Yeah he was a little unclear about the midterm, but when everyone in our class failed it, he let us retake it and practically GAVE us the answers. The final project is really easy too, this guy is really laid back and just wants you to learn the info.. I don't think he really cares about letter grades.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2006<br>Class Name: CMN255<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor was horrible.  He was VERY unclear in what he expected from us for projects, assignments, and midterm/final. When it came time for group grading assignments, he completely took the thoughts of the students instead of grading for himself.  So, if you have to take this class with him, make sure your group LOVES you or you're in trouble</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2006<br>Class Name: CMN525<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Totally disorganized.  I did not learn anything new from this class and was constantly trying to figure out what he wanted from us.  There were a lot of disssatisfied people in the class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2006<br>Class Name: CMN256<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He teaches EXACTLY from the book. It's kind of a waste to even read it- in fact, don't buy it. He never has you use it for writing in class assignments. You start the assignment in class and then bring in the final copy the next week. He'll have everyone share their work and we all critique it. He'll tell you exactly what to change.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2005<br>Class Name: CMN255PR<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Perhaps the best instructor I've had yet at DePaul-- lectures were clear, concise and interesting-- he really knows his stuff.  As others suggested, come to class and pay attention.  His exams are straight out of the power points he uses.  HIGHLY recommend, especially for those with an interest in PR.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2005<br>Class Name: PR<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a super nice guy and very helpful.  He puts all of the Powerpoints on Blackboard, so you don't have to take notes.  He keeps attendance--do go to class!  Only a midterm, final and group project/presentation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2005<br>Class Name: CMN<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very good teacher, his class was not hard, just pay attention and keep notes.  Overall, fairly easy grader and a good guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2005<br>Class Name: CMN255<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The driest material ever. I challenge you to count how many times you come across the words &quot;process&quot; &quot;strategy&quot; & &quot;resources&quot; in the text. If business & its ridiculously convoluted accompanying jargon is your thing, than this class is for you. He hated me ever since I missed 1 class (ONLY 1 & I've never been late!)</div></div></div></body></html>
