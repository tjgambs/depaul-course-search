If you cannot manage an A in this class then you don't deserve to be taking senior level classes.  There is a lot of readings, but they are all manageable.  You walk out of the class learning a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2007<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the class is fun and the simulation is great, but things are rushed and not explained all that well</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2007<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has realistic expectations and seems to genuinely care about teaching.  Readings are relevant to current market events and help you understand real world situations, rather than text book examples. The Simulation is interesting and fun.  If you do poorly in the class, you only have yourself to blame since it does take work to keep up with class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2007<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>honestly, if you think the coursework is too hard and you are expected to know what you feel is beyond your breadth, then you are not worthy of senior status. Professor is a professional and treats and expects the same of you. Her knowledge and strive is inspiring and real life coursework puts the competitive business world in retrospect.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2007<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>class just sucks and if you have any background in finance, math, econ, or acct. class is pointless</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2007<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>15% of your grade is the simulation. you get put in a group. if the group sucks, you suck. tough pop up quizzes. expects you to do hard assignments and know miniscule details about whats going on in the simulation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2007<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a useless class and such an unclear professor. very hard assignments and pointless waste of time. If u want to save time and money just get a corporate vocabulary and expand infrastructure synergy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2006<br>Class Name: MGT219<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is highly reccomended if you are pursuing business. She brings to class a great deal of insight and experience. She also keeps the students engaged and busy. Be forewarned that she has little tolerance for people who do not work so this is not a class to sleep through. Very helpful outside of class should you choose to pursue help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2006<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very unclear. She thinks this is an upper level managemnet class, tossing around all these articles for us to read and interpret. Useless quizzes on the capstone simulation. Very boring and dry lectures. She doesen't seem to realize that there are other people besides mkt and mgt majors in this course. Flys through material and expects you to know.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2006<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Has an obscene amount of real world knowledge and portrays it in an understandable way. Really easy to talk to and has a great personality. The best professor I have had at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2005<br>Class Name: MGT219<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing.  Take the class.  Talk in class.  Read the work.  Discuss the papers with her before you turn it in.  You'll get an A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2005<br>Class Name: MGT219<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She may be intimidating at first but she is actually the nicest woman!  Talk to her out of class and she will give you tips on papers and quizes.  The class has a crazy amount of reading but do it and participate in class and you will do well.  She is my favorite professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2005<br>Class Name: MGT219<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she assigns a lot of reading and makes the subject harder than it needs to be. she is helpful out of class only. She made me twice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2005<br>Class Name: MGT392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher with great new approaches to teaching. Keep up with the reading and listen in class and you are guaranteed an A. Very helpful and aware of academic overload. Will push back deadlines if necessary.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2005<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>unflexible and fast-paced.goes thru material fast w/out good explanations.her answer is usually&quot;its in the book&quot; LOTS OF REQUIRED READING!calls on people so you better have read it.lots of projects and activities. overachiever who makes students feel stupid. would NEVER take her class again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2004<br>Class Name: ISP395<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A LOT OF READING ASSIGNMENTS!!
