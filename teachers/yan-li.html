DO NOT TAKE. I REPEAT, DO NOT TAKE ANY CLASSES WITH THIS TEACHER.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2012<br>Class Name: PSY419<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yan Li works hard to get her students interested-- an impressive feat when a bunch of grad students are staring vacantly at her after she asks us to add 1+2. Others may be daunted, but she tries her best. And she's always willing to help! You'll have to study for her tests, but if you reach out, she'll help you get your A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2011<br>Class Name: PSY333<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an okay professor. Her tests aren't too bad if you read the book, attend the lectures and study what's on the study guide. The papers aren't too bad either, and the presentation is easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2011<br>Class Name: PSYALL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Li is awesome!  I really enjoyed her class and I recommend her to all.  She is helpful, friendly, and very knowledgeable on the subject.  She is a fair grader and makes classes interesting.  Her examples are helpful too.  She gives you what you will need in practical terms, which is very useful.  I STRONGLY recommend Professor Li.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2011<br>Class Name: PSY333<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Homework did not require the use of a textbook. Her lectures can be boring but they provide a lot of information, almost all of it on the exams. Exams were multiple choice and short answer, slightly difficult. Professor Li is very nice though and seems very willing to meet with students outside of class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2011<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very difficult class. the grading is done all by the ta and since ta's have something to prove, they grade very hard. 3 exams, 4 online quizes, one long research project, the guidelines for which are vague. do not take this class unless you like intense work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2010<br>Class Name: PSY333<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a really good prof. She trys to keep things interesting. tests are off the lectures which are on blackboard. willing to work with you. test are easy. there is a long study guide for 24 questions, but this is college 300 level course. you can't expect her to give you the exact questions to the exam. Very very nice lady. take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2009<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her for research methods 2. i found that her teaching style forced you to learn unless you dont pay attention. she'll give examples until the absent students get it! hard but honest grader, willing to help, very knowledgable and really sweet if you go up to her. she knows students have questions and praises those who ask.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2009<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was difficult at times because of the material but she was always willing to give extra help or explain things. It's definitely possible to do well if you study for tests and put some effort into the group project.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2008<br>Class Name: PSYCH303<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Li is one of the wrost psychology instructor(s) that I've experience since I've chosen this study. She has thrown me for a loop. Her lecturing was very challenging!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2008<br>Class Name: PSYCH353<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The teacher is unclear with communication. Her study guides are unhelpful. She gives 10pg study guides for only 20 guestions and 5 short answer question. Her accent makes it difficult to understand her and she barely answered questions in class. She's very boring and I wouldn't take her again. If you like sleeping in she's the professor for you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2008<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's nice, but her accent can make it hard to understand and she writes the exams like she talks, so they're sometimes hard to read too. She isn't very good at explaining things and it could just be the information, but her class was always dull. That class isn't very difficult. There's weekly quizzes, group project, two tests, and a final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2008<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teacher is never prepared for class. She doesn't want anything to do with her students. She gave me an eight page &quot;study guide&quot; which was just the bullets from the slide show. I used to be a Psych major so I know how terrible this was. Stay away, will give you no help. 6 page study guide for 20 question... said enough...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2008<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful teacher, will work with students anytime. Exams however are fairly difficult, even with sufficient studying, almost too difficult for a research methods class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2008<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Li  is extremely nice & understanding. However, it can be difficult to communicate with her at times. She will work with anyone who is struggling. She really cares about her students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2008<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The majority of the quarter I disliked her. I met with her at the end of the quarter and she spent time explaining to me what I needed to do and even gave me extra attention during the lab sessions. I was able to bring my grade from a D+ to B. I would not recommend her unless you are comfortable with Research Methods. Keep up in class, you'll be ok</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2007<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is useless, very unclear, he powerpoint slides are typed paragraph by paragraph from the book. Yan Li does not prepare well for the class she starts homework assignments guidelines right before class along with everything else she has to do. Her exams are utterly impossible because of their incoherency. Her lectures are boring/useless.</div></div></div></body></html>
