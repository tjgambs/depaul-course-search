Videos in class, go to plays and talk about them - not bad.  She gives worksheets before the quizes</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2009<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was overall easy if you attend the plays and write decent papers on them you'll receive an easy A or B in the class. Can be unorganized but very nice lady willing to help. She may seem a little crazy but she makes the class interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2008<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice lady, but unorganized; didn't stick to the syllabus and lectures were all over the place. Seeing four plays was expensive and took up a lot of time. Quizzes were semi-hard, and she doesn't grade that easily on the responses. Don't expect an easy A; you definitely have to work for it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2008<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>U go see 4 really different, but really interesting plays. Worth the $. She also does a good job of teaching the history of theater through in class movies, short stories, etc. As long as you put some effort in trying to understand the deep meaning of the plays u'll do great. She basically tells you want to know and study for on the quizzes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2008<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very cool teacher.

You see 3-4 plays and analyze them, read 5 plays and analyze them, easy quizzes, and you have to memorize 10 lines of shakespere for the final. Make sure she knows who you are likes you, it could come in handy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2006<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>****y wannabe artistic lady... for the most part people found her easy, was a total **** to me cause i always came late. dont get on her bad side, once on it, she assumes you cheat and gives u a hard time. one thing thats easy is you have to memorize 15 lines of a play for ur final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2006<br>Class Name: THE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's very fair.  She's a theatre weirdo, so be warned -- but in general it's a pretty interersting corse.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2006<br>Class Name: THEATRE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a great teacher.  If you're taking this class for an easy 'a', well, it's ok, but you'll do a lot of work, but you'll learn a lot.  She has us go to a lot of plays, and that's the best part.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2006<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2006<br>Class Name: THE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A pretty good class. There's a lot of writing, and you have to go plays-but we got to talk about them in class. Her style is a little wacky - but keeps it fun.  Problem with this class is it fills with a bunch of idiots who think its like an easy 'A' and they don't read the assignments, so they can't take part in the discussion.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2006<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2006<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you're used to 'regular classes' that have some structure, you'll suffer.She changes assignments constantly so it is hard to keep up.You have to see 5 plays, write 4 papers on them, present one; read 5 books, write analysis; a quiz every now and then. I think she's a nice person, but she's just a bad bad teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2006<br>Class Name: THEATER<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class and you learn a lot.  She's goofy which makes the class interesting.  Cliff notes, Sparknotes, etc. work well with this class.  Start putting money in your piggy bank because you are going to have to see some shows and pay for your own ticket (some are cheap some are not).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2005<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class.

Got to see some good plays and learn about some classics. Did have to read much of anything.  We went over everything in class and she never really had a due date for assignments. Jen Goode is definately a theater person and finds ways of making the simplest tasks dramatic. I really enjoyed this class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2005<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is a joke. Yes, you have to read and see a couple of plays, but I turned in all my papers and outlines late and still mananged to get an A- in the class. Totally worth your Depaul money and time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2005<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she sure is a piece of work! funny lady, i enjoyed the class even thought i'm a commerce student. lots of work! reading, writing, seeing (4) plays, quizzes, but it was one of the best classes i have taken at depaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2005<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is easily distracted and doesn't seem like she's that prepared for class all the time</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2005<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is time consuming because you have to see three plays.If you don't have time to go to these plays during the weekend, don't even bother signing up for this class.She gives you opportunities to make up quizes by seeing other plays.You have to write two mini papers and three reaction papers</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2005<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this class is the worst class i have ever taken.  she makes u see like 4 plays that are like $20 per play, her midterm is ridiculous and her lectures are boring as hell and of subject. never take her she is horrible!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2005<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Aight, i am a business major and i had to take, what i thought was a stupid theater class, turns out this class and professor has to be one the best i have taken at DePaul.

Don't take this class if you are not at all interested in reading plays because there are quite a few. Short readings and short papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2004<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>so much work for a 100 level class, she is nice but boy is there a lot of work work work</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2004<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a bad teacher, but a lot of writing assignments, nice lady, knew what she was talking about</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2004<br>Class Name: THEATER<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2004<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teache is anal when it comes to being 1 min. late.
