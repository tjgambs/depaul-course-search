The most boring teacher EVER!  Just hear him talk is like listening to a chalk screeching on a blackboard.  He has a class manual that is 367 pages! A book that is 672 pages!  I'll tell you, the 367 page class manual is just HORRIBLE! He uses the word &quot;thing&quot; all the time- very poor vocab!</div></div></div></body></html>
