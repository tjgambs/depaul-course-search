Students would get marked down for not including certain things in their reflections-yet the prof didn't even know what was supposed to be in them. 6 reflections, daily readings, group project, presentation, 2 papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2011<br>Class Name: PAX220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The course was engaging and the material was relevant to present day studies of PAX.  She challenged the class to think critically and created a safe space for discussions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/25/2010<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had interesting community projects. However, she is set in her own point of view of Puerto Rican history and not open to others.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2010<br>Class Name: PAX220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She does care about her students. She will assign readings that are thought-provoking. Some of the speakers that she invited really inspired me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2010<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Marisol for Explore Puerto Rican Chicago and Focal Point: Puerto Rico.  She is an extremely knowledgeable woman and cares about her students.  You use the book a great amount in class and the work load is manageable.  Take her because she is a great professor and you will learn something.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2010<br>Class Name: PAX220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really great class, recommend it.  Marisol brings in so many interesting guest speakers which really makes the class much more appealing. You are required to take part in an activist engagement project which seemed to be more enjoyable for some than others depending on the organization they were working with. Participation is judged critically.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2009<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Marisol is an awesome teacher who is very passionate about her work and field of study. She is very helpful and really down to earth. The class is easy and she brings alot of guest speakers so the class is very interesting. I recommend this class. The first comment is not true. She is an awesome professor and cars about all her students :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2009<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Didn't really know what she was doing. EXTREMELY biased point of view, very close minded. Actually didn't like the white kids in the class, and I wouldn't say that unless I actually felt that. Don't take her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2007<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Marisol portrayed Puerto Ricans in a revolutionary light that I had never seen before. It was refreshing. She attempted to teach her class about Puerto Rican history and struggle (which remains almost entirely unwritten.) Unfortunately, her lectures were unstructured, her syllabus unclear, and her themes, redundant.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2006<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ms. Morales is a passionate & cool teacher who wants her students to understand Puerto Ricans. She's also a cool person to talk to. She's always there for you!</div></div></div></body></html>
