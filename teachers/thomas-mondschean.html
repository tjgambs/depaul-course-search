Therefore the exams cover a lot of material. GET TO STUDYING EARLY! You can NOT wait the night before to study. His slides cover high level topics out of the textbook , therefore he expects you to read the textbook. He adds attendance points to your test score.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2014<br>Class Name: ECO322<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Mondschean is one of the most knowledgeable ECO professor in DePaul. He is an expert in financial policy, banking. Instead of regular form of PPT teaching, his lectures cover a large range of topics regarding to the banking system. Midterm and final are take-home essay, a presentation is required as well. Take him if you love economics.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2013<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was ok. It was rather boring and the lectures were not the most exciting. It wasn't a difficult class as long as you study the handouts. Midterm and Final are both 50% of the grade. Not bad overall but I'm glad its over.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2013<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor I've ever had. His lectures are incredibly boring and he rambles on. No one ever knows what to pay attention to. He never does what he says he will, and takes forever to grade. He also tries to push his political views on you. There is no structure to his class whatsoever. Avoid him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2013<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very very very boring lectures.

Grade is 50% midterm and 50% final. Multiple choice test with a few problems which identical to the ones on his study guide. Read the chapter summaries thoroughly, complete and understand his study guide thoroughly, and it's an easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2011<br>Class Name: ECON315<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worthless teacher.

Very good professor and very passionate about class topic. Attendance isnt mandatory but EC is given for coming to class.STUDY his handouts and you should be able to get an A.

He lectures the entire class period and frequently gives handouts (i.e. notes and practice quizzes for midterm and exams). There's a midterm and a final. Study his handouts and read the book and you should at least get a B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2010<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For me the class was really boring but his handouts and practice tests are KEY to getting a good grade. If you want the highest grade possible definitely just read the book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2010<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He leads off classes with about an hour of discussion revolving about current events and how economics plays a role. High level at times, but very interesting. I would take classes taught by him again if I had the chance, but I understand his teaching style is not for everyone. Can go off on tangents at times, but is passionate about the topic.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2010<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor did really know his stuff and had a lot of good information,  just very unstructured and hard to follow where he was going.  Very tough for a non-finance major to understand.  He was a fair grader, though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2009<br>Class Name: ECON315<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very good teacher he knows his stuff. Just read the packets and do the practice exam problems and you should get at least a B. plus you get a total of 10 extra points through out the year if you go to class everyday. material is common sense knowledge. He always asks if there are any questions Take advantage of them!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2009<br>Class Name: ECON509<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lectures are hard to follow and not very helpful. Just writes equations really fast and hardly explains what he is doing. I spend most class just trying to keep up with his chaotic writing. Did most of my learning from the book. Also, gave absolutely no guidance for mid-term, which is 45% of grade. Pre-lecture discussions are interesting and useful</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2009<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>@ post 2 below me, he said if the financial crisis doesnt spark your interest you shouldnt be in BUSINESS school.Not an easy A,but youll learn a lot.At times his lectures go off on tangents but most of the time it will be interesting.He gives handouts that are helpful.Tests are hard but not imposible almost 1/4 of class got raw score &gt;90 on midterm</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2009<br>Class Name: ECON509<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is not structured at all, and he is all over the place with his thoughts. Wish he had slides or something.  Also, he doesn't tell you the format of the exam, or what will be on it... just that you should study 5 chapters and know equations!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2009<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the worst professors I've ever taken. He can't even finish a thought. He skips around all the time. One time, he gave us an equation and some numbers and then just wrote down the answer. He didn't even explain to us what he did to get it. He also told our class that if we weren't interested in economics then we shouldn't be in school.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/04/2009<br>Class Name: ECON315<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>don't take him at all.He is really hard and not even helpful I would not recommend him taking.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2009<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For those who stated DePaul needs new econ professors I can c DPU is not the right choice for u. Hes a smart professor who knows much info, thus one can learn lots from him. Those in eco 315- please thats basic material. Read Wall Street, etc and u might be able to apply ur knowledge. Its University guys.. get with the program.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2009<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He does now his stuff. Starts class by discussing any topics related to Economics and Finance. The bad thing is he only lectures. There are no quizzes just Midterm and Final exam which are multiple choice. He does give you study guides but they are deceiving. You need to make sure to read the chapters, know the concepts and practice on your own.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2008<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class and great professor. With everything going on in the financial world this is the most relevant class you can take. Mondschean is a very smart guy and is passionate about economics. His tests are mostly m/c and straight-forward, class discussion often gets interesting, and you get points added onto your final for attending class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2008<br>Class Name: ECON509<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Generous grader if you PUT IN the effort. 2008 is a good time to take the class, but prof expects you to already know the basics in order to have good class discussion. Too bad this is the class where you are supposed to learn the basics. Willing to help, but has a condescending demeanor that may scare you off. Prepare to marry your textbook.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2008<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Talked down to students thus discouraging questions and conversation which means sitting and listening to him ramble.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2008<br>Class Name: ECON509<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is extremely knowledgeable professor. He is also extremely unorganized professor. You can learn a lot from him if you have interest in the subject. Not recommended if you do not have any interest in Macroeconomics as he will make things hard for you. Exams are moderately hard. Final is a take home exam.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2008<br>Class Name: ECON315<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is hard.  Economics is already a difficult class and he definitely makes it harder.  He lectures, and lectures, and talks and talks.  Its hard to be attentive for that long.  Also, grade is based on midterm and final. If you dont read, youre screwed.  However, I did learn A LOT more than I have than in most of my other classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2008<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>After 10 weeks of mind numbing lecture, you will be asked to write essays for your final exam.  These essays are based on case studies(one is his) that are almost as brutal as his lectures.  You must buy the book because you don't learn in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2008<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was my favorite class at DePaul.  He was probably one of the best professors I've had.  Very smart, explains things well, gives you 1 extra credit point for every class you attend and curves exam.  Only midterm and final though.  If you study your notes and do practice problems he gives you'll be fine.  Definitely reccomend taking him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2008<br>Class Name: ECON315<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is hard. Theres only a midterm and a final. The midterm is not bad, he adds on 10 pts if u were in class everyday and he curves it too! the final is hard considering he lets you use only his little calcs and not ti's so don't stre your formulas in the ti's or you'll be screwed! Over all not bad!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/17/2008<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dull and boring. Lectures are useless because he doesn't explain the material clearly- so be prepared to learn everything from the book. The entire grade is based off your midterm and final. Honestly, one of the dullest classes I've taken at DePaul. This school really needs better econ professors.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2007<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>good guy, but a bit over his students' heads, which can make things boring. definitely a lecture class w/o a lot of discussion. attendance not mandatory, but one pt./class EC assigned to those who go. 50% midterm, 50% final-- based mostly on study packet/handout notes. helpful guy, boring class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2007<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>took him over summer.

I took this class over the summer (not recommended). He didn't know how to use time wisely over a 5 week course. in the last week we had a paper and take home exam worth 60% of our grade.

Letures are long and boring. Attendence is mandatory. Everything is based on midterm and final.

If he sees that your interested in the class, he will help you. No attendence req. Midterm and Final are not hard, but only if you read and take notes in class.
