HE EXPECTS YOU TO KNOW STATISTICS AND HE WILL TEST YOU ON IT W/O EVEN EXPLAINING THE MATERIAL. HE NEVER WENT THROUGH THE HOMEWORK AND HAD US WORK ON A GROUP PROJECT THAT WE HAD NO CLUE HOW TO DO. TAKE HOME IS ON STATISTICS WHICH WE NEVER WENT THROUGH IN CLASS... I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2009<br>Class Name: MGT202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The only thing I can think of is: This is ridiculous! It is a shame that DePaul lets this person teach. He does not explain anything, we have weekly assignments, and we have a team project/presentation that is impossible to figure out. I rather not graduate than take this class! It is that horrible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2008<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Well educated and knows all about current events.  Not much of a teacher, so make sure you read the book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2008<br>Class Name: MGT202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You will be completely on your own for this class. He is not helpful at all. You sit in class while he talkes about things not related to the class and then gives you an impossible final. Do not take this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/22/2007<br>Class Name: MGT202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is not helpful. doesnt respond to emails. does not explain the assignments. all he does is post them on blackboard and we have to do them.  stats is hard when he doesnt teach it. he doesnt give you detail on how he wants the work done and then he takes points off because you didnt do it the way he wanted!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/12/2007<br>Class Name: MGT202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is so disorganized.  He never even gave us a syllabus.  Made us pay for a $160 dollar book for a 5 week, 2 credit class.  Do NOT take!</div></div></div></body></html>
