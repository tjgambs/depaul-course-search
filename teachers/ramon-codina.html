Professor Codina included things we didn't even learn on our midterm and gave the excuse that "you should learned this already in other classes." I studied all the material we learned in class but If you want to do well on exams, study general finance as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2015<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very smart and funny. The subject is somewhat of a review of other business classes such as money & banking and some accounting classes. If you took those classes first then this class should be pretty easy. Weekly online quizzes and two tests.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2015<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Codina is great! He has a unique sense of humor and also takes the time to give his personal opinion on a lot of topics without just giving boring lectures by reading from power point slides.  The class consists of 2 tests and two mini papers.  Take it with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/31/2014<br>Class Name: FIN380<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Codina is a very brilliant. He grades based on your thought process rather than your answer in this course, in other words he values a creative thought process and a slightly incorrect answer than a traditional thought process and a supposed correct answer. You will learn a lot for practice in the real world as opposed to theory.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2014<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Codina is a horrible teacher, He does not teach, he expects you to learn from the book entirely. In class all that is accomplished is examples and he does not even help you with the examples if you have a question. Then when going over the examples he does not use equations from the books he uses his own. Avoid this teacher unless last resort.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>NOT A GOOD TEACHER.

Codina is a very nice guy and will like you if you show some effort. His exams were difficult. Group homework problems due each week that you grade yourselves, a midterm, and final - both in class and open notes and book. Study the homework problems and recommended exercises for exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2013<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Codina is a great guy who has a lot of experience in the Finance world. You don't have to learn ANYTHING to get a decent grade in this class bc the Midterm and Final are both take-home :). That being said, you CAN learn a lot if you really want to and put in the time. If you want an easy pass, this is your guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2013<br>Class Name: FIN524<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a professional guy who used to run his own business.

He's not to blame entirely b/c DePaul restructured the Fin 555 course so everyone does the same thing.  FIN 524 I took as a follow up and isn't what I expected. Busy group work mainly, not the best value courses at Depaul but mandatory for most finance people.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2011<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was excited going into this class as Dr. Codina got his Phd at Northwestern, I figured this would be a challenging course. Sigh. The course is all group work and FIN 101 for the MBA students who have never taken a FIN course. Dr Codina is a nice guy, but not a great professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/25/2010<br>Class Name: FIN380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best class ever. Fantastic professor. Take him, you will not regreat. The other postings, about the case studies, beeing hard....lasy students that don't want to study at all, and think they deserve an A.

He is extremely intelligent,knowledgeable,easy going and interesting. I truly gained a lot of knowledge and better understanding of finance by attending his class. I would highly recommend this professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2010<br>Class Name: FIN380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have Taken Codina for Fin 380, and I enjoyed every bit of it. He is an excelent Professor with a lot of knowledge through his work experience. He was teaching us some &quot;secrets&quot; in the world of finance. If you want to stand out in the future and have a sucessful career, Take The Class. Easy grader, nobody can get under a B. Go to class though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2010<br>Class Name: FIN524<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I HIGHLY recommend this class!It is case studies and is a bit challenging but people forget that this is GRAD school!if you want to learn this class has stimulating debates and constructive criticism involved for every case presentation.Don't waste your time and others' if you only want an A.it's a shame for such a good class not to enjoy it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2010<br>Class Name: FIN524<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took Codina for FIN555 & thought he was a great teacher. Made class understandable to students without a finance background. So was happy to take his FIN 524 class. WRONG CHOICE. His teaching style completely changed. TOUGH case studies. EXTREMELY CRITICAL on all group presentations & made presenting a miserable experience. Didn't teach much.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2009<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Codina does a poor job teaching FIN 555.  He is hard to understand.  He grades participation/attendence but does not even take attendence.  Although most of the class did not miss ONE class session, no one received full participation points which is worth 20% grade. I STRONGLY recommend taking any other professor for this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2009<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! Very interesting class and, by far, the most useful class I have taken at DePaul (despite the fact that I'm not FIN major). Highly recommended!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2009<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Codina's helpful, but he's too helpful. Class discussion was dominated by one student who didn't understand basic accounting (or math). We spent lots of time on the simple material and breezed through the difficult stuff. He needs to worry less about &quot;helping&quot; and tell certain students to meet him after class instead of wasting the whole class time</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2009<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Codina is a good professor, though he can be a bit confusing at times.  If you pay attention in class, the midterm and final are fairly straightforward.  The book was very useful.  He also grades particiapation, which is a bit strange for a finance lecture course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2008<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His &quot;future&quot; methods are ok, but the class is to learn the foundations of finance. You will have to become best friends with the textbook. Things make sense when he lectures, but once you leave the classroom and work on assignments, watch out! Tests are comprehensive and looooooong. Be sure to keep up with the homework. Prof is kind & worldly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2008<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very kind professor.  All his multi-choice questions directly from MyEconLab.  The class feels like info overload, but he grades really easy!  Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2008<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Confusing. Unclear. Waste of money and time! Did NOT learn a thing.

His lectures are lifted straight from the textbook which is itself overly complicated and contains more information than required. Avoid like the plague!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2008<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yes he can be brutal but Codina is a nice guy, he cares about the students and tries to help. However, he can be confusing and misleading, but it gets better after a few weeks. If you study hard you will learn a lot and do well. I liked that he also thought the sources and uses of net liquid assets and not only CF.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2008<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is brutal.  Teaches by reading textbook publisher slides.  Homework consisted of online questions with online exams.  He attempted to teach additional material but ended up confusing and frustrating the class.  Very poor professor for a class that has a great deal of valuable content.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2008<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher! Doesn't teach anything that useful in the real world. Teaches his way of finance when the professional world uses another. I didnt learn anything in his class. I'm a straight A student too, so it's not like I'm lazy. This guy sucks at teaching FIN 333. Just has you put numbers into a program, but doesnt teach you anything about it</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2008<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a good teacher, explaines material well and has interesting stories.

Better than most finance teachers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2007<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really did not learn much from him. His lectures are basically verbatim to the textbook.  He uses an online and inclass tests.   The online portion takes a ton of time to study for.  Basically, he setup that class so that there was little effort on his part.  (i.e.  book provided slides, online tests, etc.)   I would not take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2007<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Codina is a nice guy, but he has his own way of doing things. He forces you to learn how to calculate Net Liquid Assets, which is annoying (EVERYBODY uses Free Cash Flow). On-line portions of midterm and final were manageable; in-class exams were OK. DON'T take this class in 5-wk format; keeping up with the discussion board was impossible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2007<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Codina is a nice guy and good professor with a lot of international experience.  That being said, I advise against taking his FIN555 in a 5-week session.  Things moved way too quickly and he tried to cram 1.5 courses into one session.  Take him in a 10-week session, but the class will be hard.  The discussion board was impossible to keep up with.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/28/2007<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really did not learn much from him.  I utilized the text for any questions I had.  His lectures are basically verbatim to the textbook.  His insistence on utilizing the discussion board for questions was annoying and cumbersome.  He wanted the students to learn from each other.  Great concept, but it did not work.  I would not take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2007<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a very nice professor and very helpful. He's also a good grader. The course is not easy but take it use Codina better than others. We had online midterm( which helps a lot for the in class) and in class midterm. The same thing for the final.Don't take this course in summer.You will not have enough time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2007<br>Class Name: FIN524<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Codina is by far the worst teacher I've had.  He does not teach anything & can't answer any questions- he expects the class to debate and answer each others questions. He spend most of the class trying to figure out the useless valuartion software.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2007<br>Class Name: FIN524<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Codina is a nice guy, and he is not a bad teacher but he spends almost the entire course teaching you this stupid software model that you will never use in the real world.

His class is challenging, but you will learn a lot.  He is very responsive and if questions are asked in class, he has the ability to break things down so that a novice can understand what is going on.  Accessible by email and makes time to meet during his office hours.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2006<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's very helpful, classes are fun. He makes you work hard on the most important concepts (homeworks and team projects). He likes to teach you different approaches of a topic and gives his opinion but encourages you to develop your own. Sometimes he's not too clear explaining some concepts but when people ask he can find a better way to explain it</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/29/2006<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought he was great!

You will have two assignments a midterm and a final. Put more effort into studying for the tets because they make up for most of you grade. Also he curves your final grades depending on the classes scores.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2006<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is a reason he's the most popular. The class is hard, but it would be with any professor. the first couple of classes are overwhelming, but stick with it. he's an easy grader. Don't spend too much time with the group project.

Not the most interesting but it’s useful.  He is real good at helping and really cares about his students.  Try and not take anything else this semester.  Overall a brutal class.  P.S. Dont spend your whole semester working on the project.  It’s only 20% of the grade and it can be a nightmare.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2005<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Codina rocks!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2005<br>Class Name: FN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a very good professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2005<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok, not very clear!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2005<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a nice person.
