She demonstrated a mastery of the material. Her enthusiasm was infectious! Only wish she were more strict with students eating, talking and on phones.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2014<br>Class Name: MCS348<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cary is hands down the best professor I've ever had! She is so helpful and insightful, but challenges you to think deeper.  She has great energy, is funny, but always on topic! Take her if you want to learn while having fun.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2014<br>Class Name: MSC271<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Elza is super nice, easy going and open minded. She's very excited about her class which makes her lectures interesting. There is some reading but you are not really test on it. Could get by with just listening to her lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2013<br>Class Name: 280COMM<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My favorite professor. She taught me a lot about media history without being impossibly strict, boring, or difficult. I had a lot of fun.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2013<br>Class Name: MCS353<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am obsessed with vampires now! You may not think this would be a useful class but I refer to it so much in my other classes now!! You watch really great movies!Cary is super nice and laid back.  You have a few quizzes that aren't hard if you've read/watched hw, you have to do 5 "summaries" of readings and there are 3 papers. Not bad at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2012<br>Class Name: MCS353<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class I took with her was on vampires, and it was really interesting! Her lectures were informative and entertaining. Not much class work besides small quizzes, 5 journals, midterm essays and a paper. Only negative would be that she doesn't seem to care too much about getting to know the students that well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/18/2012<br>Class Name: MCS351<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cary was my favorite professor at DePaul, by far. She's passionate and knowledgable about what she teaches. She's funny and interesting and her lectures are never boring. She doesn't use a textbook which is great. She's very engaging and overall AWESOME. Take her class whenever and as much as you can. I took her twice and it wasn't enough.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/07/2011<br>Class Name: MCS271<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cary is very passionate about what she teaches. She knows what she is talking about and her lectures and fun and interesting. She doesn't use a textbook so there's no dull rehashing of it. She assigns interesting journals and articles to read. There is a decent amount of work but it's really not bad at all. I wish I could take more classes with her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2011<br>Class Name: MCS271<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's really nice and open-minded, but the class is a little dull. Easy grader!</div></div></div></body></html>
