She taught right out of the book and doesnt explain in her own words. Expected us to remember things taught in algebra last quarter and didnt go over anything. I took that years ago!!

I had to teach myself pretty much everything. I've noticed that pretty much all the math teachers suck at DePaul? I wish she was a good teacher. She was nice but she is not meant to teach and it sucks that we have to pay so much for a sub-par teacher just because she has a 10 year.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/15/2013<br>Class Name: MAT100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: D+</div><div id="right"><div>She is a nice person however a very poor instructor. Our homework was through Pearson. Her lectures were fast and did not reflect homework. Pearson online sometimes would grade inaccurate. She was aware. Went to the tutoring center frequently and saw anywhere from 5-7 students from my class when I was there. I hired a private tutor.

She does not respond to emails and does not go over homework in class. You end up teaching yourself all of the material from the book.

However, as a teacher, she was awful. She made at least one mistake on the board every time class met.Bottom line is she needs to retire. If you take this class you will excel in falling alseep. Please be prepared to teach yourself the material.

She is by far one of the worst professor's I've had at school. She's extremely boring and not helpful in class. I had trouble staying awake in class and felt like she didn't teach at all.

I would NEVER take her again! She takes examples right out of the book, some of them are irrelevant to the subject we are talking about. If asked to do another example she will NOT, she has all of her notes written on a piece of paper and HAS to follow it.

I learned more from her than any other math teacher so far. You just have to pay a attention more and have more time for homework.

I thought I could still understand her even though you teach yourself, very hard class and its 101!

All she does is write what is in the book and does not teach anything. You pretty much have to teach yourself.

If you are forced to take this class buy MYMATHLAB even though it is not required. She can't teach you, you have to learn it on your own. Tests are short, so if you miss one question you fail. She was the laughing stock of the class, she reminds me of a bird who flits from one thing to another, clueless and confused.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2009<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Most boring calc class you will ever have. All she does is copy examples from the book. I sat in the back, listened to music, copied notes/examples from the book for 10 minutes while she &quot;taught&quot;. By the end of the class she barely got up to what I finished in 10 minutes without really explaining anything.

The examples she uses are exactly the ones on her quizzes and tests. You have to study outside of class as well as pay attention in class. I don't think its her that sucks, the subject is just really difficult for a lot of people to comprehend in the short 10 weeks she has to teach it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2009<br>Class Name: MAT126<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Pranger started out to be an ok teacher, but once you get into more complicated material she tends to not know what she is talking about. I agree with the prior comments, you will most definitely be teaching yourself. Class wasn't unbearable, but if you are not good at learning things on your own I would not recommend it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2009<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Despite all of the negative comments, Mrs. Pranger was actually a pretty good teacher.  As long as you show up to class and pay attention, you should do well in the class.  She makes the final 60% of your grade, but it was fairly easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2009<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you like learning things on your own, this class is for you. Professor has little to no interaction with the students, quiet, dull, homework is not checked, exams are 70% of the grade, the rest is quizzes and participation (which does not exist). One of the worst professors i've had so far. Prepare to learn most of the material on your own</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2009<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At the beginning it may seem as if she's doing ok,but it's cause the material is not so tough. As time goes on she confuses the crap out of you and doesn't answer questions right! I was 1 of the best students and got a B! I don't think anyone got an A! Don't take her, she does need to retire!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2008<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Please do not take Mrs. Pranger for any class. I read all the negative comments on this website and ignored them. I thought people were being lazy, but i was WRONG! SHE DOESN'T TEACH ANYTHING AND YOU END UP DOING EVERYTHING YOURSELF!

Looses her place constantly, and only teaches one method.  If you are good at math, but need to see things worked out different ways for you to be able to understand; DO NOT TAKE HER CLASSES!!!

If you can switch out, I'd recommend it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/24/2005<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good prof, lets you think, makes you think, learn a lot of good things in the class, just gotta put your mind to it, thats what you are in college for, right'&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2005<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want to go to class and walk out not knowing anything then take Pranger.  She is by far the WORST teacher at DePaul.  I don't even know how she was certified to be a teacher.  She needs to teach pre-school oh no wait they won't even understand her.  Her test and quizzes are impossible because she makes them up herself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2005<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2005<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very nice lady, but her tests have material she never taught in class.

Her biggest problem is her lecture talent, she continuously reitterates how easy material is despite her inability to clarify. Homework is not collected which is probably a bad thing, if your not good learning on your own expect a C at best!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2005<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class; do the readings; pay attention to his lectures and study the slides.

She's a nice lady, but the lectures aren't that clear. Feels like she takes the scenic route on a lot of explanations when they're rather simple. Lots of homework given but none collected.

He just talks and talks and talks some more. I really tried to get into the material but he just sucks the life from it. I absolutely hate going to his class.

Unless you are completely brain dead you will understand everything he says. He is not at all boring. Actually, quite the contrary. His lectures are very interesting and discussion is encouraged.
