She creates an environment where she makes her students feel incompetent and incapable of completing assignments to her ridiculously high standards.   Avoid taking her class at all cost, or be prepared to deal with cruella deville times ten.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2013<br>Class Name: TL412<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible professor, boring, and a harsh grader. Rather than helping us develop actual literacy teaching strategies and learning how to practically apply them to education, we would just copy and regurgitate information from the book (yeah super helpful for first time teachers). Would not take a class with her again, did not have a great experience.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/11/2010<br>Class Name: TL412<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Assigns long papers and lesson plans, but a great, really knowledgeable professor. Expects you to be able to write at a graduate school-level. Many students at DePaul can't and were averse to this class and professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2009<br>Class Name: TL412<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would recommend anyone to take her class. I learned a lot from her. She expects a lot from her students, but you get out what you put in. tip: if you don't do that well on an assignment, just ask her if you can redo it. she usually says yes, and you'll gain back points you missed. just ask her, she's really nice when you're interested.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2009<br>Class Name: TL412<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'd recommend her. She expects a lot from her students, but I felt she was really fair.

Don't take her.  If you want to actually learn or if you just want a good grade...she is not the professor to take!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2008<br>Class Name: TL412<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I WOULD NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!!! She is not helpful at all! Grades extremly harshly and very boring, no personality. The actual topic could be a lot more interesting if another professor taught it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2008<br>Class Name: TL201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor was unwilling to explain anything on her syllabus. It seemed as if she does not like teaching or interacting with her students because she would get annoyed when we asked questions or e-mailed her.  She is very smart but seems to be more of a scientist that belongs in the lab, not in the classroom.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/15/2008<br>Class Name: TL412<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I like Dr. Zecker. I wish, like in all T & L classes that we would forget the philosophical BS and do LESSON PLANS! LOTS OF ACTIVITIES!! That aside, work from the rubrics and syllabus. Talk to Dr. Zecker if you are confused- she lets you redo most assignments. She is cool. She knows a lot- it is there you just have to look for it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2008<br>Class Name: TL412<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the worst professor I've had so far at DePaul.  Dr. Zecker is totally unclear about what she wants for assignments and then grades them really hard.  When, as a class, we tried to get clarity on an assignment she literally rolled her eyes at us.  She was totally unhelpful, unclear, and just plain bad!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2008<br>Class Name: TL412<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the worst professor I've had so far at DePaul.

The book is a great reference and resource.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2007<br>Class Name: TL412<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the best teacher I've had so far at DePaul.  Just refer to the text and follow the writing samples she gives and you'll do great.  She actually teaches and is very intelligent.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2006<br>Class Name: TL412<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>need to retire</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2006<br>Class Name: TL412<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Zecker has very low energy and seemed to just be going through the motions.  She was difficult to talk to and seem to be much more of an academic.  She really didn't have real world experiences to share.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2006<br>Class Name: TL412<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think she's great.  Really knowledgeable.  Fun projects/assignments. She doesn't take any BS and expects you to work - but she has a good sense of humor once she warms up.  I'd recommend her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: TL412<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She knows what she is talking about, but make sure that you include everything that she wants otherwise you might be suprised by the grade you recieve on some of the assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2006<br>Class Name: TL412<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's very smart, has done a ton of research and knows her stuff. She is a fair grader and gives you opportunity to improve your grade on all assignments. She doesn't give you project requirements until about two weeks before the project is due, which is fine with procrastinators like me but frustrated some students. Overall a great professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2005<br>Class Name: TL412<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice teacher but her syllabus was hard to follow and she wasn't really willing to go into further explanations on it.  She required a lot and was a VERY hard grader.  There is an extra credit quiz offered at the end of the quarter and everyone had to take it to get an A or a B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2005<br>Class Name: TL412<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She really knows what she is talking about when it comes to early childhood literacy.  This is the first class in this program where I feel like I am leaving with more than just practice doing lesson plans.  I learned theories to guide me in the larger scope of teaching.  Harder than other classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2005<br>Class Name: TL412<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very mean, unorganized, unaccomodating professor. She will pop in a movie and leave class for 30 minutes while it is on. She will be the first person out of class at the end, making herself unavailable for help. She is like the student who packs their bag 10 minutes before class ends. Very Poor. F</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2005<br>Class Name: TL412<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unorganized. Unclear. Old Syllabi. Bad class. Bad teacher. Her mind seemed to be elsewhere and she was just going through the motions of teaching this class while teaching the class. Hard to understand (heavy accent). Great class if you like to watch movies and learn nothing. Take 412 elsewhere.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2005<br>Class Name: TL412<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very nice lady and good teacher.  covers a lot but all good techniques.  has fun, reasonable assignments.  a bit unclear, but she is very approachable and will help in every way.  I learned a lot and she made me very interested in the topin</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2004<br>Class Name: TANDL412<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>nice lady, not a great teacher, unclear expectations, unclear rubrics, I gained little from the class except how not to teach,</div></div></div></body></html>
