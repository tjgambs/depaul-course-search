However, the feedbacks she gave are not helpful. You always need to go back to her to improve your papers. Besides, her classes end 20-30 minutes earlier generally which is a good thing if you had a busy schedule...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2015<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a great professor even though she isn't afraid to call out your flaws in your paper in front of the whole class. She isn't a tough grader as long as you follow her feedback to ask for help. Barely any readings and the papers aren't that long either. She made me realize my potential as a writer. I would've totally taken her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2015<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Thinks she is funny, but really is not. Sitting through the class is always a huge pain. Goes off topic way too much and wastes your valuable time, however if you do not come to class she will give you an F for the assignment ruining your chance on a good great. No sympathy and does not care whether or not you have work due in other classes. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Took her class based on reviews that were posted here. She is very nice and friendly if you can make a connection with her.  Her gradings on papers are kind of vague because she can get confusing sometimes, try to speak to her and she'll give you extra chances to turn in work</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the perfect teacher if you are looking to get an English credit out of the way. She definitely helped me improve my writing skills with some really fun activities and assignments! We rarely stayed for the whole class period. She is the perfect professor for someone with a busy schedule!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Love this teacher! take her! no complaints! soo easy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Tilley is the BEST! She is willing to joke around with students and really makes an effort to get to know everyone in the room. She is very vocal about the flaws of her students writing and she will straight up tell you if something is bad, but IT HELPs! She's nice and really helpful. The best professor I've had at DePaul. I Learned so much.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class, you do not use any text books. Not really any reading homework either. 4 papers, usually interesting topics. She's really easy going and likes to have fun, you get out of class early almost every class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/14/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Funny but got off topic a lot and wasted time in class. She never used any textbooks so we never had reading homework and didn't give too many papers which was really good. Very laid back but wasn't afraid to tell you your paper wasn't good. Would take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very easy and relaxed teacher, but if you're attempting to learn anything and further your writing skills, don't bother taking this course with her. She's lazy, hates grading, and thinks that the students should self-motivate themselves to better their work. She gives little feedback unless you go out on a limb to beg for help. I disliked her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Really good professor. Fun, laughs a lot, let's class get out early all the time, not too many assignments, grades easy. Not much more you can ask for.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I absolutely loved Dr. Tilley! She's one of the few professors that actually CARES about your success! She was so helpful and always wanted me to do my best and ask for help whenever I needed it. She's fantastic! Take her for any and all classes you can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super nice, super friendly, super awesome, pretty funny, basically she is the bomb dot com. She let's you out of class early a lot. She doesn't require a boring text book for her class. She is inspiring and he class is pretty easy so long as you do the work. Great lady, I highly recommend taking her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Basically she is the bomb dot com!

Gave us extensions and an A on a paper just so that we would write her good reviews and stop complaining about her slow grading. Class almost always ends early. Nice if you have a busy schedule.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hated writing prior to this class but she makes it very easy for her students to do well! Highly recomend her. She goes over rough drafts with you so its impossible not to do good in her class. Ive had her for three quaters in a row by far my favorite professor at depaul!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Tileyy is new to DePaul! She's a great person! Class is moderate and fun! Not too much writing, but just enough! She tries hard to keep the writing simple and straight forward. You get to know the entire class! You do revisions with classmates, which can help! Digication was done in this class as well! She shows alot of videos!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I highly recommend her as a teacher. I took her for 103 and 104 and am really glad i did. She helps you with what ever you need and will give you great feedback. She loves what she does. Her 104 class is based on food which is FANTASTIC</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Love this professor. She makes writing papers extremely fun, and she always has topics that are interesting. Definitely take her for WRD 103 and 104. She is also willing to help, and gets back to emails super fast. Not the fastest paper grader though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Tilley is the best!  I strongly recommend her to any freshman, she helps students transition from high school to collegiate writing!  Also, you get to watch movies...always a plus when you want extra sleep in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful Professor. She is extremely helpful and wants everyone to succeed. She has clear expectations and clear assignments. The class is focused around FOOD!

The writing assignments are easy but the topics are really boring which isnt all that bad. shes very helpful. she will go out of her way to email you back right away. i really liked her so i'm in her WRD 104 class this semester.

Extremely helpful and responds to e-mails within minutes which is a plus. Class consisted of 5 papers each with an in-class peer review which made writing each one so much smoother and easier.
