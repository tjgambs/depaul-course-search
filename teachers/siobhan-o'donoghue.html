This class will be heavily based on the Christian/Lutheran Religion because the Author of the text is Lutheran (doesn't count for religion course). Siobhan is a great person and i LOVE her british accent! You just have to understand that she is very opinionated. Do the readings and your fine!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2009<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was ok. For a freshman introduction class it was nice to really get to know some new people. She really pushes her opinion on you which can sometimes become uncomfortable. You need to be a deep thinker to do well on her papers. Graded easy on everthing except papers. Shocker in the end when she put my solid A down to a B with hard grading</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2008<br>Class Name: DIS193<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i didnt like this class at all. shes very nice but the final is stupid its five pages of a topic that could only possibly be up to three. i rather take another class if i could. of all my class, this is my worse and most pointless class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2007<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her for Sacred Spaces, and she made everyone in the class really care about the material. She is very opinionated, but she offers her opinions in order to help her students foster their own opinions. There is heavy reading and homework, and the book is dull, but (at least for her Discover class) she grades EXTREMELY easily.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2007<br>Class Name: DISCO101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>wow i do not know who could have hated this teacher, she is one of the best i have ever had. She is so nice so friendly and is really looking out for her students, i learned so much from this class as well, she really helped open my eyes, TAKE THIS CLASS you wont regret it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2006<br>Class Name: ISP100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Siobahn is an amazingly intelligent woman.  She's tough on you when it comes to critical thinking, participating in discussion, and writing relevant papers.  However, she's understanding and interesting when teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2006<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Discover - loved it! Siobahn is helpful and lenient. She is willing to extend due dates. Attendence is a must, but class time is mostly worthwhile. There are many homework assignments, but they are EASY, reflections, you can't beat that. Take her if you can, she's awesome!  It was a great class, Sheila. I'll take any of her classes in the future.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2005<br>Class Name: DISCOVER<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This course could be a lot of fun...but it wasnt.  She forses you to discuss things you arent intersted in, is incredibly biased, and assumes everyone wants to hear her opinions over and over.  She never clarifies her assignments, though she grades them fairly easy, and does care about her students. If only the class wasnt such a drag.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2005<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Siobhan is a nice lady and a decent teacher, but this class sucks. The work load is way too big for a Discover class and the material is repetitive and boring. I suggest choosing another Discover class. Don't take Sacred Spaces/Powerful Places.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2005<br>Class Name: DISCOVER<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sacred Spaces Powerful Places, the Imersion week.. be prepared to do A LOT of walking!!! Class was for the most part a blow off. As long as u read n listen to the presenters you'll be fine. There is a presenter or a movie or sumthing every week. She is so sweet, and really does care about her students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2004<br>Class Name: DISCOVER<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took her Discover Chicago course &quot;Sacred Spaces, Powerful Places&quot; and it was really interesting.  Siobhan is a nice lady and she is concerned about her students.  This class focused more on participation than reading, which I thought was very</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2003<br>Class Name: DISCOVER<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>poor grrading for simple concepts.  didn't clarify papers.  focuses too much on text reading for a discover course.  papers outweigh participation which seems backward for the focus.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2003<br>Class Name: 63<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She made the class interesting and used varied styles (media, lecture, discussion) to teach. Also, organized and very helpful.</div></div></div></body></html>
