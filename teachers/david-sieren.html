He gives great feedback on projects and is always willing to sit with you and give you extra helpattention on a project. My 3 hour class flies by because he makes it so fun and enjoyable! He assigns projects that actually help you develop as a designer. It has been 5 weeks and I feel much more confident than I did week 1. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2013<br>Class Name: GD105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>If you're a Graphic Design major, taking David for 105 is a must. As a working designer, he definitely knows what he's talking about and I've never had a teacher as passionate or creative with lectures. The workload is a bit heavy, but it's all relevant and fairly simple. He also gives tests every other week but they aren't too hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2013<br>Class Name: GD105802<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>David is awesome. He's really laid back, keeps lectures interesting, and you can really tell he's passionate about the subject he teaches.  I'm always surprised how quickly the 3 hour class I'm in goes by.  If you're interested in design you'll love his classes, and if you're not, he's probably still your best bet.  His class is actually fun.</div></div></div></body></html>
