Excellent methodologies and instructional suggestions for both regular ed and special education.  Let's definitely get her back next quarter!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2006<br>Class Name: TL416<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I just ran into this professor again as I was student teaching and she provided me with a wealth of real-world clinical and student teaching information that will undoubtedly serve me well in terms of securing a full-time position next summer/fall.  It's great that DePaul has such truly caring instructors.  I would definitely highly recommend her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/05/2006<br>Class Name: TL416<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Got to know her a little, and made sure I kept working hard, and ended up getting a true &quot;total-education&quot; in the process.  Expects alot out of her students -- hard work + integrity.  Enforces said expectations, and does what few profs have the guts to do -- give realistic grades, catches cheating, gives 2nd chances. A++!  Hot too, I'm older (38)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/05/2006<br>Class Name: TL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A remarkably rewarding experience.  Taught me so much about what it is really like to be math teacher in a multi-cultural urban environment.  Connects with students, works hard to keep the grad school classroom as fresh/fun as possible.  Actually teaches the math to us as we should teach the math to students.  Occasionally late, brings chocolates.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/05/2006<br>Class Name: TL416<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>wow...can some people be harsh!!! y'all need to chill -- Ms. Madrecki is a wonderful addition to the DePaul university staff.  She is one of the few teachers i know who will set aside the time to help her students outside of class.  If u work hard, and put forth good work her class will reward you.  she's not mean - she just wants you to work a bit</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2006<br>Class Name: TL<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Comes to class late, unprepared, and speaks negatively about DePaul students. She has good information, however it is impossible to learn from her because she creates such a negative repore with her Adult students, her tatics & personality are her downfall. Definately liability to DePaul School of Ed. (Dr. Cobb is a better choice).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2005<br>Class Name: TL416<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2005<br>Class Name: TL416<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
