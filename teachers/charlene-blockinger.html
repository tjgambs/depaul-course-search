There is also two 10 page papers if you are taking 2 competences due at the end. Great subject, but not worth the stress this class will give you completing everything.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2014<br>Class Name: HC212<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was the worst class I took in four years at DePaul. She does not grade papers fairly and assumes the worst in her students.  I was really interested in the subject, but the instructor was awful in almost every way.  Do. Not. Take. A. Class. With. This. Professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2014<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BEWARE. She is so inflexible and ironically has no interest in communicating with you or clarifying things. Incredibly harsh and unfair grading. Expectations are unclear. One of my worst experiences in all 4 years at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/02/2013<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took her online. Not my favorite class. She is probably better in person. She is not up with all technology and is kind of boring. She seems kind and understanding though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2013<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For someone who is all about helping you understand, she makes no effort in understanding her students, refuses to give examples to clarify our questions, and all of her assignments are unclear until she fails you on them. Great class, not a great teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2012<br>Class Name: LLS445<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had high expectations of professor and course, but it was so bad that I dropped it. 1. Unreasonable homework expectations (quantity and deadlines) 2. Inflexible policies 3. Focused only on int'l cultural dynamics--losing huge engagement opportunity of many students if there had been some incorporation of other aspects of cultural difference.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2012<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Every class she takes attendance and will lower ur grade if u miss alot.

It is boring. It's like watching paint dry.Very difficult to work with. Not a pleasant experience.

She is extremely knowledgeable about the subject and very passionate. Lectures are pretty routine. Same thing discussed with different examples. She did change my overall outlook on certain issues. Very easy grader. Attend class and participation is key.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2010<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She calls attendance, easy grader, really good topics in class for dialogue, she's really nice</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2010<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's SUPER NICE. Very lenient and an easy grader. She's is very knowledgeable about her subject but she's not the greatest teacher if that makes any sense.

Very interested in her topic, which makes the class interesting. Lots of discussion that has totally changed the way I view the world. Quite a bit of reading, but if you don't have time, its okay to just skim enough to participate in the discussions. Highly recommended!</div></div></div></body></html>
