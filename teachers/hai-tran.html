Class was pretty boring though because he spent too much time going over the easy aspects of too many programs, like photoshop and wordpress. He tried t engage the class, but no one would participate, which made it even more boring. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2014<br>Class Name: JOUR363<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a nice guy, and he's clearly passionate about what he teaches. But his lectures are boring, and he's extremely nit-picky about grading. He'll spend maybe 20 minutes teaching you about a brand new program then expect perfection in your assignments. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2013<br>Class Name: JOUR275<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this teacher was horrible for a summer course! There was way too much homework and things we had to do all in one week such as discussion, assignments, quizzes, all which contained like 5 parts each to complete everything. Just way too much work and he doesn't except any late work, so you receive a zero. Seemed like high school with all the work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2012<br>Class Name: JOURN275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best online class I have taken at DePaul. Online lectures and materials were very helpful.Professor Tran was easy to contact and responded quickly to emails and questions with constructive comments. This class did more to improve my writing than any English class I have taken and not at all difficult.Lessons are organized & easy to follow.</div></div></div></body></html>
