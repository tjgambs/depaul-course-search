Really passionate and laid back. Promotes discussion and enjoys listening to students present their writing exercises. Easy assignments. No midterm just a very informal presentation and the final is your own original fiction short story. Highly recommend! Loves making conversation with students on unrelated topics. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class. 10 quizzes but they're really, really easy. I can not explain how easy they are. If you read you'll do fine. Very patient professor who really encourages and respects your viewpoint. The papers are really just your analysis of the reading and aren't too bad. It's pretty cool to write how you feel about the readings. Would take again. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/16/2015<br>Class Name: ENG218<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>The readings are short and there is a quiz every other day to test you, but they are so easy and the readings are really simple. Good discussion in class, promotes participation and likes to hear opinions on the reading. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Engaging class. Funny and interesting lecture. Great teacher, easy grader, easy points if you follow the format for papers and do a little reading. And of course, easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Show up to class and you're good. Papers are not that difficult and neither are quizzes. Readings are doable and entertaining. His lectures are entertaining and he's a fun guy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy A if you are a descent writer w good grammarpunctuation. He's a pretty easy grader and is laidback. He's very helpful if you ask for it, but it prob won't even come to that. There are readings  but u can totally get away wo doing it. No textbooks required. His lectures are long and boring! I doubt you will learn anything at all. gpa booster</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Ramirez is one of the best professors at Depaul! His class is very interesting and engaging and he is a very generous grader! You might have to do readings but they are not exceptionally long, they are easy reads most of the time and showing up to class and being in the discussion is all you need to get an A. Essays are mostly personal. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>This was an extremely easy class and he's a nice guy but he doesn't actually understand anything he is teaching. He has you do a bunch of readings but doesn't understand the concepts himself, except he thinks he REALLY gets it... If you only care about getting a good grade this class is fine, just don't expect to actually learn anything.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I dreaded going into this class; however, Steven was really nice, a good teacher, and very open. He is a little hard to reach sometimes, and can ramble on occasion, but overall he is very enjoyable and probably could not have asked for a better multiculturalism professor. It is a little reading intensive, but it is survivable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2014<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Easiest creative writing class I have ever taken.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a nice guy but you need to read. He gave me an A- which really upset me considering I was well into the A range. His explanation was generic and didn't even apply to me. You have to read in his class. I'll be honest he wasn't for me but is still a takeable teacher if you can get past his performances.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Best LSP 200 class to take! Steve is young, which makes him personable and relatable. There is a heavy amount of readings assigned, but the class is easy overall. Steve is funny and charasmatic and makes the entire class motivated for discussions!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor I've ever met. A couple of essays, a midterm and final. I recommend to anyone that wants to have a good time in class and get a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best down to earth professor at DePaul. He really motivates you to participate. Few writing assignments, midterm and final were essays. I enjoyed his class and him as well. Great professor. 100% Recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2012<br>Class Name: ENG218<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Steve is a great person.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2012<br>Class Name: ENG218<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the best professor's I've had yet at DePaul, he's funny and charismatic and makes me want to show up to class. Plus, he's easy on the eyes. You do have to show up to class, miss two and you lose a letter grade--so I guess that's a negative, but you'll want to show up to this class! I promise! Very Discussion based and informal. FUN!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/29/2012<br>Class Name: ENG291<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This workshop was always so much fun. He is cute, nice and really a great professor. I recommend taking his class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2011<br>Class Name: ENG221<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good class. It was hard but the professor was willing to meet anytime outside of office hours.  He also lets you revise your papers for a higher grade so long as you meet with him, which is awesome.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2011<br>Class Name: ENG221<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>MY problem with Steve is that he is condescending. He says he used to teach 8th grade and I think he still is trying to. He &quot;performs&quot; in class as if we were a group of kids and just makes you feel annoyed. His assignments seemed easy but he wanted all these small things. The essay midterm/final were looking for things he wasnt clear about.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2011<br>Class Name: ENG221<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far the worst class I have taken at DePaul. Listened to the fellow comments and was expecting an awesome teacher but was I fooled. His grading scale is ridiculous 5 out of 5 is only a B in his eyes. Although he is nice to look at, his teaching style is whack. I never understood anything he lectured. Test every week! Paid for a book we didn't use</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/12/2011<br>Class Name: ENG291<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great creative writing professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2011<br>Class Name: ENG291<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Steve is a great guy! He looks like he should be taking the class and yet he's a very intelligent and thoughtful guy when it comes to writing. His workshops were very helpful and interesting and he picked interesting, atypical stories to read which was fun and kept things fresh. All this & he's hot too. If you're into writing, he's a MUST</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2010<br>Class Name: ENG272<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super nice, helpful and clear.
