I read Shakespeare in high school and it was helpful but I still learned in this class. Papers aren't too bad and as long as you understand what she expects, it's pretty easy to get a good grade. Participate in class discussions and you'll get a lot more out of it as well as your grade!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2015<br>Class Name: ENG228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed her class once students started to participate. She really encourages an in-depth discussion about the plays. We would sometimes spend too long on a single passage, but other than that I found the class to be pretty interesting. She's reasonable and fair as long as you put forth effort. You can tell she loves Shakespeare. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2015<br>Class Name: ENG328<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super engaging, challenging, and passionate. Even if you're not a huge Shakespeare fan, her energy and insight will convert you!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2014<br>Class Name: ENG320<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Megan Heffernan rules!!! She gives constructive criticism on the few papers she assigns, she doesn't give much homework at all, just do the readings. And It is a good idea to participate because class is way better when you do and Megan rules so she deserves your effort!!!!</div></div></div></body></html>
