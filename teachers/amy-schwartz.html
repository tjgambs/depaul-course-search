Her assignments aren't too ridiculous, but she'll work with you if you're struggling. She's very laid-back and relaxed, and she usually finishes class early. Would definitely take her again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2015<br>Class Name: GD220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amy only teaches a couple classes here, but she is by far once of the worst professors I've ever had. She is rude to her students, in the way she addresses them with a lack of respect, and she doesn't respond to emails until right before the next class. She's very unprofessional, and her instructions are usually ambiguous. Never again. </div></div></div></body></html>
