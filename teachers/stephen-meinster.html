Five quizes, and three are take homes. No need to purchase the book. You can write midterm again. He is very cool. If you want to do good in the class, go to his class, but attendance is not mendatory. He is not boring at all 4 PHL, he has his own style of teaching, which I think very few PHL teachers have in DePaul.

He gets really off topic, which is fun, but doesn't help when you have to write a paper.  Avoid taking him as a night class, as he only gives the paper out a week ahead of time so you don't have a chance to ask him questions.

I have had at DePaul. Meinster teaches material that can be boring but makes it interesting. He tells tons of stories about his life but they help you understand the material.

Just show up to class, with him its not hard and you will do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2006<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really couldn't ask for a better guy to teach philosophy. I was actually pretty nervous about taking business ethics, but Meinster completely eased my fears by the second week. The class is full of difficult concepts, but go to class and take good notes and you should be fine. Take home midterm/final. You learn A LOT.

His lecture style is very disorganized/random and I just didn't find the classes helpful at all for understanding the reading.  Not bad for a required class- he has good stories-lectures need work</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2004<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a professor! He's good looking AND funny! Not to mention that he's a great teacher who is extremely helpful, and if you do the work, there is no reason you can't get an A. No surprises in this class. Take him if you can!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2004<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cute Professor! I recommend him to everyone. He understands us because he's young and knows how we feel with school. Only two papers (mid and Final) and somwhat some quizzes. Fair and Easy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2004<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>one word for this guy, Saucy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2004<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Steve's pretty cool - Has ZERO fashion sense. Dead ringer for Michael Shanks (Stargate-SG1). As for the material, it's pretty stock classical phiosophy (Plato/Aristotle), but he does a decent job of making it interesting. Even lets you sleep.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2004<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great teacher...has a lot of great stories that relate to what we discuss in class.  five easy quizes and two take home essay exams.  recommended</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2004<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really inspring and thought provoking. Laid back approach to subject matter, and although he jokes about not caring he is probably one of the most concerned and helpful professors. One of the best DePaul has.

Entertaining, down to earth, tries his best to make a boring subject interesting.  Clear approach to teaching business ethics.  Mixes old school theroies (plato, aristotle, smith, marcs) and related to modern society.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2003<br>Class Name: PHL101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a little bit full of sh*t but he's really cute and I got a B after only showing up to half the classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2003<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved this prof. and the class.

Still, it's not that hard to understand if you really try and he's v. repetative, that helps. However, he's more of a preacher than a teacher, likes to talk, doesn't like to have students talk. Ttl: 3.5</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2003<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's really hot and easy to understand.  He can tie in every example he has into his lessons.  There's barely any homework and only a few quizzes.  As long as you pay attention in class, you'll do good in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2003<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really good at relating material.
