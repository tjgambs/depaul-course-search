Wasn't to helpful, never fully stated what she expected and did not really try her best to teach.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2014<br>Class Name: MKT383<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor O'Brien is super cool. She isn't the type to beat around the bush. O'B likes expressing herself openly, & often uses real world-work examples that relate to a "big picture" idea of what Sales Leadership is at DePaul. I would suggest taking MKT 383: how knowledge, emotion, & action come together and constitute a image.

Her grading is very frustrating though. I had no idea what my grade was the entire time. She needs to be more specific in terms of how she plans on grading and how to get an A on assignments. I would recommend though but just a stern warning.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2014<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty bad class. She's nice and all but we had no clue what our grades were until the very day grades were due. She doesn't use D2L to post grades, and her attendance policy is super strict/weird. She also accuses people of texting even when they're just looking down. And just wait till you see how the reflections are graded....</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2014<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Margaret is very good at what she does. Explains everything very clear and the assignments were super easy. She always let us out of class early. The final was a memo explaining what we learned in the class, super easy. Take her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2013<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy class. No midterm or formal final; rather, there is a final memo that takes no time to write. The material is boring, never used the text book once. Follow her directions on assignments and it is an easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2013<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good Professor. I did learn things. Do Not buy the textbook. Will not use it one bit I promise and I got an A. Very easy assignments, its the details that matter, you must follow her directions precisely. Get good group members for very simple/easy project where minute details matter. Do not text in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2013<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Drop the COM class and take MKT instead. The other COM is totally bs. MKT 376 is much easier to breathe. Don't buy the book. Every MKT 376 use the same ppt slides from the department. Keep up with deadline, u'll be fine. Totally recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/22/2012<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the easiest classes ever. One final memo, two group presentations, two or three other little easy assignments.  The instructors is knowledgeable, but extremely boring. Don't carry your book to class, you will hardly use it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2012<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teacher is ok. Kind of moody and annoying at times. One of the easiest classes I have ever taken. No tests and little outside of class work. No final you just tern in a final memo that is easy. I would definitely recommend taking this if you're looking to fill an easy marketing class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2012<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super easy class. Easy grader if you follow directions and her deadlines in the syllabus. Don't buy the book there are no tests on it and she explains all of the material in class through pointless powerpoint slides. Keeps the class involved but can be boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2012<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great prof. She helps during your time in class and after you finish her class.  Keeps your attention and is always willing to help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2012<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was not bad at all. I really enjoyed this class. A few speeches and presentations. maybe like 2 in front of the whole class and they were done in groups. Barely any h.w. Final memo was the toughest assignment which was on a scale of 1-10 (10 being the toughest a 3!! I would definitely take a another course with her. Oh yeah NO TEXTING!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2011<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great person, good teacher. Laid back class that requires not too much effort. Can definitely get an A in this one. It's also enjoyable. Recommend taking it as a night class (usually get out early).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2011<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall a bad teacher.  She rambles on with slides that are common sense and grades harshly on assignments which she does not explain the requirements for.  I think the first reviews she received were from family or friends because I don't see who could enjoy this professor... and dont buy the book if you do decide to take her, there are no tests</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2011<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy material, unclear about expectations and unforgiving grader.  I would recommend not taking her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2011<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The grading is a little harsh and annoying in this class, but I ended up with an A- anyway.  Over all though prof O'Brien was a good professor and helped us out when we asked.  I wouldn't recommend going to the networking mixer though unless you want a job in sales.  The &quot;make-up&quot; assignment is way easier</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2011<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Material of this class is useless for most of the part. She is an easy grader. Follow directions and you will get an A. Also, make sure you attend the classes because there are project in class that are worth a lot. No exams as such.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2011<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was useless, topics were boring and should come easy if you are not a retard. She is full of herself and is not willing to help out students. Missing one class will end up dropping your grade by one letter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2010<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doesn't live up to the reviews here. I'm seriously doubting if she had her relatives write the review on behalf. Wasn't helpful when questions were asked, boring and repetive on the subjects. She actually cut off one of the teams while they were presenting, on purpose, because she wanted to point out they were confusing- very sarcastically done.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2009<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher! You will have so much fun in this class and at the same time you will learn a lot. 2 group projects and a final memo. Every student must take a class with prof. O'Brien!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2009<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, one of the best at DePaul. Engaged in the subject material which allows her to deliver sometimes boring stuff in an interesting funny way. She has great insight, and is willing and glad to help people out if they ask. Cultivates a friendly class environment which lets you get to know classmates and have fun in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2009<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor! she is really helpful. If you came to class and do the little work that she assigns you will get an A! No tests...just a final memo. Class consists of a few in class excercises,2 small group presentations that you dont even have to do actual research for and a final memo which she can help you out with if you ask her. Must take!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2007<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice and down to earth professor, one of a kind. She tells you exactly what she expects from you and actually wants you to do well in her class. Converts the classroom in to a comforting type of ambiance, she's the best professor for Effective Communication. Take her thank me later.</div></div></div></body></html>
