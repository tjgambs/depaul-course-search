He misses many days but wont even let you have one. If you want a good attendance grade you have to go everyday and and answer more questions than he asks during class. Vague feedback on hw and I don't think he ever read the assigned book because when you answer directly from text, only his answer is right, not his.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2015<br>Class Name: HST183<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Beware. He expects you at act in the way that is written on his syllabus and blatantly acts the opposite himself. Grades do not match the comments he makes (gives good grades and rude comments). Attendance is mandatory, even if you're puking. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2014<br>Class Name: 388<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Williams was great.

I wish he had elaborated more on some of the assignments. He'd ask a lot of questions in class and was trying to promote dialogue among the students rather than give away the answer. I'd have no problem taking one of his classes again. He wasn't my favorite but I definitely enjoyed his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2013<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor EVER. He is extremely annoying, has no idea what he's talking about, and doesn't answer anyones questions. He is VERY UNSPECIFIC which made me question his credibility. He assigns papers but never talks about them in class. He is annoying AF, rude, and BORING. I hated his class because of him and how he taught. SO unorganized.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2012<br>Class Name: HST183<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very difficult grader, though he claimed he wasn't on day one.  Very hard to take notes, cause he was always on off-topic tangents.  To study for his essay tests, I had to really learn the material on my own terms, not from his minimal notes.  Lectures are long and boring.  I was really looking forward to History, and felt disappointed.  Avoid!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2011<br>Class Name: HST183<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It was so hard to stay awake in this class. He was disorganized and went on random tangents. So difficult to take notes, as well. Your best bet is to read the text on your own. If you don't already have knowledge of American History, you will be totally lost in this class because he lectures as if you already know the material. Two thumbs down.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/16/2010<br>Class Name: HST183<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Williams was horrible! He is a ridiculously hard grader and his lectures were torture. He goes so far off topic that I did not even know what to take notes on. His powerpoints consisted of about 2 slides for the entire lecture, and I was very disappointed in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2010<br>Class Name: HST183<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Williams' class was very interesting. He kept me enganged in the topics for someone who finds history challenging and boring. The exams weren't very hard, but he was somewhat of a hard grader. I pulled off a B though without opening the text book! :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2010<br>Class Name: HST183<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Williams was very knowledgeable, however he rarely stayed on task with the material.  He would go on tangents and then never get to the vocabulary words for the day which made it hard to study for exams.  Exams were fairly easy.  One essay and four vocab words to write about.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2009<br>Class Name: HST183<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It was a very boring class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2009<br>Class Name: HST183<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Williams is a talker and goes on tangents about things that are not relevant to what we are learning in class. He is very biased towards certain subjects as well. Work is very straight forward: 2 tests and 2 papers. I would not recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2009<br>Class Name: HST282<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm sorry but this man is a hard grader.

Was insightful on our tours on immersion week. Best discover teacher by far. Went way over budget on our lunch breaks. I was scared about this class, was one of the last choices but ended up changing my view on the city and made me think about sociology degree</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2008<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE HIS DISCOVER CLASS!! I'm sure he's great for other history classes, but he makes the adjustment from high school to college harder than it has to be. There are only 2 papers and 1 group project and he's SUCH A HARD GRADER!! He's such a nice guy, but his charm is not worth the stress or struggle for an A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2008<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he made an interesting topic extremely boring. he literally talks for two hours straight. Race, politics, and housing in Chicago should have been the most interesting class, but he made it the worst. he does not care if you understand the material or not.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2008<br>Class Name: HST282<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My favorite professor at Depaul.

He has a cute Arkansas accent that makes listening to him more fun!  He is kind of a hard grader though, but there are only two papers, a midterm and a final.  He gives you GREAT study guides for the tests as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2007<br>Class Name: HST386<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>kick ass teacher. not easy but is very passionate about the subject and makes classes very interesteing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2007<br>Class Name: HIST282<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>1. Don't buy the required book, he is great at presenting material to class, not once did i get a B on his midterm nor a test! He is very interesting and funny. Great sense of humor and very helpful.

He does require some thinking, but it's pretty easy to get an A if you attend the class and study a little!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2007<br>Class Name: ISP100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>B-Dubs was a blast during my chicago quarter. He obviously loves his job, and though he was probobly a little different in my class than his usual classes, he connected really well with his students. However, he can be vague(purposely) to the point of confusion, and is definitly a hard grader- great guy though</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2007<br>Class Name: HST282<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this guy. He made class fun and interesting. Has a great sense of humor and tells great stories. Only one paper to write, and he is a pretty easy grader on exams. Books are hardly used at all, though they come in handy on exams. Take good notes and you'll be fine. Start losing points on grade after one miss however.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2007<br>Class Name: HST282<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher.

Williams is a fair grader although sometimes alittle easy.  He did a very good job in trying to keep the class interesting. Class had a lot of information but he didn't force you to know everything. As long as you write good papers based with a good understanding on what he is asking then you should do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2006<br>Class Name: HST282<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Its a decent class, he doesn't use the book at all, the mid-term and final are essay, definitions, and objective.

He always had time to go over papers with me and if you participate in class he does give you extensions. He's also one of the funniest professors I have. Great prof!

He's clear, and percise on what he expects, and if you're still confused just ask. Books are helpful and interseting. They are a good example of the theory.

Well prepared lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2004<br>Class Name: HISTORY<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Williams is my favorite teacher at DePaul, i dont care if he is a little hard, when all is said and done he gave me the kind of education i felt i went to college for in the first place.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2004<br>Class Name: HON103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Williams is a good teacher and although he can be challenging at times, he is very reasonable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2004<br>Class Name: HISTORY<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2004<br>Class Name: HST<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very funny and nice guy. i learned a lot in his class. paper was easy. tests were kind of difficult, essay portion at least. id take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2004<br>Class Name: HST280<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice man, however, very HARD grader.Tries to start class participation, however, he always ends up talking throughout the whole class period.Do not go to class sleepy, because he will totally put you to sleep.I find it impossible to keep my eyes open</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/29/2004<br>Class Name: HST280<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want to have your head buried in a book--take him.
