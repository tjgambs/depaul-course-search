He is very detailed and expects a lot out of you. You read two books that are quite enjoyable and write a total of 5 short essays. It's not an easy A, but if you do the work you'll get a good grade. Great Professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/24/2012<br>Class Name: ABD208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amor Kohli was one of my BEST professors at DePaul.

You'll definitely learn alot and he keeps class super interesting. You won't WANT to ever miss a class. Work isn't too hard or abundant, but he does expect a lot from you and to live up to your potential. Just do the work and you'll do fine. One of the best teachers at DePaul for sure.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2010<br>Class Name: ABD235<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's definitely a LEGIT teacher.  A very soulful guy and is very well read in what he teaches.  He is a hard grader and expects top notch work but if you at least read enough and really focus on the lectures you'd be good for the most part</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2010<br>Class Name: HON205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class discussions! Understanding if you miss a class or turn an assignment in late as long as you let him know and explain what is going on and ask for an extension on the assignments. Homework consists of a lot of reading and analyzing novels, but very helpful in explaining.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2009<br>Class Name: ABD235<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Kohli gives interesting lectures.  He asks the class to answer questions instead of always talking. He is a pretty easy grader, given that you do the work and show that some effort was put into it.  Only two formal papers the entire quarter; pop quizzes on readings and requires online posts.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2008<br>Class Name: ISP104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor I have had thus far at DePaul. I had him for a Langston Hughes focal point, and I learned more not only about Langston Hughes, but his poetry, life, and the social movement of the time.  There is a lot of reading and writing, but you learn tons. Take Kohli for sure. He's even helped me with projects in other classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2007<br>Class Name: ENG111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>smart, fun, and HOT.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/14/2007<br>Class Name: ABDSECT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jazz and the Diasporic Imagination: Even for those not interested in the topic, professor Kohli provides readings and insight so all can participate in discussion and excel in course work.

Good sense of humor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2007<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>African American literature in Chicago: Kohli was okay.  I did not enjoy the topic all that much, plus it was a four hour class which was horrible!!!  (dont take a four hr class, esp. if it is a boring subject!!!)

He lectures, but mostly asks questions aimed at testing your knowledge of the topics at hand. Towards the end of the quarter, his questions seem vague because he expects the class to have knowlwedge enough of the material to ask and answer all the right questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2005<br>Class Name: SOPHSEMINAR<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is very interesting. He does not give you an answer. He makes you figure it out on your own and if it just sounds good then you will get a good grade. The only thing that is a little much are the bogus reflections you write about once or twice a week after reading. Just make it sound good as long as it sounds good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2005<br>Class Name: BLACKSTUDIES<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, dont come to him with trite clichés.

Some of the readings you can find on spark notes but most of them you have to do on your own.  He is a very easy grader and gives you many chances to boost your grade.  He also really likes to talk and see you outside of class around campus.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2004<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very fair grader...as long as you involve yourself in the discussions and can write a decent paper-you will be fine and get an A.

Yeah, it's a lot of reading, but what do you expect...it's cross-listed as an English class, too. If you register for the class, you must be aware that it's a LITERARY class--you know, reading&#63;&#63;&#63; Anyway, really great class, so glad I took it, would definitely take him again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2004<br>Class Name: ABD<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a pretty cool teacher. Alot of reading, but we talk about it during class during our discussions. Discussions are cool, but he can be pretty unclear at times.

Knows a lot about black lit/history. Initially the discussions were excellent, but they started to lose some of their stamina, as his questions became more and more vague and confusing. But all in all, take his class only if u love 2 read and can handle serious reading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2004<br>Class Name: ABD245<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher, makes students interested in the readings.
