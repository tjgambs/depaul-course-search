I need a large redbull everyday in order to just stay awake. She becomes upset over the smallest instances. Everyone who says she is a good teacher are severely mistaken.  She takes a hundred level class as if it were the most important thing in the world. The midterm honestly is a two hour test and we only have a hour.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2009<br>Class Name: HAA238<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Love her! She is so helpful and sweet, basically tells you everything thats going to be on the Midterm/Final. There are readings from the book, but not often. I did not use the book AT ALL so save your money. Take her class she rocks!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2009<br>Class Name: ART200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>most boring class @ depaul</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2009<br>Class Name: ART249<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Galpin's an amazing person. She's very passionate about the topic area and will be thorough about what will be on the exam. TAKE GOOD NOTES, visit the Musuem of Mexican Art, study slide I.Ds, DON'T BUY THE TEXTBOOK; you won't even use it. Overall; fun class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2008<br>Class Name: ART249<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Galpin is a really sweet lady.  If you come to class, take notes, and participate you will do fine.  I did not do any homework outside of class just alot of memorizing before the midterm and final.  Never used textbook.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2008<br>Class Name: ART249<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of memorization in this class, attendance is mandatory. midterm, paper, final,museum visit, and 2 extra credit assignments.She is not a hard grader as long as you pay attention and DON'T text during class (don't even look at your cell phone, this really irritates her).4 slide identifications, 3 short answers and an essay on midterm and final</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2008<br>Class Name: ART249<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Itis so hard to concentrate in her class bc her beauty takes your breath away.  Easy class just got to memorize some paintings for the midterm and final.  Other than that all you have to do is a little research paper and you are set.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2007<br>Class Name: ART111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She cool.  Show up, take notes, study the slide id's.  When she goes on a lot about a piece of art , that is the one that will be on the exam.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2006<br>Class Name: LST298<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great professor.  very knowledgable and helpful.  i would definitly take her again</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/09/2006<br>Class Name: LATINART<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As a Latin American studies minor, I expected more out of this class. I was very dissapointed in that she didn't speak to the historical point of the art in terms of the social impact that the art had in the lives on the natives.  I was very upset to have wasted one of my few chances to learn about the culture.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2006<br>Class Name: ART335<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amy is a great teacher. she knows a lot about the subject and goes beyond the art to concepts and frameworks in a way that is interesting sometimes funny . She is really understanding and helps her students a lot outsid of class. She requires two papers two exams and a presentation...which is a lot but I learned more from this class than any other</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/11/2005<br>Class Name: ART243<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She had an incredable sense of humor and had a knack to draw her students in o what she was saying. Latin American history will never be the same after taking her. A +</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2005<br>Class Name: LATINAMERIART<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She knows very much about her subject but doesnt act like it. I would have taken the class and her more seriously if she had more confidence and was more authoritative.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2005<br>Class Name: ART243<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was an amazing teacher, especially for her first class ever.  Incredibly knowledgeable on the subject matter and unafraid to look at the art from many different angles.  Great teacher and class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2005<br>Class Name: ART243<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought that she had much knowledge on her subject and she really tried to help her students.  She took the time out to talk to us individually and is extremely nice.  She does offer some work, but it's not that hard if you just pay attention.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/24/2005<br>Class Name: ART243<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is great! read and be in class and you will do good. she explains very well and is very helpful. she is a great human being.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/25/2004<br>Class Name: ART243<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great prof!
