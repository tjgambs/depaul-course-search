The material is interesting but can get a little repetitive at times. Quizzes are pretty simple if you paid attention to the readings. Writing assignments are a little weird because you have to do different exercises that basically amount to stalking people. Strange choice for a communication class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2015<br>Class Name: RELC319<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Bryant is amazing! She is very helpful. Her assignments are interesting and helpful in learning about personal relationships. Love to talk about research and areas of RELC. She is very open and friendly and really knew how to engage the class in discussions. Definitely appreciates when you participate in class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2015<br>Class Name: RELC319<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bryant is one of the most dynamic lecturers at DePaul and I would highly recommend that anyone in Relational Communication or any student with an open elective take her for the Dark Side course.   She is passionate about the content and is always super prepared.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/15/2013<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked her, and she's funny, but she's not clear on what she expects. Midterm was awful! She only taught the first half of CMN 101 so I was relieved to have Jaime the second half. She's a nice lady, but not the best teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2013<br>Class Name: COM101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At first I hated her! She went off on tangents and I was really confused on what she was exactly testing us on. But as the class progressed she got a little better.. but not by much. She isn't very clear on what you'll be tested on for the midterm.. SO STUDY STUDY STUDY everything and anything... the test was difficult...case study.. not so much.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2013<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bryant seems great at first but is too into telling you about herself. She spends more time ranting about her cats than actually telling you what you need to know. Our midterm, which was supposed to be super easy, was very hard. The average in my class was a 70% whereas other classes had an average of 88% in the same quarter. I wouldn't take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2013<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her for CMN101 and i thought that she was great! she always provided examples to real life situations to help us understand the concepts. she wasnt very clear on what she wanted on the exams so you basically have to take really good notes. other than that she is great and i would recommend her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2013<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I also had Leah for my Discover Chicago class first quarter, and I love how she teaches! She teaches the information in such a scientific way that it isn't as awkward to discuss. If you ask her a question, she answers honestly. She gets really excited and is enthusiastic about what she's teaching and it makes me look forward to learning the topics!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/03/2012<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a really nice and sweet. Attendance was mandatory because it was a discover Chicago class, but I didn't mind going because she made it very interesting and she really wants you to learn. She is a pretty easy grader if you do the requirements and add a little more to it.  She's very clear about what she wants so its fine. I recommend her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2011<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her intro to comm was literally the worst. She was unnecessarily harsh grading after her class I retook turned in the same work and got an A from a C. She isn't helpful and lectures are very disorganized. Too many anecdotes and Jersey Shore references, made class unbearable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2011<br>Class Name: CMNS319<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It looks like the + ratings havent taken a comm class past 101. She doesnt teach with the student in mind. She just talks at u its up to the student to guess what she wants on tests then she is shocked when u dont give her exactly what she wants! Dont bother asking Qs she'll just ignore it if she doesnt like ur Q. I would avoid her at all costs.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2011<br>Class Name: DRK319<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take this course if you do not absolutely love and believe in this subject matter.  She presents everything as absolute fact and manages class time poorly so that she does not cover every topic that is on the very difficult exams.  She is not a fair or reasonable grader.  Avoid this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2011<br>Class Name: CMNS319<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just as the person below me said, only take her if it's for 101.  For dark side, we had a very hard essay form midterm exam (that everyone had to rewrite since they did badly) and a HUGE research project that takes a lot of work ALL quarter long. She's a fair grader.  Project is interesting and worth the pay off if you really like comm.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2009<br>Class Name: COM200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>if youre not going to take her for 101... id say watch out.  anything beyond 101 will be a great learning experience, but with a LOT of research work that will make you want to die. literally. no joke,  extreme caution.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2009<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Leah is totally awesome.  She was definitely one of my favorite professors.  In a huge lecture classroom she was so effective in engaging the whole class.  The material was easy, but I still learned quite a bit from her!  I highly recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2009<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Bryant was an AMAZING teacher. You can tell she really loves her job and enjoys sharing her knowledge with students. She only taught for half of the quarter and I legitimately missed her the second half!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/26/2009<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a joke. For one she ordered the book from some shop off campus and it was not ready for pick up till two weeks in. She was rude and confrontational when asked about it. She also is sarcastic if you ask a question she does not like. My be funny but with no respect it makes the class a waste. Take another teacher if you ask questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/08/2009<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Leah is the funniest teacher at DePaul.I only went to like one class and it was hands down the best lecture I've ever received in my 3 years at DePaul. She gives an amazing lecture on the dark side of communication and how people deal with death. DONT miss it. Pretty easy graded, but you CANNOT be late on the paper. SHE WILL TAKE MAJOR POINTS OFF.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2008<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super nice and really funny.  That being said, her expectations aren't really laid out.  She claimed that the final was going to be &quot;a piece of cake&quot; when in reality it wasn't.  Read the book...and not just the plain text, read all of those colored boxes and &quot;fun facts&quot; too because they may or may not be on the final.  All in all she's alright.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2008<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Leah is a wonderful professor.  She is so intelligent and her lectures truly reflect that fact.  I looked forward to going to class everytime because I knew I would leave with new knowledge.  She bases her final on both the book and the lecture, but if you study and attend class, it will be fine.  I got a 100%!  Highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2008<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's entertaining, and you can learn a lot from her, but she doesn't make her expectations very clear. I was 20 minutes late for a 9:40am midterm and she wouldn't let me take it because one student had finished and left (2 MINUTES BEFORE). She said the test was 'unsecured'. It was 1/3 of my grade during a summer class. I had to drop it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2007<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hilarious! Lectures were very entertaining! Wish I could have her for all of CMN 101 instead of the split of teachers! Defintely take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2007<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is hillarious! Absolutely amazing! You leave class in a good mood. For her half of the quarter you have an analysis and an exam. Exam covers both lectures and textbook, but if you read and come to class, you won't have any problems (I got a 94%).She is always willing to help. I would take her again for sure!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2006<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of people had a problem with the final, but I didn't think it was the end of the world. Make sure to review all of the reading. She doesn't go over it all in class but it's still on the test (which she curves). Really interesting lectures, but it's true they're filled with a lot of useless info. Overall really helpful though. I recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/10/2006<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just like everyone says, she's got some very interesting material and she does make some odd jokes about things.   I've been able to leave class with so much trivia to bore my friends with, making me feel confident about the class material...but then when test time came, i felt like i might as well not have shown up to class because i had NO IDEA w</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2006<br>Class Name: 101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I found her to be the most annoying person I have ever encountered.  The most infuriating part was that people encouraged her by laughing at her stupid tangents and &quot;jokes.&quot;  She thinks she is funny and &quot;hip,&quot; but really is not at all.  The topics in class were interesting, but her tests were hard and didnt pertain to lecture. Super annoying woman!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2005<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All I have to say is in the beginning of the class you get a lecture about how a C really isn't a bad grade. BOO!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2005<br>Class Name: CMN211<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She gave really good lectures, but when it was time for a test that didn't really matter. You must must must read the book, most of the content was taken from the book even though we never discussed it in class. I was never bored, but this one will require a lot of outside work. But it's college. So. You'll have that.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2005<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't ask about the dog.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2005<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>dude, class is SO worth it. shes SO entertaining and hillarious.  shes interesting and her jokes and ideas pertain to class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a very nice and funny woman.

DO IT!! I didnt like her! She is the only CMN prof that doesnt cover material in the book, for a 100 level course her exams are hard. She teaches her own material and profs should not be doing that, she should be teaching from the book. I took summer I can only imagine what the full qtr would be like</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2005<br>Class Name: CMN211CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is funny and very entertaining prof. HOWEVER....YOU HAVE TO READ AND KNOW THE TEXT  Everything that you will be tested on in both of these classes requires knowing and understanding the text because she DOES NOT go over the text.  If you want an A, I suggest reading and re-reading the text and knowing how to apply it.Don't count on her lectures</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2005<br>Class Name: CMN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a funny, intelligent, and interesting person, and her classes are never dull.

She didn't really follow the syllabus, however, but gave informative and entertaining lectures. She is very outgoing and wants people to talk in class. I had fun and learned a lot.

She canceled 3 classes, let us out early the rest of the time, lectured ONE time, syllabus was ALL wrong, and yet her demands for US were really high.
