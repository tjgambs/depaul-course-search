In papers, write what she wants you to and ask her if you don't know what she wants. The lectures are boring and long so make sure your phone is charged to keep you entertained. Find a good group too or the class could be hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/15/2008<br>Class Name: MKT377<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible!

Her papers consist of &quot;opinions&quot;, yet she takes off points, WTF&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2007<br>Class Name: MKT377<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sticher is so easy. There is one test and 2 papers. You have to be an idiot not to get an A. Show a little interest, talk to her after class and you will get an A...if not perhaps you shouldnt be in the marketing field..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2007<br>Class Name: MKT377<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She assumes everyone in the class dreams to be a salesman, so she gears the class towards how to be a good salesman.  All assignments and papers are 100% subjective and her grading is strange, so if you don't understand what's going on in her red head, you won't do good.  Annoying accent, and again assumes everyone wants to be a salesman like her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2007<br>Class Name: MKT398<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really easy but the class is sooooooo boring to sit through and she never lets you out early...so be prepared to be there for the whole 3 hours.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2007<br>Class Name: MKT398<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So easy. Do not buy a book, you will not open it once.  1 little test all from the powerpoint presentation and it's common sense, 1 main project and it's sooo easy.  Good teacher, however, if u have a 3 hr class, u may get bord but overall EASY.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/17/2007<br>Class Name: MKT398<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This trick gets on my nerve. She counts attendance and every other week, there's a company presentation. 50% of the time Target will show up. I put a lot of work into my group project. Just make sure you have people in your group willing to do work. Tests and papers and easy as hell. She gave me a B+ because I left and hour early 1DAY!!! TRICK!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2006<br>Class Name: MKT398<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is not bad. But participation is very important. Make sure you talk a lot otherwise she will take off a letter grade down.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2006<br>Class Name: MKT398<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great teacher, very easy to understand and EAZY A -- Take her before everyonr else does.
