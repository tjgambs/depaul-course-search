Very long and boring lectures makes it very hard to be engaged in the material. Tests are curved but still hard. Be ready to do a lot of studying on your own because he does not do a effective job of preparing you for exams. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2015<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably one of the hardest professors.

He does pretty good at introducing every material but the h.w are not nearly close to the exams. Here is my advice to do well! Read the book do all h.w's in each chapter, but most importantly a good month before exam go online find all practice exams for similar class in different schools like 10 of them and practice !</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2014<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very lazy and basically just reads the textbook to the class.

He taught the class directly from the text and the course grade was determined only by the midterm and final exams. It wasn't a difficult class, but the tests required some solid studying.  After the fact, he put a slight curve on each test.  Personally, he is a friendly guy who is easy to get along with.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/05/2012<br>Class Name: ACC303H<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Only a midterm and a final, optional homework but if you want to do well you have to do it. Tests were relatively hard but he would always be reasonable about grades. If you put a lot of effort you can get an A, if you only do a little you'll probably end up with a B.  He was always very precise and clear and would go over anything if you needed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2012<br>Class Name: ACC303H<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was great.

Read the book before lectures and after lectures.  Do the homework assignments before class. He uses questions from the CPA exam.  They are difficult and I would recommend studying a full week in advance.  Cramming the night before is a nightmare and impossible-i tried it.

Ace the midterm (40%) or else you're out. The exams are hard, which is why he curves. Nice guy for the most part, I didn't find him very helpful. You can't pass this class by cramming 3 days before the test. If youre in Strobels good luck. Get with a study group if necessary.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2010<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, will often show you shortcuts, and explain how he got there, so the textbook's methods are more supplemental, if unnecessary. It is hard to stay awake just because its accounting, but he does inject a good amount of humor, so its not too bad. Take him, he is awesome.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2010<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He has a dry sense of humor, but he is a very funny, very quirky guy. That definitely helped when I was taking this class over the summer. The content is really dry, but he stays up beat. I wouldn't recommend taking ACC 555 over 5 weeks though. He covers a lot of material, but if you stay on top of the work, you will likely be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2009<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He likes to write &quot;challenging exams&quot; and then grade on a curve. Will take the time to answer questions.  The only thing I found strange was when we were going over the midterm, we weren't allowed to have any books on the table or chairs.  I took this class during the summer so it moved quickly.  Pay attention in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2009<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The course itself is hard and kind of dull. But McCarthy is a good professor. He gives good explanations and doesn't give tricky questions during tests. Your grade is based only on midterm and final(cumul), which sucks.

Accounting is awful, and he pretty much admits up front that he knows none of us care about the subject and won't be accountants, so he doesn't try to shove a bunch of CPA stuff down your throat.
