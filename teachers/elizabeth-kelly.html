Expects absolute perfection. Quizzes were simple and discussions were fun. But I would avoid based on paper feedback alone. You can do rewrites on the papers, but I'm not sure why you would.

Yeah, she let's you rewrite papers, but the feedback she gives on the first draft is so bad and incredibly rude and inappropriate.

Extremely rude feedback, has a terrible teaching method. Assigns assignments that are pointless  questions and expects you to write at least 4 pages on them, which is not possible.

She is strict, but she knows her stuff, and is more accessible than most professors. If you do the work and pay attention you'll do well.

Turns out she's not the one who can demotivate you pretty easy. She takes it personal at some point. If you have the same view point to her, you will be fine. Otherwise, drop it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Kelly was awesome. She made research papers fun with the way in which we got to write them. She was always helpful, sure she's a tough grader but she wants you to do well. Her lectures are short and the movies are interesting. Sure the readings are long but that's nothing. I would definitely recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't understand all these hateful comments on her! She's never been rude, or degrading but this is an online class and I can't say anything about how she acts in person. She's not a difficult grader as along as you follow her instructions. Work load is average, and simple. For an online LSP requirement, I'd take her class again. No complaints!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2013<br>Class Name: PSC369<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the worst professor I have ever had at DePaul. She belittles and laughs at students in class. If you do not agree with her opinions you are going to get a bad grade. The class consists of written reviews of the readings. She says you can include your own opinions but your opinions better be the same as hers. Simply is a bad professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2012<br>Class Name: PSC369<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Beth Kelly is a fascinating teacher.  I have taken multiple courses with her, and have learned so much.  She is by far the best professor I have taken at DePaul, and I recommend her to everyone.  Her teaching ability is superior, but she is very particular on how she grades papers.  She allows rewrites, so just pay attention to her suggestions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2012<br>Class Name: PSC363<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I will NEVER take another course from this woman. She is degrading and rude to her students, a hard grader, and it's almost impossible to get an A. True, you can rewrite any assignment, but if she doesnt feel you've made "SUBSTANTIAL" changes, your grade will remain the same. I should have dropped this class when I had the chance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2012<br>Class Name: PSC312<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was incredibly rude when asking her with help about the papers.  She wrote me back an e-mail that completely blew me away because of how rude it was when I was simply asking her for help.  I would NEVER recommend taking her to anyone.  The email was completely insulting and uncalled for.  I showed it to numerous faculty and they were disgusted.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2012<br>Class Name: PSC363<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't know what the person below me's problem is, but Beth Kelly is one of the best professors I've had at DPU. There are unlimited, you heard me right unlimited, re-writes. Seriously, you have to try harder to fail that to get and A. I would absolutely recommend her if you're thinking about going to law school because you brief cases.

Not only is she knowledgeable, but she is very fair. Unlimited rewrites on your papers until you get the grade YOU want, and will meet with you to guide you. This is a professor who makes it possible for you to learn and succeed. Don't take her if you have a chip on YOUR shoulder.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2011<br>Class Name: WGS330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Beth Kelly is an amazing professor.

On the other hand, she is very precise in what she is looking for, but most of the times it is very unclear as to what she wants.

I would not recommend </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2010<br>Class Name: WOMEN216<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely picks favorites in class and even though she lets you do rewrites on papers, she grades very hard and is extremely picky.

Also a bit rude, keeping in mind that our tuition pays her salary.  But hey, she knows her stuff, and she loves sharing her knowledge with her students. Don't show up late; she gets a bit testy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2009<br>Class Name: LGQ150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Beth Kelly is by no means an easy professor.

I took her over the summer session for Sex & Power in US Politics.  There was a bit of reading, but we watched films every class that went over the readings.  There were 3 papers (worth 30% each) and participation was 10% of the grade. She grades her papers fairly and allows re-dos. If you have the chance, TAKE HER CLASS!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2008<br>Class Name: LGQ150<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree wholeheartedly, this woman is a living textbook.

She demands asks that everyone has done the reading and prepared questions before class.  There are 6 mini essays, 1 longer 5-7 pg essay, and a final project.  Much of the criticism expressed here is unfounded.  If you do the reading and participate you'll do great.  She taught writing so submit quality papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/08/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor I have ever had!  Created the account just for this class.  I took the class almost a year ago and it still bothers me to this day.

Professor Kelly is amazing at explaining confusing material and spending as much time on a subject as the class needs.

Two-faced, for sure. Re-writes are abound, but offers little in constructive commentary unless you reiterate her talking points.  Otherwise it's a great course with a lot of new detail and PLENTY to learn.  If you have testicles, you'd better be a feminist: OR ELSE!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2005<br>Class Name: PSC328<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's an awesome Professor!

Interesting and funny. Assigns a lot of reading but she lets you do unlimited rewrites so there's no reason for you not to do well in her class.

I loved her interest in the topic and her general concern to keep her students interested as well.  I went to every class, because each one was a great experience - discussions, critical thinking.
