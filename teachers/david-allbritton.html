He's an easy grader as long as you write a decent amount in for the discussions. He does say if you turn it in earlier, you will be graded easier.  For my class, that was not true, I received all my points regardless if it was done a week before it was due or a day before it was due. Highly recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2015<br>Class Name: 120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>This professor lacked common linguistic knowledge, his online teachings were vague to say the least, and he really doesn't help you as much as he tells you you're wrong. AVOID!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2014<br>Class Name: PSYCH102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good teacher, had information clearly outlined and if you contributed weekly he was fair teacher. Easy to earn extra credit in this class stay ahead of the work and it's a very interesting and easy class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2014<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Seriously the worst teacher I've had yet. I took his class online and I DO NOT suggest taking him. He gives you due dates but wants them to be turned in early or else you will receive a low grade... I have other classes to worry about so I can't put all of the busy work this class is first. He's not helpful and he made me hate psychology. DONT TAKE</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2013<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take this online.  Too much group discussion (multiple questions and responses per week) , online group projects (yes, online group project! why?!)  Fluctuating due dates.  not a great experience.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2011<br>Class Name: PSY360<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Heavy course load in addition to a difficult class. It is possible to get an A, but expect a lot of late nights. This is basically a class for weeding out psych majors. That being said, he is helpful and makes the content interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2011<br>Class Name: PSY360<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The first couple of weeks can be hard with adjusting to the work load.  If you do the work well, however, it is absolutely possible to get an A. The only truly hard part is the online quizzes. Otherwise, it's easy but A LOT of work in general.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2011<br>Class Name: PSY360<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Indeed, he is a good teacher. In my experience with his online course it was overwhelming. Hours+Hours of weekly discussions, etc. CogNeur concentrations take along with easier courses!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2011<br>Class Name: PSY360<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Allbritton is a good professor. You will definitely learn a lot but be prepared, you will work a lot too. There are a ton of assignments every week for the online section so if you're already taking a heavy course load, steer clear of this class. You will be overwhelmed by the amount of work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2011<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't buy any of these negative reviews, sorry. Professor Albritton is fantastic as professors go-he's passionate, knowledgeable and has a sense of humor. His class required a lot of work, but it's college!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2010<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher! I took an online class. The key to get an A is to complete all the assignments on time and read carefully directions for the assignments. His lectures and assignments were very interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2010<br>Class Name: PSY351<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy, willing to help and answer questions. He's a quiet speaker for the big lecture halls but I have passed his tests with A+'s and gotten A's on every paper. His study guide is what is on the test and if you come to class and pay attention and you fail, I'd have to say you must be impaired.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2009<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took as many of Dr. A's classes as I could many years ago when I was an undergrad at DePaul. Years later, I'm pursuing my doctorate in clinical psychology at another institution, but still feel he was one of the best, most helpful and witty professors I have ever had!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2007<br>Class Name: PSY360<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is really a difficult and unfair teacher. I really am not one to complain but I can't help it here. Please shy away from taking Cognitive Psychology with him! Studying for his tests is impossible and his lectures are not related to any of the assigned material. He doesn't even go over the readings!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2007<br>Class Name: COGPSY<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a good teacher but does not rely on the book for his class. Therefore, it is very difficult to study for his tests. Wikipedia helped me study because when I had study questions he was out of town and not responding to emails! Right before the Midterm! I did not like this class AT ALL. Very difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His class wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. The discussions were less than exciting and tended to make me fall asleep. Not a bad class, easy (but long) homework, helpful but boring professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not very clear on the material and not very helpful. He is nice enough, but I would not recommend taking his (quant) class unless you know the stuff already. If you need help you are better off asking one of the lab assistants, as they are easier to understand.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2005<br>Class Name: ADVANCEDCOG<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Allbritton is defintley a PSY teacher that somehow got stuck teaching Quant. Reasoning. Keeping that in mind, he's a good guy who got stuck teaching a class he didn't want to teach. He's very helpful, although he doesn't really know or care about the material that much. Keep on good terms with him, and he'll help you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2005<br>Class Name: PSYCH<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/04/2005<br>Class Name: LEARNTHEORIES<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.

But if you miss one or two quizzes, it counts in the end.  If you do go to class, semi-boring.  Not a bad prof. when it come to teaching the material, just kind of bland.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2005<br>Class Name: RESEARCHMETHOD<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm sorry but I hated Allbritton. He's obsessed with his own work. Is a very smart but arrogent guy. Makes his TA do everything. Didn't even show up to the final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2005<br>Class Name: PSY404<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lovably awkward.  If you're a grad student taking one of his classes, just show up in body and prepare to regurgitate.  He presents the material well, but teaches the grad students the same way he teaches the undergrads.  Nice enough guy and clear in his presentations.  Just a boring class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: RESEARCHMETH<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>first off let me say OBSESSED WITH HIS OWN ARTICLES THAT WERE PUBLISHED. but an alright teacher..some pop quizes and the midterm is not as hard as he makes it sound..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2004<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>David is interesting, but hands out random pop quizes to make sure you are coming to class. A lot was covered on the mid-term, and was pretty confusing. Not too much homework, only 3 papers the whole time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2004<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good teacher, explains everything, and tries to make sure that everyone knows what is going on.
