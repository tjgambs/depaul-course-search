My only problem was the exams. The exams are on the slides, and only the slides and can be VERY specific. My suggestion - in class (or out of) take notes on every slide - I'm not kidding - and if you look them over before the test you'll probably get a A/B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/20/2006<br>Class Name: GPH211<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's really nice and helpful but the photoshop stuff can get complicated and it's hard to be creative when you don't really know what you're doing</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2006<br>Class Name: GPH211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy was cool and relaxed. just do the projects well and read this powerpoint slides and u will do good in the exams. fun class!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2006<br>Class Name: GPH211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jerry is a great professor!
