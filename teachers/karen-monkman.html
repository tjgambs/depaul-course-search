Dr. Monkman provides a lot of insightful readings and articles for each class. She is willing to meet outside of the class and provides great feedback. I thought she would be a tough grader, but she is not. Lectures are long, but I learned a lot from her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2012<br>Class Name: SCG527<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. monkman is one of the best professors at DePaul.

She is demanding, but not unreasonable. I most appreciated her detailed feedback on papers: she asked many follow-up questions and suggested further research, which is perfect for those of us who are thinking about thesis topics.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2007<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>too many assignments and not enough time to do them. no time given in the 3 hours class period to work on group projects.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2006<br>Class Name: SCU207<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this was one of the worst classes i have had at depaul.  ther is so much reading and not enough time in the world to do it.  The topics were interesting, but overly drawn out to the point where it gets extremely boing.  Three or four books are required as well as countless articles that you are responsible to print out. Gets very expensive!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: SCU207<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class, there is a lot of work but it is worth it.  She has no problem with explaining things if you don't understand an assignment. Always willing to go the extra mile if you need it.  Great Teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2006<br>Class Name: SCU207<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She assigns a lot of readings. The 2nd day of class we had a quiz. But she grades fairly easy. Not a blow off class. Can get away with not readin some of the million articles. Overall, interesting class. Enjoyed it. And she was SUPER helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2006<br>Class Name: SCU207<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice teacher but focuses to much on the statistics. A lot of reading and quite a few papers. You have to do fieldwork and at least three group projects. Not bad overall though. Somewhat tough.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2005<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Many group projects and an unreasonable amount of reading for a 10 week class.  Very nice person but teaches from a very anthropologic perspective and focuses on studies more than real experience.</div></div></div></body></html>
