The class I took was online once a week with homework, tests and quizzes online. The online system is great and it helps students solve things they didn't get. I didn't learn a lot in lectures but that's okay because I did okay. Good class for kids who don't like math </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2015<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Chin is completely all over the place in his lecture. He just relies on mymathlab and that I ended up teaching the material myself. I wouldn't say he doesn't teach, but he doesn't know how to teach clearly. All of the quizzes, midterm, and final are online. But, you can find better.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2014<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst math teacher I have had in my  life. Very confusing and hard to follow him. Gives unclear answers-at best- when you do ask a question. The book and tutoring center saved me. Quizzes every week, mostly in MyLabsPlus but some in class. Final  worth 36% and midterm 27% sucked. Jumped through hoops to barely earn a B. You could find better!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2014<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awful teacher.

If you are decent with logic problems and probability you will have no problem earning an A.  If you are not very math oriented however he will not waste time catching you up. That being said he's one of the wittiest professors here and should be spending his time back in Vegas counting cards. Total Genius.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2013<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He knows his material, makes a lot of smarty humor jokes that most classes are too brain dead to notice. He goes through everything  well. Quizzes were all online as well as midterm/final. If ever have questions he always knows the answer. Not to mention he has written many papers on calculus.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2013<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do everything you can to not take Stats with him!

Its not difficult to get a good grade if you know how to learn from examples. He is easy going and doesn't care at all about attendance, I would recommend him if you're good at math and not stupid. Easy A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So unclear-speaks too fast and has too many thoughts going on in his head. He goes back and forth in what he says. Assignments for this class were hard because he does not clearly explain how to do the problems. He is not that hard of a grader. Lets you get out early</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2012<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This has been a great class. All you need to do is sit in the front of the class, take the notes, and ask questions if you don't understand. The quizzes were easy and the midterm was strait forward. I have yet to take the final. Also Mr. Chin is hilarious. He is a classic geek and weirdly funny.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2012<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly I've never had a worse teacher than his guy. He moves through the material way to fast and never explains. He expects you to understand what he is saying and never answers questions correctly or just makes you feel stupid for asking. I learned better by doing the homework then going to class. If you have him, I wish you the best of luck...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2012<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very unclear and not helpful. if i ask a question he makes me feel like an idiot for not knowing.

Lots of students asking questions about material from algebra, not surprised they didn't do well.  Know the material and do the optional homework - quiz and test problems are just like the in-class questions.

If you know basic algebra, you can do great in his class. He is extremely knowledgable, and his notes and lecture are all-encompassing. I didn't know any calculus prior to the class and with his help I got an A on every test. He also keeps the class fun with his sense of humor. Genius</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/14/2010<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Oh William, he's so lost in his own genius. unfortunatly for he, his expansive brainpower just doesn't translate into effective teaching. Although he had mastered the material, he did not really aid my mastery of anything other than naps. But he is actually quite humourous, and not because he wants to be.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2009<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked Prof Chin.  He takes the time to explain and review any problems you ask.  He passes out handouts with the problems worked out and review sheets for final and midterm.  Quiz every class based on HW.  Midterm and final-lets you use a formula sheet for final.  Go to class, do hw and you'll do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2009<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked professor Chin. your grade is made up of one week quizzes, midterm and final & he curves. I got A's on both with out the curve. Just listen and do the optional homework and you'll be set. He goes over the problems you dont understand in the beginning of class too! go to class & do homework and you'll get an A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took this class thinking it would be a fun class about gambling and gaming. It really wasn't till the latter half of the class. I am sort of bitter since I turned in all my homework asked him if there was anything I missed he said no and then when grades came out he said I was missing three assignments. Went from a A to a B. Alright teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2009<br>Class Name: MATH112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great class on using math to gamble.

Quiz every week based on homework, mid term, and final. Material is not the most interesting but if you just PAY ATTENTION and do the homework the class is an easy A.

I thought he was a jackass too cause he wouldnt regrade my test when I had some correct marked wrong.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2004<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2004<br>Class Name: 142<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>clear helpful but maybe a litlle to rushed</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2004<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He tries to explain things as best he can, but that's not always enough.

Doesn't take attendance, only showed up once a week to take the quizzes, since all quizes/tests are taken straight from the homework.
