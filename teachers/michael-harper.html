By taking Harper you are investing in a great sleep. But honestly, he knows his material and teaches, but is extermely dull. I did well by attending each class, taking good notes, and didn't even own a book. Keep up to date with h/w though he doesn't go over all, it is good practice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2009<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are a finance major and you would like to learn take him. But if you are some marketing major that does not want to work don't take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2009<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is not helpful at all. He has 2 quizes, a midterm and final. He doesn't really tell you what to expect. if you take him, just read the book. he does curve though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2009<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok straight up. 1. 2 quizes 2 tests, all hard. 2. No attendence policy. 3. Buy the book and teach yourself, not hard to do. 4. You can pull off an B/A. 5. Don't expect sn exciting teacher, he's SOOOO boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2009<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BORING ! This guy should stop teaching asap. Fair grader but expect to die of bordom during his dry lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2009<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good prof. He doesn't require attendance but all of his quiz and tests are from class notes and homework problems. Grading: Quiz1 10%, Midterm 40%, Quiz2 10%, Final 40%. He does curve. I say take him!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2009<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the worse teachers I have ever had at DePaul! If you are stuck on something, he will not help you. One final and one midterm, two small quizzes which are all hard. He has told me to go to the 'tutoring center' but no one is there to tutor. I asked if I can email him w questions says Yes, I guess you can try that.  I had to pay a tutor to hel</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok...this is the true rating of this teacher.I took as my last option and did extremely good in his class. His curves are the best.  His voice is low and no energy in teaching.  His test/quiz are hard as hell. His teaching is not that bad. Take him and get a good grade by just reading the chapter and do his problems and you shld be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2008<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a pretty good teacher. Very nice guy overall. His classes can be a bit boring at times but he does what he can to keep them interesting. He knows a lot so he shares very valuable information that isn't in the book. The quizzes and tests are straight forward and he curves. If you go to class to learn and not for entertainment he is great!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I got a B in his class. I came to his lectures I didn't do any of the homework, but I REALLY studied for the midterm and the final. He isn't a bad guy, but I just didn't find the class to be presented in an interesting way.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2007<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very boring and low voice. Needs a bit more energy. Class is easy , but you have a lot to memorize.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2007<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Harper is one of the true great teachers of finance. Not only he teaches you the fundamentals as the course describes he explains the material what the text perceives. Sure the exams and the quizes are a bit tricky but do the problems and read the text because it is based on concepts and you will do great. Total points will be curved.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/27/2007<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>boring, hard to distinguish what he is teaching from the book and what he is simply adding into lectures from his own work experience. Quizzes and tests aren't horrible and DOES give healthy curve when grading but DON'T feel as though I've learned much of anything.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2007<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have no idea why everyone is giving him a bad review. Just go to his class, take notes!  For exams, just study the examples he gives you and study the notes REALLY well.  You will at least get a B.  His test problems are similar to homework.  Also, the test averages are like 50% but he gives a very healty curve!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2006<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The book was more helpful to me. His lectures are boring; the quizzes (2) are helpful though so don't miss them...they give you an idea of the question that will be on the exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2006<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He sucks!!! Not clear at all.  Doesn't explain the material at all and test and quizes are extremly hard.  DONT TAKE HIM!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2006<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is really boring.  I'm not a fiance major, so, i really had no interest.  Nice guy, just very dull and boring.  Hard to schedule time wtih him since he is only part time.  Just d the homework, and you'll get by with atleast a B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2006<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>STAY AWAY!!! I just literally failed his final, its IMPOSSIBLE!!! HE SUX!! He can not teach for crap...he might be very smart and knows his stuff but you know what not everyone go to the class are at the same level. Seriously avoid him! And the book doesnt help you at all...it just ocnfuses you more after his lecture</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2006<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Harper is a nice guy but he CAN NOT TEACH. Avoid him at all costs. His notes are soooo unclear and he expects you to already know everything coming into the class. I had to teach myself everything in this course and chances are, you will too. Grade consists of 2 quizes, midterm, and final. Huge curve in class because everyone does so bad!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2006<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor sucks. He is extremely difficult. You have to learn everything on your own. His explanations don't help in the least.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2006<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He does not do a very good job explaining. His tests are very tricky and he does not curve even when the class average is really low. I am an A student and i got a B in this class even though i studied and put in the effort!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really dont think Harper is hard. Does know subject well, just not well at teaching it. I didnt really put forth the effort I should have in the class, otherwise I would have gotten an A. My buddy did the HW, went to class everyday, and put forth the effort ending in an A. I still received a B by just going to class and taking notes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2006<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i thought he did a good job explaining the subject matter. i was able to do really well on exams just by going off his notes/lectures and not even reading the book. very structured and organized. tests are tricky and each question counts for a percentage point, although i think small curve is involved. if you show up and take notes, you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2006<br>Class Name: 330<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>hard hard hard tests. doesnt say what'll be on, doesn't say what to study, lets you kinda go on your own.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2005<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was extremely boring.  This man may know his stuff but he does not know how to teach.  I found that class time was wasted on unimportant material, and the tests were really hard.  The book was helpful moreso than class.  No attendance necessary.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2005<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Midterm and Final exams are very hard and tricky. Classes are really boring, but he didn't take attendance though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2005<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid this guy if you can. Doesn't know how to teach finance. From all the teachers I have had, he is by far the worst one.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2005<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher might know finance, but he does not know how to teach it. He is very boring, and his exams are hard. I would not take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: 333<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>2 quizzes are ok.....Final and midterm very difficult (a lot of tough questions that weren't covered as well as expected), but he does curve which helps a lot.  Reading the book helped too.  Most of calculations on test were like those from homework, but he through in a few tough ones.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2005<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I felt that this class was ok. He could have been a little clearer when he talked about certain things. Because I took a FIN elective a qtr before this class, it made this class easier. Just come to class and take good notes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/06/2005<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good and easy going class and teacher.  Two easy quizes, two easy tests.  Does not take an attendance.  Definitely take him,</div></div></div></body></html>
