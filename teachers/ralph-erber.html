He is very intelligent and willing to help if you have questions. Some may not identify with his witty humor, but they just need to add some ****e into their music collection and loosen up. Indeed, the text is lengthy, but if you pick out the main points there should be little difficulty.

Lectures are so boring, and he is rude if you email him! I was interested in the class until he ruined it. Not to mention, you use the book he wrote (which is as bad to read as it is to listen to him)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2007<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome class!!

The class is not hard as long as you read the txt n go to class to listen to the lectures. The material may be boring, but its a beginning class with many definitions but he makes the lectures funny and entertaining. There are only 3 tests with 30 questions..not bad if you study. I really liked him n would easily take again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2005<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had him for Explore class, he really doesn't seem to care much about the students, likes to hear himself talk.
