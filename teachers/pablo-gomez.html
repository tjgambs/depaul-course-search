He as extremely understanding and I always look forward to his class. He is very understanding and is always trying to help his students. I love his approach to teaching, his class is one of the few that I don't fall asleep in. I definitely recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2014<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>First of all, we did not meet for class for the first two weeks. He claimed this was so we could have time to work on our "Your Turn To Teach" projects, which require us to do a presentation on a psych topic. No teaching happens here; just discussion. He thinks that we will absorb more this way, and maybe in a 300-level class we would; not Intro.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2013<br>Class Name: PSY340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want an A, and learn absolutely nothing this is the class for you. Showing up to class was useless because you don't actually learn statistics. He just goes on and on about nothing and you do the HW based on the examples in the book. He means so well though. He wants this students to do well but he needs to think on our level. Easy Grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2012<br>Class Name: HON207<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want a class that's an easy A and you learn absolutely nothing this is the class for you. He thinks on an incomprehensible level and the final project is pointless, but will give an A for trying. Super nice guy, I felt sorry for him. Doesn't answer email EVER.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2012<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the worst and hardest class I have ever taken. You literally have to teach yourself everything (what he calls "the pilot approach"). The online homework also takes DAYS to do (not an exaggeration) and gets extremely difficult. I have to take this class again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2012<br>Class Name: HON207<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the best honors teachers you will ever have. Easy class. Homework after every class but very easy, reflective paragraph. 1 take home quiz/test. the final is a project that is complicated but he helps you every step of the way. Super nice guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2009<br>Class Name: HON207<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gomez's version of Cognitive Science is highly science based. If you don't like science, don't take this one. If you do, then this class is awesome. You learn a lot about the brain and other controversial theories about consciousness. He's a very nice guy and wants you to do well. I easily got an A with a limited knowledge of material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2009<br>Class Name: HON207<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cool professor! The material was a little confusing sometimes but his explanations and slides helped a lot. Assignments were discussion questions and midterm and final. Kept it interesting with YouTube videos and other stuff. Take this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2009<br>Class Name: HON207<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't ever let anyone tell you they don't like you accent Pablo!!  I know you read these things and I just want to tell you that I really did enjoy your class even though I has and still have know interest in the subject matter.  You were very nice and very helpful to all of us humanities students who had no clue about anything science-related.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2008<br>Class Name: HON207<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked Pablo because he acknowledges the fact that 80% of the class is only taking it because its required for Honors and the subject is really hard to understand for most people, espeically those who are not into the sciences.  His accent didn't make a difference; its actually kind of cute. He's not at all hard to understand when he speaks.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2008<br>Class Name: HON207<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Gomez is a great teacher, I'd recommend him for hon 207. You learn a lot of interesting things and he really knows what he's talking about. You can understand him very well, I don't know why anyone would say he has a bad accent. Seriously, take him if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2007<br>Class Name: HON207<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Gomez is great.  He's not a very traditional teacher - very little homework, very loose grading - but he genuinely wants to help you understand some very difficult concepts.  I'm a History major with almost no CS knowledge and I learned a LOT.  It's a pretty irritating honors requirement at first, but keep an open mind.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2007<br>Class Name: HON207<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he came late to every single class. his lectures were haphazard at best. very difficult to get in touch w/ for group meetings. easy grader but the class was frustrating and a pointless requirement.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2006<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There was no need really for a professor in this class, it was entirely based on a computer program.  He walks around and offers help, but gets frustrated when you actually need it.  I recommend the class, only because you can work at your own pace.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2006<br>Class Name: HON207<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gme, you are too self-concious!  Relax! You rock!  I know you are readn this and I recommend you to anyone.   eople, take this prof. He is soooo concerned about his students that it amaes me!   He really cares.  He claimshe has a thick accent but uderstoodevery word.  His lectures are aweome too!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2006<br>Class Name: HON207<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Material is tricky, but Gomez is amazing at explaining concepts and makes them easier to understand.  Very funny.  When class felt syllabus was unreasonably difficult, he was very accommodating in changing it to fit our strengths.  Many opportunities to get a good grade.  If you do the assignments you will most likely receive an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/26/2006<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible professor.  Confused about his own syllabus, changed requirements too frequently and got angry at students for trying to get him to clarify things.  It's a good thing I knew a lot of math before this class because he explains things horribly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2006<br>Class Name: STATS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing Teacher!!!!!!!!Truly cares!!!!!!!!!Gomez Rocks!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2005<br>Class Name: DISCOVRCHICAGO<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pablo is the coolest teacher ever!! This was a fun, laid back and relaxing class. We hardly did anything. We had 1 essay and he's an easy grader. Interesting class, I learned a lot but at the same time it was a carefree environment. Take him! He's very intelligent, you'll learn a lot, but won't be stressed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/17/2005<br>Class Name: PSY240360<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love this professor! He was always willing to help.  I had him for stats, and he always encouraged me to reach my potential, and he also made the material easier to learn.  I'll take any class he has to offer!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2005<br>Class Name: STATS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2005<br>Class Name: STATS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very understanding, lets student go at own pace.

The test are crazy easy and your grade is heavily dependent on your portfolio which is composed of super easy questions. (one question per week).  He gives the answers to each question during the lecture.  He is understanding with late work and mistakes.  TAKE HIM...EASY A!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2005<br>Class Name: BBE510<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really good professor. One of the best at DePaul. He is too hard on himself. Makes class interesting with his quirky examples that always seem to make sense.  One of the smartest people I have met.  Hope the BBE program keeps him around we need someone like him to break up the routine of the same two prof. Highly recommend 2 friend a good guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: PSY360<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was such an easy teacher, but at the same time, he was a sweetheart.  He's one of those teachers you know you can take advantage of, but you shouldn't!  His grading was very easy and there was barely any homework or tests!  I learned a lot from him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/14/2005<br>Class Name: PSY2<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was by far the best class that I have taken at Depaul.

Powerpoints and lectures are easy to understand. Powerpoints are put on blackboard and so are study questions for the midterm and final.

He didn't understand what he was teaching (stats) and often had to be corrected by students. Since everyone failed the first of 3 midterms, he started giving out extra-credit for attendance and doing probability experiments in class (like rolling a die 100x)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2005<br>Class Name: PSY360<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst teacher I ever had and couldn't understand a word of what he was saying.
