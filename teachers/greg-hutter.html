He's fun, "hip", and just cool. He's not the easiest grader of the aural professors, but he's not super hard. Make sure your performance exams are well prepared because he does grade those pretty tough. It's a shame that by Aural 5, it's just too boring to care really</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2013<br>Class Name: AURALTRAINING<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was too busy to put some time aside to help those struggling in his class. He did not understand why some people failed the course saying it was "not hard", which could be hurtful to some students. If you aren't naturally gifted, do not take him. Find a teacher that will help you and not make you feel stupid.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2012<br>Class Name: M202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You will only use the Ottman text book for class.

Never went to lecture and barely used the book, if at all.  Just make sure to get the study guides he hands out the day before the exams and look up all the definitions and you should get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2007<br>Class Name: MUS231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hutter is my favorite at DePaul. He's so incredibly sarcastic and HILARIOUS. Aural skills will make you want to get out of bed, just to see what Hutter-isms will be said today. The G-Hutt is the man.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2006<br>Class Name: AURAL<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is cool!
