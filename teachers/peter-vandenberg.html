There are a lot of DETAILED quizzes about pointless book readings. Also a super hard grader of papers. To make it worse, his voice is super monotonous and he doesn't stop talking. WORST GEN_ED CLASS I EVER TOOK!! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2015<br>Class Name: 104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Vandenberg is an alright WRD 104 teacher. He's a super tough grader but he really pushed me with my assignments. He's a little dry in class but don't doze off because he does give crucial information.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>He's a cool guy. He let's you call him Pete. There are many quizzes, so there are many readings to do. Just read and write what you're supposed to and you should be fine. There's work with "Digication," but he offers extra credit. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Cool instructor. He does not require in-class participation. Read the text book and do the assignments and you'll get the grade you want. He can be very boring though. His lectures often drone on to tears.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>being the head of the department, professor knows what he is talking about. class was a little boring because the subject matter is dry, but if you do the assignments and participate its not that bad. requires one-on-one meetings with all students, so class is beneficial. textbook literally not used. awesome professor for my first quarter. TAKE!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This Professor is very straight to the point. It's a writing class that allows a certain creativity. The projects that he assigns are absolutely helpful and easy. To pass the class all you need to do is write the way he says.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2009<br>Class Name: ENG300<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is probably a pretty nice guy, but so so boring.Taking a three hour night class with him was a big mistake.I would sit and stare at the clock waiting for class to be over.He feels the need to keep you the whole time although he has taught what he needed to in 15 minutes.The class was a waste of my time, and I did not enjoy it at all. Don't take.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My favorite teacher this quarter. I'm a little disappointed that I didn't get the grade I wanted though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unlike everyone else, I thought he was pretty awesome. Being my first professor ever in college, he gave a great impression. He is clear in what he wants as long as you pay attention. If you don't understand anything, ask. He is very helpful. A few papers but nothing too stressful. I would definitely take his class again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i posted the last comment and i spoke too soon. he is definitley not what i thought he was. he is VERY unclear and not very helpful in the class. he does not tell vital information for assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i'm not sure why people don't like him... in my class he was very unbiased and mostly entertaining. the class wasn't terrible like everyone says. i will say though... everytime i sent an email and asked him to email me back to let me know something or whether he could open an attachment i was never emailed back. that kinda sucked. overall=take him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/21/2007<br>Class Name: NMS505<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For being the head of the New Media Studies department, Pete seems clueless about most web and multimedia technologies. :(</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2006<br>Class Name: RHETO400<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Asks a lot of questions but doesn't produce many answers.

Maybe it's a good thing, he'll research more and teach less.  He knows his content really well, but as many have said, he is extremely redundant.  What kind of teacher expects you to know what they're thinking&#63;  A good teacher expects you to learn!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2005<br>Class Name: INTROTORD<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's really passionate, but not very organized.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/06/2005<br>Class Name: RHETORICMAW<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't expect answers here, only leading questions. Prof is trying to get people to think. I found his class tough, a lot of work, and sometimes contentious, but enjoyed it and learned a lot. Graded fairly and expected clear, concise writing and thinking and class participation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2005<br>Class Name: RHETORIC<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I cannot remember a class where I have learned less. His is BORING. I literally cried once or twice before class because I didn't want to go. He is boring and he totally plays favorites. Take Heather Graves for any rhetoric classes instead. She is the best!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2005<br>Class Name: ENGRHETOFGRF<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Danger in ghettos&#63;Step away from your mama & get out more.A man of great intellect and good humor, he exudes a definite passion & uses the like to inspire his stdnts social awareness and intellectual growth.Brings something diff to the table and deserves 2 be lauded for it.Cool guy, terrific prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2004<br>Class Name: EXPL<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2004<br>Class Name: ENG208<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is not bad, I just felt that coming out of the class I hadn't learned much.  The main ideas of the class were not well established. However, he is willing to help you, but you end up being more confused after the help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2004<br>Class Name: EXPLORE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Graffiti was cool. Very nice guy. Appreciate effort and participation. Field trips were a little too ghetto for me, but very neat class. I wouldn't say this class was EASY, but an attainable A if you try.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2004<br>Class Name: EXPLORECH<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was boring but i thought that he was ok cuz he was so easy. He made an honest effort to engage the class in the activities and showed interest in the subject - Graffiti. I thought the class was very interesting, more so than he was.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2004<br>Class Name: ENG208<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is, quite possibly, the most boring lecturer on the planet. He speaks for an hour, and manages to say absolutely nothing. In addition, he allows zero leeway on creative expression, and will dock your grade if you don't adhere to his strict guidelines.</div></div></div></body></html>
