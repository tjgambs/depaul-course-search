I was in for a pleasant surprise with him.  He has a beautiful way with words, and explains thoroughly.  It didn't hurt that he was extremely easy on the eyes.  My only complaint was that he had poor attendance and was late with returning assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2004<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this class, and the teacher. He was extremely helpful, very clear, and very nice. He works with you personally to help you on papers. Great guy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2004<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is an interesting breed. Although i will grant him an eloquent control of the language, i feel that he can be pompous at times. Prefers his opinions over yours every time. Not too tough,gives decent readings I thought he looked like the older brother off of boy meets world...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2004<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome guy. WAY diff. than every other eng teacher i'd ever had- taught me new ways to write. Easy grader- but slow. 4 major papers and a few small assignments in between. I was sad to hear that he's done at DPU after this quarter. One of the best teacher's i've had- WHEN he showed up to class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2004<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He really likes the sound of his own voice, maybe he feels that he has to be so authoritative because hes so young and closer in age with some students. Takes forever to pass grades back!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2004<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's really full of himself, but everything is pretty easy.  Be ready to listen to HIM for the entire class.  Also looks like Johnny Depp.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i dont agree that he was easy. he's much to concerned with himself and hearing himself speak. He's more concerned with word choices in papers than he is on the actual content itself. Although he wasn't too hard, he wasn't easy either.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is really Cool. He is young and very laid back. Not a tough grader, my lowest grade was a C and i remember i did not try, in that specific essay. there are 5 papers, and they are all easy to write. He is a perfect example of an english prof</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2004<br>Class Name: WRC108<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He gives students a lot of homework.  If you are prepared to read many articles and such material then go right ahead.  It is possible to get A's but mostly he likes to give B's.  Don't get fooled by his sexy style, he is a tough professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is indeed intellectual...Funny guy..Knows everything...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2004<br>Class Name: ENGLISH<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this man is very intellectual and COOL. he likes public image limited, how cool is that&#63; it doesn't get much cooler...
