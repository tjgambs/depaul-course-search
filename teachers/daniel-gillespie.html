Assignments are clear cut and from the book and they're pretty easy, plus you go over it all the next class.  Mid-term and Final are basically the only two tests but some questions are from the homework assignments.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2013<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very clear about what he wants you to do. You'll definitely need the textbook, as I used it every week. Not afraid to call on random people, but if you prepare yourself for class it will be a breeze. I took it as a night class and we usually got out early.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2012<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a sweetheart. Study the power points for the 2 quizes and you will be fine. Exams are based off the HW so make sure you do it and correct it when he goes over it in class. Exams are written and challenging if you don't do HW or pay attention--but not difficult. He does call on people for hw answers so make sure you are prepared! Good man tho</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2011<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of my favorite professors at DePaul! Do need to do the case study questions but he doesn't grade it. However, he goes over it class so make sure you go. It you know how to do your case study questions you'll do good on the test.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2010<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's a trial court judge at the daley center.  he's an old, friendly, wise man who knows his stuff.  he describes his cases that relate to the course.  be sure to go to class because you go over the case study questions that are identical on the midterm/final.  after the mt/final, i had no clue how i felt what grade i go.  i got a B in the end.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2009<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Gillespie for Business Law my first quarter at DePaul.  He's a wonderful instructor and makes class interesting and involving.  Doing all the homework makes the exams a total breeze because they are almost an exact replica of the homework problems. A++ highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2009<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>one of my favorite classes at DePaul. He brings his real life experience from the court to the classroom, class is basically 2 online quizzes, midterm and final. There is homework assigned every week that does not count towards your grade but in the end it pays off to do them, the midterm and final are verbatum from the cases studied in class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2009<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Judge Glisspi is my favorite. He's helpful and very nice. The cool thing is that he tells us stories from his court. Make sure you do all homework and attend classes because the mid and final are from homework.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2009<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hes a good guy,very helpful, explains things clearly and tries to get everyone to be on the same page. The class consists of 2 tests, mid and final. Basically the test is made up of cases that u went over in class, so do ur hw and bring the power points to class. And there r 2 quizes that are 20% of ur grade  but u can use ur book on them. Take Him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2009<br>Class Name: BLAW201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sooooo Hooottttt!!!!!

Tests are not that easy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2008<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was not what I expected. I thought this would be a breeze. The professor jumped right into all this law verbiage. People like me who are taking this as a requirement are immediately confused. He also calls on people randomly and asks questions. I hated that!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2008<br>Class Name: MGT563<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Negotiation Skills - fantastic class.

Not sure why everyone say's he's easy because it wasn't a cakewalk or anything. Got a B in the class and I put good effort into it, but I felt it was fair. Weekly homework briefs and problems, two online quizzes and midterm/final based on stuff we went over in class. Overall recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2008<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good Prof. He introduced real cases ( he is a judge too) into the lectures to give us a better understanding of the material. Homework didn't seem mandatory, but I missed a few and ended up with a B+ after doing well on both exams. Exams were essay based but he used example cases from the homework on the test.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2006<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>pretty easy, you can print all your notes, Hw for every class but just graded to see if you did it, and you go over it in class, one paper that he grades super easy, study for the midterm and final and you will get an A, really nice and understanding guy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2005<br>Class Name: BLW500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgeable and a great teacher. He made his classes very interesting and interactive. He makes you think and at the same time learn a lot. I am sure he is a great Judge and thare are no words to explain how great this professor is and I wonder why other professors at DePaul do not follow his way of teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2005<br>Class Name: BLW500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>FANTASTIC prof!  He is a part-time prof. and a full-time judge, so he really knows the law and teaches it well.  His conversations were engaging, he was happy to discuss material the students were interested in, and he was very accessible to students.  Class was a lot of work, but very interesting and not too hard.  Gillespie is HIGHLY recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2005<br>Class Name: BLW500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good class and good discussion</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2005<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I just recieved my grade for his class.  Did well for not going to class or putting in a good effort.    His class isn't hard.  For the midterm just study the problems, for the final study the cases. I highly suggest doing the homework. I didn't but it would have helped a lot.  Read the chapters, do the homework and go to class, you will get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2005<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There aren't enough nice things to say. What a fun teacher; he makes you feel at ease in his class. Other teachers should take notes about his teaching style. He makes the very boring subject of Business Law interesting for all. Be prepared to laugh a lot in class. Do the homework & study for the mid & final and you'll be fine. I loved this guy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2005<br>Class Name: BLW<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you're not that interested in law you should definately take this teacher.  He cracks jokes and makes class interesting by telling stories about the cases he tries.  I always leave class feeling completely clear on the course material.  Tests are hard but you receive a study guide that's very specific.  Study and pass with an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2005<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>excellent teacher. he's a judge and often discusses certain theories and how they apply to his daily job. he is really interesting and funny. take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2005<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super easy.  Class can be a bit intimidating he will call on you for homework problems... I got called on every week and got all of them wrong, but I still ended up with a 100 on the midterm and final somehow.  just look over hw and cases before the exams and you'll be fine</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2005<br>Class Name: BLW<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a sweet guy!

His class is very easy, although the material is not. You will have an A if you attend class, pay attention, and review the provided powerpoint slides.
