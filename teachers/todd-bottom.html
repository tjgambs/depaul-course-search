He openly admitted he knew nothing about the topic, was typically confusing and talked on and on about topics that had nothing to do with the class nor the exams. His disorganization was distracting and he was rude to some students in class. He grades too harsh for his lack of instructing. Stay away!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2014<br>Class Name: PSY340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>he is a great person, but not a great professor. He is often unclear and indecisive, and puts far too much weight on the students shoulders to decide things like grades and assignments, rather than determining himself as a prof. He's clearly passionate about the topic, but has no idea what he's doing in the classroom</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2014<br>Class Name: PSY343<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Bottom was awesome. He knew his stuff, he was helpful, and was great to have as an instructor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2014<br>Class Name: PSY354<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I wouldn't say he is the best at teaching but he really does know his stuff. What I Didn't like how he made us write all our papers on a topic we chose in the beginning of the quarter, which started to be boring and difficult to find research on. He is a nice teacher but he hesitates when you go and ask him for help on a paper.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/01/2013<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take someone else who has experience teaching this course, DO NOT RISK YOUR GRADE</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2012<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't trust this guy if he says he will give you the final online. Expect for your grade to drop significantly. I was doing extremely well in his class in the spring semester until he dropped an extremely unfair online final on us that was 100x harder than both the other exams. Avoid this jerk.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2012<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely agree w the last post, I also recommend taking another professor who KNOWS what he/she is doing if u plan on passing statistics. Attendance is not mandatory, but for this class U NEED to be there. 5quizes, 6hw(1drops), and 3exams. One good thing is that he is pretty fast in returning assignments and posting them on D2L.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2012<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was his first time teaching statistics and he made several mistakes on quizes, hw,powerpoints, and exam questions. And some of the time he wouldn't even admit to it!? It was confusing half the time bc he would also get confused looking at his own problem on the board. To top it off he refuses to round off final grades by 1 or 2 pnts!!! :(</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2012<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved his class. super easy, just make sure you read & take notes. everything that's expected is basically spelled out, so its not tough to get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2012<br>Class Name: PSY364<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a wonderful course, and Todd real cares about his students. eassssssy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2011<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>by far my favorite teacher! super helpful both in class and out. super easy if you just get your work done. you dont need the book unless you want it and he lets you out early fairly often</div></div></div></body></html>
