He is the first professor who makes a difficult course easy. You must work though to achieve the grade A, simply you need to spend couple of hours outside the class and practice. No difficulty on midterm and final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best professor I've had at DePaul.
