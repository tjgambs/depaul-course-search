I went to all but 2 or 3 classes and did all the assignments and then at the end of class he told me that class was mandatory when he said it wasn't in the syllabus and gave me a horrible grade he said was justified. I don't remember the section but it was the history of modern Europe.  Save yourself the trouble!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2008<br>Class Name: HIST217<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think his class was great. He explained what he wanted from the papers to us twice. His structure and what he wanted from the papers was very clear. He had us practice on two short papers before doing a larger one. Whoever posted the previous comments must have been sleeping or disorgqainzed him/her self. One of the BEST prof. I have had here.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2008<br>Class Name: HST217<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the most disorganized professor I've ever had in my life.

He has a good sense of humor.  He assigns so much reading material, but you don't actually have to read it...just read for your specific assignment.  Good class discussions...participate!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2007<br>Class Name: HST220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a great teacher.
