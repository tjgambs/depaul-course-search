She is smart but does not try to help her students succeed.  Avoid this at all costs.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2015<br>Class Name: MCS342503<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>The reading  material for one module (one week) can sometimes be up to 60 pages.  No matter how many people proof read your paper for "clarity," your work will never be clear enough for her; shes a nit-picker.  A week's work of lecturing and clip viewings can take up to 3-4 hours per week plus readings.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2014<br>Class Name: MCS<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's helpful and cares about you when you ask for help or clarification, but definitely expects A LOT from you. Everything matters- you cannot skip one assignment or you will fail. Participation is a must. Tends to be a tough grader- must be very, very, very specific- grad level grader. One of the hardest classes i've ever been in.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2014<br>Class Name: MCS273<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Read these reviews but still took her class. I really liked her at first until I started needing help. I did everything she said and still wasn't getting the grades I wanted. Really tough grader with not great feedback. I just checked my grades and got a 65% for online participation... It's an online class. I turned everything in. Why???</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2014<br>Class Name: MCS392<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take her!!!!! She seems really nice, but is super hard.  The content is really interesting, but she doesn't make it fun at all.  She expects way too much and doesn't clarify at all.  She doesn't realize that you might have other classes and can't only spend time on MCS.  If you have a chance don't take her or the class, it's not worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2013<br>Class Name: MCS355<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really enjoy her. Yes, the class is demanding but, you do learn a lot. She always keeps things interesting. My only three complaints about her class are 1) Powerpoints lack a lot of information. 2) The midterm was insanely hard. 3) Clarity. She is a fair professor and is open to questions. I recommend it if you're hard working.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2012<br>Class Name: MCS342<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was excited to take this class and then she ruined it for me. In class she is super nice and fun and then when it comes to hw she becomes completely different. Everyone seems to have clarity issues in writing which she grades super hard. When giving her ny type of constructive criticism she becomes super defensive. Dnt do it. Take someone else.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2012<br>Class Name: MCS271<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a sweetheart. She has a sharp wit, and her stories are both helpful in understanding the course material and entertaining. She's a decently tough grader, but it is completely fair. She is a teacher who legitimately cares, and I really respect her for it. Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2011<br>Class Name: MCS351<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kessler is awesome. She's got a smart sense of humor and is pretty straightforward. Although the class is demanding, she'll go easy if she knows you're actually trying. I ended up dropping the ball on several of my assignments and half-assed quite a bit, but I still got a C (which i totally didn't deserve.) And she's a doctor in tv studies! Damn</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2011<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kelly is a great teacher with an awesome sense of humor.  She grades hard, but fair, and her class is a lot of work.  However, it's not busy work, you're constantly challenged in the best way.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2010<br>Class Name: MCS351<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Exceptionally difficult grader; take-home final was supposed to equate to a normal final, not even close, put in over 20 hrs, only got a B+ on it, grade class like a masters class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/15/2010<br>Class Name: MCS501<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very easy to approach and answers questions well. She grades a little on the hard side but she grades honestly. If you listen to her comments and make suggested changes in future papers you'll see the grades reflected. If you are confused just go ask her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2009<br>Class Name: MCS342<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She really grades her papers and exams hard. She says she teaches you the stuff on the exam but she definetly does not teach it well enough. Crams everything! Makes class boring and tells really really corny jokes that makes me really dislike her alot. DO NOT TAKE HER</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2009<br>Class Name: MCS383<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's fantastic and as long as you pay attention and show respect for her and the subject you'll learn a lot. This is not a blow off class you actually have to want to learn. She values others inputs and makes long classes go by fast!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2009<br>Class Name: MCS271<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE teacher... does not know what she is doing! She tries to cram like 1 month's worth of material into one class period then still puts what we did not thoroughly discuss on the exams. Never take a class with her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2009<br>Class Name: CMN300<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow.... whoever rated her below needs a psychiatric evaluation.  She is difficult and unable to properly articulate and convey her knowledge to the class.  A doctoral degree doesn't make someone a great professor, it is the ability to put it to good use.  Not happening.  Not hard, but not comprehensible.  The book isn't worth buying.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2009<br>Class Name: CMN273<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow.... all I can say is wow to whomever posted before me.  Clearly you are an idiot that doesn't appreciate a good professor when you have one.  Professor Kessler is not only insanely knowledgeable regarding the subjects she teaches, but can keep her classes attention with her quirky wit and fearless attitude toward being herself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2008<br>Class Name: MCS501<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the worst professors I have ever had at DePaul! It was an intro class for my grad program and it was ridiculous! Wasn't clear on assignments, tons of readings, papers due each week it made me want to drop the program all together.</div></div></div></body></html>
