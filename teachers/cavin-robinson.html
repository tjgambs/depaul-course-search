Very vague. he's one of those people that likes to make you think he knows everything. he probably became a teacher to feel smart.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2008<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is not a business ethics class. Do not take it for business ethics, it is a political theory class. Teacher is pretty good swears all the time but its cool he's only 28. Mostly I think that he is teaching his PhD dissertation. He will teach you a lot about what the U.S. is about.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2008<br>Class Name: PHL232<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you like everything sugar coated do not take him. But if you want to actually really want to learn something in all of its truth and honesty then take him. The work is really not that difficult, and he makes understanding PHL really easy. He?s an excellent teacher, who actually cares about his students, and there education. I give him mad props.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2008<br>Class Name: PHL232<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible teacher. Never returned emails. Didn't return  grades until quarter was nearly over. If he didn't know the answer he would make it up (US still on the gold standard&#63; I don't think so!). Claimed to encourage discussion but talked down to students and shot down ideas that differed from his. I did not feel comfortable contributing in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2008<br>Class Name: PHL232<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Robinson is a great professor. I kind of regret taking his class so early in the morning, but overall it was a great class. I took alot away from this class, and he is a very respectable and help to his students. Just as long as you respect his class he'll respect you. He's a great professor and I highly recommend him. Very smart man!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2008<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OH STOP YOUR WINING, (BELOW ME) HE IS A GREATTTTT PROF. WHOEVER IS MAD AT HIM IS ONLY TALKING STUFF BECAUSE HE KEEPS IT REAL AND C'MON CURSE TOO MUCH&#63;&#63;&#63; LIKE NO GROWN PERSONS CURSES, AND THATS WHAT HE DOES TREATS US LIKE REAL ADULTS AND HIS LECTURES ARE FUN AND ASSIGNMENTS ARE VERY STRAIGHT FOWARD AND EASY, HELPS WELL IF U NEED IT! PLEASE TAKE HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2007<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this class!!! He is soo helpful and really smart. He knows what he's talking about and he expects u to participate so that you can fully understand wat he wants and doesn't want. Very concise and helpful. He is encouraging and fun. Good sense of humor , a little sarcastic, and aggressive but it makes u learn and appreciate the subject..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2007<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Know a few things going into his class. 1- attendance is mandatory. 2- he is one of the most intelligent and innovative professors I've had. 3- He doesn't tell; he teaches 4- Any negative comments towards Cavin for &quot;not listening to students ideas&quot; are inaccurate. He basis his class on logical argument-so don't speak without thinking. Great Class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2007<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Read the material and pay attention to his lectures; I took a M-W day class, so it was much more interesting than a night class. He has his biases but DOES NOT shoot you down for having differences. He questions a lot of your morals and ethics; after all, this is business ethics people!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2006<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst PHL teacher at DePaul! First, I got a good grade in his class so don't think im bashing cause of my grade. Second he thinks his ideas are the only right ones, does not know how to present material, does not respect others students' ideas. He should start teaching high school students first and get experience. Don't take this guy he stinks!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2006<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a pretty cool professor, who explains everything and he doesn't try to trick you.  There's no book for this class, but you have to print out readings. I would take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2006<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's an AWESOME professor. He will explain eveyrhting so thoroughly that it is hard to mess up on the papers. The readings are not extensive, but complex. He can spark a very good discussion although he has set points of view he will let others put theirs out there too and will not talk down to you. I would absolutely recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do I like him as a person&#63; Um....no. He thinks he knows everything & no one can change his mind on that. Very annoying weekly hw & reading. Test wasn't too hard. He made the class believe everyone would fail. He's not hot at all; has a balding spot & is the only thing interesting in class to focus on. Super boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2006<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Well, he's umm...different. I didn't like his teaching style, especially his examples and exercises of how we should be 'open-minded.' Also unclear with the final which was one big paper. I don't recommend him, but again it might just have been my dislike for the overall class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/12/2006<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>professor robinson was really into the topic and as long as you asked questions if you didn't understand, you should be able to get a good grade in the class.  he offered to help with the final paper so i don't know why people complain.  easy tests.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2006<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His class was very easy until the final came where you had to write a 4-5 page paper regarding all the confusing material... I had a A+ on the mid-term and around a C on the final... Very nice guy overall, although unclear at times and he sorta rushed through everything near the end... We spend around 8 weeks on one book and 2 weeks on the other 2.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2006<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Come on now...no sense of humor...& my comment wasn't above yours it was UNDER!! Get it right!  Some people just think they're too good & are stuck up when they shouldn't be...poo poo heads!  Whatever Cavin was a great professor...if you think the people who were so annoying were annoying why didn't you say anything&#63; Obviously you were scared.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2006<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's Philosophy so I don't really know if it's hard, the subject itself was hard, but from what I hear he was the hardest philosophy teacher at DePaul</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2006<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great teacher,really helpful and class is very easy as long as u pay attention, ask questions and take good notes.just cuz he's funny doesnt mean u gotta laugh at evrythng, the person above me was probably one of the MOST ANNOYING PEOPLE IN THE CLASS WHO WOULD LAUGH AT EVERYTHING THE GUY SAID.seriously shut the hell up. neways gr8 teacher & class!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2006<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His class is very fun, he'll re-explain the material whenever you do not understand and is willing to help you whenever you need it.  He tried making class fun, but some stupid people in the class thought they were too good to laugh, like the second person who wrote under me.  What losers! Take him you wont regret it...you just have to read alot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2006<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A decent teacher, likes sports, huge steelers fan. I though he was the janitor when he first walked in... He is a a cool guy. dresses very casual, might be a prodigy&#63;&#63;&#63; he is 24 years old and is one class away from his PhD. People usually dont get their PhD until their 26 atleast</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2006<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Claims to be sooo dedicated, but really doesn't care at all. Really unprofessional,cusses throughout class. It makes me very very uncomfortable.  He doesn't stay on topic and thinks he's funny. He's not funny. Relatively lienient grader, but I guess you have to be when you talk and talk but still cover nothing in class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He really knows what he is talking about and is more than willing to help you out but if you are taking it for a liberal arts requirement, do not take T/TH class.  Class (I thought) was boring but then again the subject matter didn't interest me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>cavin is an alright professor...however, i felt as though he talked down to students who were not already knowledgable about the subject. he seemed like he wanted to help, but at the same time,i felt intimidated to ask for help, which is not usually how i am.just reading for hw, some quizes,midterm test &final paper, definitely read...boring class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cavin is a wonderful professor.  He's very understanding and always attempts to help students.  He's very knowledgeable what he teaches and challenges students to think.  Minimal homework, but you learn so much from this guy.  CAVIN ALL THE WAY</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2005<br>Class Name: PHL102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cavin is not as cute as many people seem to think and his phl class is extremely boring! I wanted to fall asleep the minute I got into class.  I suggest you choose a different teacher.  However, he doesn't give that much homework which is probably the best part about his teaching.  So keep searching!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2005<br>Class Name: PHI100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>EXTREMELY WONDERFUL PROFESSOR! I WAS IMPRESSED WITH HOW MUCH HE KNEW HIS CRAFT AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE. YOU WOULD STAY AWAKE BECAUSE YOU WOULD WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN CLASS. IN ALL,IT IS A VERY INTERESTING CLASS.
