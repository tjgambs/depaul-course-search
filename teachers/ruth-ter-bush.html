Lots of busy work with convoluted instructions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2014<br>Class Name: ECT424<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>DR T is a great teacher.  Assignments will take some focus and work but were great learning tools. Highly recommend this class. Staying on top of assignments and participating in discussions are key.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2014<br>Class Name: TDC363<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I think Professor T is very nice and passionate. I enjoy her lectures, but there have been discrepancies between her information and the Cisco Net Academy. Either way, I enjoy her lecture and the class activities. They reinforce the chapter's material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2013<br>Class Name: ECT424<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor has a lot of content to cover in a short 10 week period.  This class is tough, and I would suggest taking it alone, or with an "easy A" class, due to the amount of time that will be spent writing memos/papers/blog comments, and blog-buidling work. It's not hard to get an A, just follow all directions,pay attention & do all the work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2013<br>Class Name: ECT424<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ruth is a great teacher.  Her course was very interesting but be prepared to work hard.  She has several degrees and certificates and pretty much expects you to work for your grade.  Consider taking her course during a full session and not a summer session if you cannot devote a lot of time.  I would have gotan an A opposed to a B if a regular term</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2013<br>Class Name: ECT424<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ruth is tough but if you follow all her instructions, you will get an A. There are 7 memos to write, 2 of which she drops. It's a lot of work, but if you pay attention in class, you should have no problems.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2013<br>Class Name: TDC363<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought she was a great teacher. I can see why people can have a rough time in her course but its due to the course work itself. I strongly suggest not coming into her class not knowing anything. Otherwise she is always willing to help and explain anything you do not understand!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2013<br>Class Name: ECT424<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She comes confusing at first, but then she becomes more organized. She gives out a lot of work (some unnecessary I think). Her assignment comments are inconsiderate. She should expect that students have no idea what she'll be teaching since it's a basic course, but she doesn't seem to know hat.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2013<br>Class Name: ECT424<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yes, some of this material is very dry and boring, however she does a lot to make things fun and interesting.  There is a lot of research, but the assignments are not overly difficult. Take home final. I would take her class again, she is a good lecturer.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2013<br>Class Name: ECT424<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of work, it's her way or the highway, very hard to deal with but she seems nice in class and she will answer all your questions,she's been dictating this class so i had to take it with her, she prepare over 90 slides a day then she can't finish them so she starts to skip through them and go fast the last half hour of the class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2012<br>Class Name: ECT424<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She definitely is a knowledgeable professor. However, the nature of the course itself is very technical and boring. She fails to make it interesting. She would keep talking and for 3 hours straight, who can bear that? Her assignments are tough and intense: 3-4 weekly assignments. I wouldn't take this class if it wasn't a required course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2012<br>Class Name: TDC363<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class online. DePaul accidentally offered this class online, but honored it anyway, so my experience may differ from yours. I found Prof. Ter Bush helpful whenever I had questions, and I had a lot of them. You had to watch pre-recorded lectures. The labs were tough, ask lab techs for help. Final project and test was fair. Good class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2011<br>Class Name: TDC363<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She may be a doctorate, but she doesn't know how to teach. Labs were painful, cause the documents were poorly written/had errors too and she never guided us properly. we were on our own, however she was kind of linient in grading. Its an awesome course but didn't get to learn much from her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2010<br>Class Name: TDC365<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WORST PROFESSOR AT DEPAUL!!! She takes pride in giving hard exams.  And if you do not know the answer to a question that she asks, she basically says oh well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2009<br>Class Name: TDC365<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice lady. She's not too stellar of a teacher and she's not the worst, and she knows it. You get the feeling that she reads a few chapters ahead, and then attempt to teach the class with it...She grades relatively easy, gives extra credit, and allow us to make up lost points on the midterm. She even tells us exactly what to expect on the final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2009<br>Class Name: PM440<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is an online collaboration class with a semester long group project.  The groups were online and classroom students from 2 classes (one taught by another prof).  The assignments were determined last minute and unclear.  She's an interesting lecturer.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2009<br>Class Name: TDC363<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very vague in assignments. Gives many labs but doesn't give instructions on how to do them, either you must know or try to wing it. Tries to teach IP addressing but gets confused herself, making it even harder for people to learn. She is a nice lady, but avoid her as a professor. She knows quite a bit, but can't teach it, she wasnt cut out to teach</div></div></div></body></html>
