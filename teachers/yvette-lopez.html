We got 2 tests Mutliple choices, a group presentation, an analysis cases and an optional final (that can help you save your grade) ! So take Pr Lopez, you'll not be deceived, you'll learn a lot !!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2015<br>Class Name: MGT360<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>There is a mideterm, final, class participation, and two assignments; one individual and one group due at the end of the quarter which are not hard at all.  Class did not do so well on either mideterm or final so she curved it.  She is a great professor and makes the lecture interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2015<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved Professor Lopez and really enjoyed the class. Lectures are a necessity but they're informative and fun because she has a great sense of humor. Tests are difficult but the final can replace the lowest test grade. Overall exams are only 50% of the overall grade so make sure you put forth the effort into the group project and assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2014<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take Her if you wanna learn! Dr.Lopez is one of the best professor at DePaul. No power point, old skool teaching. Learned a lot in class. Defiantly not an easy A but if you try you will get it. 2 exams 50mcq & final 100mcq all in class. Group project so makesure to attend first day &chose  group member wisely. Read book & take notes pay attention!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2014<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Lopez has to be one of my favorite professors of all time. She is genuinely friendly, outgoing, approachable, helpful, clear and easy to talk to. The class is a lot of work and far from easy, but as long as you put in the time you should be fine. If you do well on both the first and second tests, you do not need to take the final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2014<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's pretty cool. Shouldn't be too hard to get at least a B for most people. The group project is just like any other -- it depends on your group. I'm the type to just do everything and e-mail it to everyone else. Final is optional and I found it be really easy (bumped my grade up quite a bit).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2014<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! all kinds of homework(leading discussion, team work, case analysis ,etc) but all very useful for understanding OB. ease atmosphere. Cases discussed during classes really helped you to understand OB from a broader view. Highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2013<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. She is very clear and concise in class. Two tests, an optional final, group project, and a few other small assignments. Two tests are not too difficult if you read the book and go to class. Overall good teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2013<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor! As long as you pay decent attention in class and write down what she puts on the board, you'll do fine AND learn a lot! This is a management class, so be prepared to put on your business hat and work. Three exams including the final (follows notes), group project, and a few individual projects that are not difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2013<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Test are stupid and do not represent notes properly</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2012<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors DePaul has to offer. Crystal clear on what she wants and expects. Actually teaches versus just reading off a power point. Gives you many opportunities to get the grade you want. Easy A for those who are used to working for their grades. Not a class for slackers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2012<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teaches very straightforward and provides you with a study guide on exactly what to learn. 1 group project, 1 essay midterm, & 1 essay final. Be able to memorize a little, but mostly apply the concepts. She is very easy to get in touch with and willing to help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2012<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prob the best prof I've had at DePaul. She is crystal clear with her lectures. She is always willing to help you and answer questions. If you want to ensure you will do well on her tests visit her during office hours to study. Final is optional. Older edition book works great for less $.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2010<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor!  I bought an old edition of the book used in her class (thank god), I only used the book once.  Her lecture notes are all you will need, and she is clear and uses really life examples.  I avg an 87 on the exams but finished with an A- because of the project, case analysis, and current event assignment.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2010<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>prof lopez is extremely helpful. dont miss class because she covers things from outside the book and you will not get her notes unless youre there to listen. final is optional. group project was a WASTE of time. GO TO CLASS and you will ace it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2010<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very strong class. Prof. L is very approachable and knows her stuff. She did a lot to stimulate conversation and try to relate the theories of organizational behavior to the workplace. A big gripe I had was that her notes are totally unorganized. She's a young professor though. If she fixes that, she would be unstoppable!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2010<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am a senoir this year, and this is the BEST class you will ever take. The material is extremely useful! She give in class projects that drill in the topics she is teaching. The most effective, and enjoyable instructor I have EVER had! You will learn and USE this material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2009<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm still taking her course but she is FANTASTIC. She is energetic and really helps get class discussion going. She is very friendly and and helpful. Especially as a new MBA student (I am fulltime), her class is helpful in getting to know your cohort. I would love to take her for more courses.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2009<br>Class Name: MGMT500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yvette follows the book, more or less. Our class was discussion-oriented. She has a kind demeanor. Grading is fair. Written Midterm & final. If you know your stuff (i.e. read the book and paid some attention) you'll be fine. The final was difficult. I got a B+, which was above average, and still got an actual A (I think).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2008<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is soooo amazing! Not only as a teacher but also as a person! Very smart, very friendly and always there if you need her! She states clearly what she wants from you and does her best to teach you that; everything else is up to you! Very inspiring and definetely would take another class with her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2008<br>Class Name: MGMT500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice lady. For easy class, lots of work. There are easier MGMT 500 classes to take than hers. Her notes are all over the place. Exams are essay and she does not really prepare you for what will be asked. Group pres and group assignment too. However, if you study ALL your notes, you should do fine. Most of the class received A's or B's.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2008<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher! Ms Lopez is very nice and helpful. There are 2 assgmts., 2 exams and a final, which is optional because it's designed to improve your grade. There's also a presentation, which is a little bit tough because you have 8 people in your group. Other than that..great class! I definitely recommend it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2008<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are a new MBA student, she is fantastic to have!  She will ease you into the program.  She will be getting her PhD soon, so it's Dr.Lopez for you.  Fantastic asset to DePaul!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2008<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Lopez was great!! She is soo helpful and easy to talk to..its a shame she isnt teaching mgt 301, otherwise i would totally be taking her. she is truly of the nicest professors at depaul. you have 2 tests, group project and she made final optional..what can i say shes great!!! take her you wouldnt regret it.</div></div></div></body></html>
