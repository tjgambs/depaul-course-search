It was a night class that went by quickly. Yes, she lectures straight from her notes, but the discussions are quite interesting if you contribute. She throughly explains what is to be expected on midterm and final. There is reading but if you read, you will easily get a good grade. A GREAT PROF!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>She is really sweet and definitely has experience and knowledge of the field, but she is so boring. She didn't even use slides. She literally just stood and lectured off of her notes. She was extremely slow and never really incorporated anything interesting into the subject except with minor attempts to start discussion.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2010<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Focal Point: Prisons and Education.
