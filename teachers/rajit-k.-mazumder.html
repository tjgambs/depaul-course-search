He is very clear about what he expects you to know and is fair on tests. Gives tons of helpful comments for your paper. He's funny too. Doesn't take BS, so don't sleep in class or text - he'll pick on you. Pay him attention and respect and he will treat you the same.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2013<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I came into this class (Birth of Civilization: Early India) with zero interest, and now I want to go to India more than anything! He is very engaging and his lectures are interesting, especially when he gets off topic. Average grader, wants papers to mimic what sources say. He seems tough but is actually really funny.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2013<br>Class Name: HST153<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher! 2 exams and a paper you choose topic. Took class as a freshman, got an A. Attendance isn't mandatory, but show up if you want a good grade. I didn't read just took notes in class and once you get past all the strange South Asian names, it's fine! He seemed to like people more if they raised their hands and asked questions. Take it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2011<br>Class Name: HIST153<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An easy class, not because the teacher is an easy grader or puts out easy tests, but because he's very enthusiastic and easy to pay attention to. Great teacher, I am looking forward to getting taught by him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2010<br>Class Name: HST153<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The info was pretty interesting.The class on the other hand is boring to be honest. Its a boring lecture. But you have to show up bc the info in class is exactly whats on the final. Don't buy the textbooks. I never used them and got an A. Just study off ur notes. Also print off the study guide and take notes according to it. Class is an easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/27/2010<br>Class Name: HST153<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful professor. Has a true passion for the subject of South Asian history, and does a great job conveying his enthusiasm in the classroom. A good piece of advice would be to make sure that you come to class and take thorough notes. He does not rely all that much on the reading, altho you should do them to get a firmer grasp of the concepts.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2010<br>Class Name: HST153<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do the study guide and come to class and you should do find. Some advice, sit in the front of the class and prepare to write A LOT of notes in this class. Lots of reading but you really don't have to read, if you come to class. Average class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2010<br>Class Name: HIST153<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OK here's the deal.. I earned a B in the class and it wasnt that hard at all, he's a nice guy... the trick to do well is to print out the study guide (which he provides on the first day of class) and when you're taking notes just take notes on what is underlined on the study guide, that will be exactly whats on the test. Basically, GO TO CLASS!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2010<br>Class Name: HST153<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't understand how this guy got good ratings he was hands down the worst teacher I have ever had in my whole college career the class was ridiculous it's all notes that he speeds through plus he has the hardest accent to understand I didn't learn one thing from the guy and worked my tail off and still came out with a F do not take!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2010<br>Class Name: HST151<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor was awesome!!! I can't believe the comments below complaining about the work - You only have a midterm, a final and a paper. Its all really simple. He gives reviews prior to the exams which pretty much detail everything that's going to be on there! He's pretty funny too!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2010<br>Class Name: HIST151<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's so cute! I loved this class...interesting material...study hard nd you will do well!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2010<br>Class Name: HST151<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A professor whom says Attendance not Mandatory..but still takes attendance and annoys students about not coming to class...WTF. He is nice guy to be honest. HORRIBLE teacher. Use some Powerpoints, cause we know your writing your own ratings.  on here ! Only 10% get A or A-... everyone else is usually a C or D. very very very Hard. AVOID !!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2010<br>Class Name: HST151<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very hard class... avoid at all costs. Many many many of the students got C- and Ds! Felt as it was a 400 level course..... way too much material... FML</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2010<br>Class Name: HST151<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You MUST read before coming to class...otherwise he goes through the notes through a Word Document very quickly. It is very very hard too write everything down. Term Paper = 30% of grade/Draft 10% + Midterm 30% + Final 30%.. HARD CLASS...to get an A I spent around 20-25 hours studying for Midterm/and 20-25hrs for Final.... paper took just as long.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2010<br>Class Name: HST151<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was so much fun. He is one of those very few instructors who can actually make the material really interesting. People in the class were genuinely interested in what they were studying. The best part was that attendance was not mandatory...easy A!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2010<br>Class Name: HST151<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Mazumder was an awesome teacher!He made the material super interesting and his objectives were very clear.Attendance is not mandatory. As long as you do the reading and prepare well for his 2 quizzes, you can get an A. He has a great sense of humor too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2010<br>Class Name: HST151<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful professor. Cares about his students greatly and very helpful. Make sure you take notes, they help you study for the exams. Very knowledgable. He's a little funny too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2009<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Mazumder has a genuine interest in his students, which only becomes apparent as you get to know him. He is very knowledgable in the field and makes class feel relevant and interesting. The class is almost all lecture- but I felt constantly engaged. He's pretty funny as well!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2009<br>Class Name: HST152<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doesn't really grade fairly, STRONG indian accent and talks so fast it's kind of obnoxious.  Really no point to this class- made the material so much more boring that it should have been. I like history; he made me hate it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2009<br>Class Name: HST152<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Goes through notes EXTREMELY fast. No attendence policy but if you dont come and take notes midterm and final will be VERY hard.  Kinda boring, he's really interested in India and that's about it....i wouldn't reccomend this class as it requires alot of notetaking, reading, and there are only 3 grades in the class: midterm, term paper, and final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2009<br>Class Name: REL242<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice professor. Explains the material well. Have to write a small paper on a topic of your choice. A mid-term and final for which he gives a study guide and its not that hard. Multiple choice and short answers. Makes a lot of effort on lecturing that why i guess some ppl dont like him since alot is covered. I liked his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2008<br>Class Name: HST248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>awesome teach and great guy. he is very knowledgeable and can answer any questions. entire class is note taking and he goes through pretty fast. you must take notes to pass the exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2008<br>Class Name: HIST151<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>do not take him!!!! he is a tough grader!! never good enough!! do yourself a favor and avoid him at all costs!! nice guy, bad teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2008<br>Class Name: HIST200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is a relly nice guy and will for sure help if you have questions, BUT goes through notes SUPER FAST and he talks really fast. the class was not interesting at all unless your a history major. only take if you can take notes fast, midterm and final are based of the notes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2008<br>Class Name: HIS352<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very good professor and if you do the work you will be rewarded</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2008<br>Class Name: HIST256<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a decent professor. Not all that interesting to be quite honest. BRING A LAPTOP to class. if your a fast typer than you'll definitely benefit. He quickly goes through notes. The notes from class is all you need to do well. Base your papers of the notes and study your finals of the notes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2007<br>Class Name: HIST257<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very intersting but you take a lot of notes. he does not make attendance mandatory but it does help a lot to be in class and to have him know your name.i would take him again in the future</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2007<br>Class Name: HST257<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Well...the midterm & final are not that hard, as long as you read..attendence is not mandatory and he posts final or midterm study guides so u know wat to study for...his lectures are hard to understand but hes a funny and nice guy.at the first few times in class u mite think the class will be very hard, but it turned out not to be. hope that helps</div></div></div></body></html>
