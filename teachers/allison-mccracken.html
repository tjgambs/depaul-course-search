She's sort of a tough grader and and participation is crucial with her, but wow is she an amazing professor. She is incredibly knowledgeable, and she's helped strengthen my academic writing. My mind is always broadened after a quarter with her. She's so great. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2014<br>Class Name: AMS276<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>this class was by far one of the hardest, yet most rewarding classes I've taken at depaul. prof. mccracken honestly broadened so many of my perspectives on gendersexother aspects of american culture. she is so intelegent (though at times intimidating), and she really knows how to stimulate thought provoking discussions. just take her </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2014<br>Class Name: AMS215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. McCracken holds her students to a high standard and gives lots of reading, but she really teaches you methods and improves critical thinking. She is easy to talk to and is very passionate about her subject.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2014<br>Class Name: AMS276<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Makes everyone speak in class or else you get a bad participation grade. That wouldnt be such a bad thing if she didnt act like a know-it-all & judge any less than scholarly comment. She grades hard too. She expects we all write papers exactly how she would do it yet she doesnt explain the criteria that she ends up taking the most points off for.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome Professor, loved her class. Her biggest thing is that you participate and talk in class, but she understands if you're shy. Try to make thoughtful and relevant comments/questions and she'll like you. Kind of seemed to judge kids who said stupid stuff, but so did the rest of the class. I definitely would reccomend her to anyone!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2012<br>Class Name: AMS276<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely the most interesting class I've ever taken. She's a somewhat hard grader and there's a lot of reading, but it's so interesting and typically not talked about that it's worth it. Changed my way of thinking. Just take the class. You won't regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2009<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very smart and knows a lot.  Class is very conversational, and sometimes I wish she would just give more lecture because it feels subjective. She also sometimes comes off as condescending and seems to judge students.  I learned some but it was because I read, not because of her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is so open and honest.  She was not afraid to discuss any topic.  Very passionate and a quiet but great sense of humor. So much fun.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is just reading and papers. The reading is not too long and it comes from a novel so it's easy to pay attention. She grades fairly and it helps if you participate a lot in class since it is a seminar. The material is really interesting and not just typical boring WWII info. I recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2008<br>Class Name: AMSSECT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>McCracken is extremely well versed in American culture and brings a great deal of information to the table that other professors would not. She isn't easy, but she isn't terribly hard either. If you make the effort, she will see that. If you are not someone who talks in class, she lets you do extra writing to make up for it. I HIGHLY recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was excited to take her class; but then she turned out to be a horrible prof. She plays favorites, assignments are very vague & she will penalize you heavily for missing inane details, & I even went for help but it was useless. Though I may be one of a few, I recommend not taking a chance on her and take some of the other great profs. DePaul has!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take her class if you plan on slacking.  She would be mad when most didn't do the readings.  Some of her papers are a bit vague but she is willing to help you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2007<br>Class Name: AMS380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>awsome teacher. her class was one of the funnest and most interesting class i have taken at depaul. even if you are not a comm. major you should still take this class. my assignments included watching THE WIRE and writing a paper on it. it doesnt get any better than that. oh yeah, she really knows her stuff and connects with you very well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very clear.  Fit a lot of material into ten weeks.  Answered all questions thoroughly, available to continue discussion during office hours, and gave further resources.  Also seems to understand the way students learn.  Very young and still connected to our lives.  Makes information pop and therefore teaches it well.

She obviously is very interested and devoted to what she teaches. All opinions and points of view are heard in her class without judgement passed, unless of course, you consider class discussion a judgement. One of the few classes I've been motivated to give my all to.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2006<br>Class Name: SOPHSEMINAR<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her class is fairly easy.

You know you've got a bad teacher when she doesn't listen to you, she only wants to hear what she thinks is right on her papers, and its especially hard when her assignment sheets are bad in explaining what you have to do in the first place. If you DO NOT like thinking and working outside the box, then take her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2006<br>Class Name: AMS150<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a good teacher. She's interested in the subject, and usually doesn't have difficulty gettig the class interested.. usually.  On the hole, she's a pretty good teacher.  She's also one of the hotter professors you've ever seen.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2006<br>Class Name: FOCALPOINT<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love this woman!

McCracken is not one of them. She is simply the worst teacher I have run into. Unfair grading, not helpful even when I did go for help, and very unclear in her assignments (does not let you think outside the box). Any other teacher is better than her so I suggest to stay away at all costs.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2005<br>Class Name: AMS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have taken this teacher for two classes. SHe makes you work, but she chooses interesting articles so you actually want to participate.  She is very clear on what she wants out of the assignments, and she is a fair grader.  She also really works with you to improve your writing skills. I love her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2005<br>Class Name: AMS380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor McCracken is an extremely enlightened woman. She really knows her stuff and is very interesting to have for class. She makes you work, but her classes are very well structured. She is awesome. I have had her for three classes so far, and I learned so much in all of them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2005<br>Class Name: AMS<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher was just not good. In fact she was horrible, I strongly suggest not to take her class unless you like to deal with a hassle for 10 weeks. I'm not sure why many people like her but I am not one of them. Learn from my mistake and don't take her classes, just horrible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This woman is amazing!

Don't always have to read but I recommend it. She's extremely knowledgable, intelligent and interested in your grasp of material and point of view.

I am being lenient on what I am rating her. I do not recommend her class whatever it may be to anyone not because she was so bad but more that there are better teachers out there.

I would take every class I can with her. She is extremely intelligent, and sacrastic and puts pop culture into a whole new perspective. Do the reading and actually think about it and you'll be fine.

I will recommend her highly!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2004<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good, fun teacher.
