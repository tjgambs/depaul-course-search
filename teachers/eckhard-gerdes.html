I thoroughly enjoyed his classes and learned so much useful information. I loved that he put up the most basic rules of grammar on the board on the first day, and he told us, &quot;If you study and live by these rules, you will do fine in my class.&quot; ...I did not like that his book was a required reading...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't think the class was too easy, and I, for one, learned quite a bit.  I learned, for example, that the preferred form of possessive singular nouns ending in &quot;s&quot; adds &quot;'s&quot; rather than just an apostrophe.  &quot;The boss's car&quot; is preferred over &quot;the boss' car.&quot;  Any class is easy if you don't make an effort to learn.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He knows the subject matter very well, and is good with the actual teaching. Unfortunately, he's very strict when it comes to work. Very finicky.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2008<br>Class Name: RHT103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I find it interesting that the students who seem to complain about Mr. Gerdes's teaching all have grammatical flaws in their responses.  Obviously those weren't the good students.  Those of us who were serious really liked the class.  The class discussion was spirited, and this may have been the most interesting English class I ever had.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/15/2008<br>Class Name: ENG101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had his class fall quarter 2007. Gerdes was a great man and an excellent teacher. He always had the most wonderful stories and interesting shirts. He was a fair grader and he appreciated humorous insight and creative writing styles. How dare any of you call his class useless! Eckhard Gerdes is a saint!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2008<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was the best English class I ever had.  He went through our essays in great detail and was always completely clear about what was expected of us.  I learned a ton.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2008<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was a very fun class.  He used lots of examples to explain things and was very helpful when I had questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2008<br>Class Name: ENGL103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've always done well in English and have a strong background in it, but this class taught me more than any other English class I've ever had.  It was excellent!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2008<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I did not learn anything from him! Each class period was based on him rambling about random things including his personal life. He grades each paper in detail and marks every error. Other than the essays, it is basically a blow off class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher I have ever had. Class consists of random ramblings on off-topic subjects.  We were even told &quot;college is not the place to get A's&quot;. He also loves to talk about himself, although the class does not care what his grades were in high school. I would avoid him by all means necessary.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a really nice guy but is an EXTREMLEY hard grader!I always got A's and B's on my english papers in high school but not here.If you're not good at grammar I'd get out now because he will catch the slightest mistaes. He's a smart man...but  just didn't really enjoy the class.</div></div></div></body></html>
