The information she presents is great-- varied material and it directly applies to teaching.  Will use almost everything I learned from her in my day-to-day teaching.  Fantastic teacher!  Wish she taught more classes!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2008<br>Class Name: TL424<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved this class!  Received practical information about teaching from someone who's actually in the classroom!  Missy is nice, down-to-earth, and very helpful (gives qualified advice).  Sometimes the discussions seemed to get a little off topic and were somewhat unstructured, but great class overall.  Would definitely take another class with her!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2008<br>Class Name: TL425<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Missy is a fantastic teacher who provided us with super insight into the real world of teaching.

She is a very fair grader and her assignments actually pertain to what is going on in the world of education.  Very helpful with placing you with a cooperating teacher to get observation hours done.
