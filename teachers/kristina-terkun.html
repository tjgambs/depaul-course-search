Goes the extra mile to provide excellent and original course materials for you to utilize. Does not simply assign book reading and questions. Show your work on all assignments and tests if you want full credit. Likes soccer, racing motorcycles, and wrote a research paper about star wars. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2013<br>Class Name: ECO320<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's alright. Attendance is not mandatory but you might miss the popped quizzes. She's clear on what she wants. 6 popped quizzes, (easy?) daily homework and she drops the lowest ones. You gotta read 2 books and answer questions about them. 1 formal group presentation, final paper or exam depending on how she feels.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2013<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dear god is she boring. I did well mainly due to taking Ap Macro in highschool. For someone who never took an Econ class this may be hard. She does not explain things clearly but only has two tests. The monotone voice and lack of enthusiasm sends most to sleep.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2012<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is really boring. if you look around theres many student with their heads down sleeping.  The hw is useless busy work that doesnt help with her tests at all. I would suggest getting a different teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2012<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Homework assignments everyday from the book. Fairly easy but you can't make them up if missed. Very knowledgeable. References alcohol in all of her examples to make them more interesting. Tests are fairly hard but if you get all 3 in the 90s range, you don't have to take the final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2012<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is really easy. If you do the weekly assignments, study for the basic multiple choice tests, and show up to class, you will get an A. Class is pretty boring though, and she just sits and talks the whole time. Her powerpoints are helpful, but reading and doing homework from the book is most helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2012<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I wasn't sure how econ would be, but she makes the class interesting. It's super straigh forward: show up to lecture, turn in your weekly homework, and study for the exams. You really do have to work in her class to succeed, but it's worth it, you learn a lot</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2012<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's absolutely lovely. Really nice, really passionate about a subject I thought (going into the course) would be really drab. Although you need the textbook for the homework, I learned a lot more from her lectures. Get an A in homework, all three tests and attendance, and you get to miss the final!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2012<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's not a helpful teacher. If you are one of those that doesn't get it the first time, then you will struggle in this class. She does know her stuff but if you have never learned about economics then this class will be hard. She's really boring too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2011<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tests SUCK! You'll need your textbook for homework. She is good at explaining things, but don't doze off, because you might miss something important. She knows her stuff, and explains things thoroughly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2011<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's top notch professor. Would definitely recommend her for anyone taking the introductory Econ classes.  Probably one of the best at DePaul.  She's straightforward and lays out her expectations at the beginning of the quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2011<br>Class Name: ECON305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Proceed with confidence. Excellent instruction, highly organized for each class and seems to really enjoy teaching. Homework is graded, midterm and finals contained no surprises. Supplies a lot of classroom notes and material with PPT slides. Textbook supports lectures and lectures follow textbook organization.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2011<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof is very nice and knowledgeable. Very helpful. Easy homework every class. 3 exams plus final. I think she makes the tests harder than the rest of the class but very doable. I recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2011<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a nice lady. She tells you what to expect. Get A's on three tests and you don't have to take the final. There are daily HW assignments and you make sure to type them! No credit if you dont. Overall class was pretty challenging and make sure not to dose off on class because you might miss something important. Everything builds on eachother.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2011<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes a nice lady but very strict. Attendance is mandatory. While you do cover the material that will be on the test in class, it isn't always sufficient or in depth to understand it fully. If another professor is available consider the other otherwise this isn't a horrible horrible choice. FYI dont ask questions.. you'll get more confused.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2011<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Enjoyed the class.  She made things very clear and easy by providing step by step worksheets.  I would take her again.  And she's good looking in an indie sort of way.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2011<br>Class Name: ECON320<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher at DePaul. Easy A- take home midterm, weekly quizzes which you get two attempts at, group presentation as final. I learned nothing- she would write info on board only to erase, saying she made a mistake, and would then write the correct information. I truly believe she is an embarrassment to the University.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2011<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>easy class, but shes super rude. she completely ruined my quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2011<br>Class Name: ECO320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really enjoyed this class. Attendance isn't mandatory but you may miss one of her quizzes. The readings are simple yet informative. No midterm, just worksheets, project (2 people), and a final paper. Terkun responded via email quickly and always was there to help with any question I had. Recommended for anyone needing to take an ECO elective!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2010<br>Class Name: MACRO102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a nice women. about 32 years old. Macro is transformed into a visual stimulate when you take Terkun(but shes married). Homework most days but its just questions at the end of each chapter. 3 multiple choice test. one final. very straight forward.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2010<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was a great professor! Highly recommend. She was so clear when going over the chapters, and the homework she makes us do from the book really helps with understanding what you read. Yes, the class required you to do work, but it wasn't anything too difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2010<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher to have. Cares about students and makes sure everyone is within pace. Tests are not the easiest but her format of mandatory HW is very helpful</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2010<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very straightforward course. No surprises when it comes to whats on the tests! Go over her powerpoints and you will be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2010<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Prof. Class is extremely easy. Consists of 3 exams, a final, and hmwrk/attendance. Can only miss 2 classes, but if you get an A on the 3 exams, you don't have to take the midterm! She makes econ really easy to understand and relates it to real world examples. HW is just the review questions at end of chapter. Def recommend!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2010<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a nice professor. Her hw is easy. I learned a lot in her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2010<br>Class Name: ECO320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is incredibly nice, helpful, and interesting. I highly recommend this class! You have to read lots, attend, but it's an easy class in that it's interesting and she makes it easy to follow.  Take this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/18/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a hard class, study, get A's on the three tests, and you don't have to take the final. Attendance is unfortunately mandatory. She's clear with what she's teaching but the class is pretty dry-- not really the professor's fault, I'm pretty sure this is the case with any econ class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you study, you should get an A or B. Its not a hard class really. Theres hw due every class, but theyre just questions based on the chapter you read. You can skim and find the answers if you dont want to read. 3 exams and a final = 80% of grade. HW=10%, Atten.=10%. No final if you get As on the 3exams, hw, and atten.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2009<br>Class Name: ECO306<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You have no credibility when you can't even spell your professor's name. She is not the best teacher in the world but I can see that some of you are not geniuses either. I will take here again if needed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2009<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Another REAL REVIEW.  Turken is not that great of a teacher.  She really is mean spirited like others said (although not always).  She uses the PPT slides from the book and barely updates any of them (and won't give them to you before class to take notes). Her pop quizzes are ridiculous and bring down your grade.  Avoid if possible. I got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2009<br>Class Name: ECO306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She really explains econ very well.  Love her.  Her Religion in Econ (eco 320) class is great as well.  Take her if you hate econ but have to learn it.  She'll make you understand it!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ok, a REAL RATING. terkun teaches her class as if they were in elementary school. BUT, she's clear and gives easy homework. straightforward in her rules and expectations. tests weren't too bad either. i wouldn't take her again though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/24/2009<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dear Prof. Terkun, You are absolutely the best professor I have ever had. You are the only reason I advise others at the  Eye Bank where I work to attend DePaul. Your class helped me better understand managerial decision making issues in the real world. You are absolutely the BEST and I am glad to see you are back teaching at DePaul this year!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/18/2009<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dear Prof. Terkun, You were absolutely the worst professor I have ever had.  You are the only reason I advise others at the I-Bank which I work to avoid DePaul and go to NW or Chicago. Your class polluted my mind and never related to the real world. If DePaul fires you, I may recommend the school. Sincerely, Every Student You Have Ever Had In Class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2009<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow, I cannot believe how one disgruntled slacker keeps posting negative comments about the quizzes! My opinion is that she is one of the best Economics professors at DePaul. The class quizzes that which are designed to encourage preparedness and negatively affect grades of slackers. Test are fair. She is professional. I liked her and she is nice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2009<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow, I cannot believe all the comments!  My opinion is that all grad students should avoid this teacher, mainly because of her attitude toward students.  The class also (as you probably read) has useless quizzes that negatively affect grades. Test are fair.  I just did not like being talked down to. She also did not know how to answer questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/11/2009<br>Class Name: ECO320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Terkun is an outstanding economist, very knowledgeable and professional. I enjoyed her Econ of Religion and hope to take her again. Homework and exams covered course content. Quizzes were not counted but kept us prepared for discussions. She is really interesting. Not sure what the MBA 555 folks expect from an econ course but they seem whiny.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/10/2009<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree with the other raters.  One person is writing all of her positive reviews.  She sucks, period.  She is a vindictive person who should not be teaching. I got an A but I would rather have taken another professor who cares about his/her students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/13/2009<br>Class Name: ECON306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice lady. Explains thnigs clearly and slowly, fill in the blank quizzes are for our benifit(not graded. Test were moderatly difficult. Homework is graded but she is fair. I prefer her over some of the other econ profs. Just suits my learning style. I'm not sure what the econ 555 people are arguing about, but I'm taking her again in the fall</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/09/2009<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is my first post on rate my professor, but it seems obvious to me that someone keeps writing good things about Turken.  All of the posts are the same.  They keep calling other posters LOSERS and SLACKERS.  This lady sucks, plain and simple.  Do not take her. She should be teaching at Robert Morris (haha) and Turken would write her own reviews.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/02/2009<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The previous poster is so messed up. I was in the same class and I got a B. You failed. Why do such lame slackers think it is the profs who defend them&#63; Profs don't care what we post. I just don't want Prof Terkun to get stuck with a bunch of losers. It was awful to have to sit there and have a whiner like you moaning all the time. Terkun is good!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2009<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terkun (or one person) is definitely writing the good reviews.  If I had the choice between taking a class taught by Satan or Terkun, I would choose Satan.  She is so crazy that she writes her own &quot;rate my professors&quot; reviews.  That you tell you something.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/30/2009<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is one of the nicest people that I have met at DePaul. She really cares about her students. Course has 2 exams, homework, and quizzes. If you have questions, go to her office and chat. She really is an interesting woman. It is too bad that losers try to spoil her reputation, especially whiners who cannot get a good job. Take her and learn</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/30/2009<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stay away.  Terrible teacher.  If anyone is a slacker it is the Terk.  She is a really mean person and I cannot believe any student would truly want another student to take her.

You need to read before lectures and take notes and you'll do fine. If you get all A's on the 3 tests she gives, you dont have to take the final! it was an incentive that worked for me! I would have liked her to use slides more. I think she's writing some of the good reveiws too because they all sound the same & use SLACKER</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2009<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terkun is a good prof and good teacher. She knows her stuff and doesn't take crap from whiners who miss a grade that they say they ought to get or have always gotten. You do the work and do it well - you get a good grade. If you waste your time and don't study - you do not. Simple system of quizzes, homework & tests. Come prepared to learn!

Sure there are mental midgets who wish to be spoon fed easy A grades. Terkun ran the course in a professional manner and taught us  material we need to know to be able to apply econ successfully in our careers. Too many unprepared slackers in MBA program!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2009<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is by far the most poorly taught class so far into my MBA program. Terk does not care about the students and is rude. Cannot even answer simple questions in class. Has no idea how to relate concepts to &quot;real world&quot;.

Agree with most posters that she is the worst teach in the MBA program.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2009<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Terkun is the best econ prof at DPU. She is really understanding and cares about her students. She wants you to succeed and is available at all hours to review and explain in greater detail.

DPU needs to raise its standards and send losers to Robt Morris</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2009<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terkun is terrible.  Do not take her.  She is really mean to her students.  I think she is just mad at life.  She probably needs a man.  Terrible teacher.

It would be worse than the torture they are currently receiving!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2009<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Terkun is the best! I bet the one posting previously is having a bad year... as most of us in the class thought with the rants and screeches before and after class. Terkun is really on top of the material except when slackers slowed us down! Take her for any class. I only wish DePaul had a PhD in Business program.

I have no idea how anyone could learn anything from her. Teaches straight from the book and treats everyone terribly.  Her pop quizzes are nothing like the &quot;real world&quot;.

She knows her stuff and relates it to graduate students who are working in the field or hoping to work in Fin/Econ. The Acct/Mgt/Mktg losers always complain in this MBA program because they are such slackers. I got a B and was most greatful! Her tests are rigorous and her quizzes keep you prepared like the real world.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2009<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a good teacher but her tests/ quizzes are really hard. Home works are easy. She will make you feel like you are back in high school. Her quizzes are very hard and she has a strict attendance policy. She wont allow you to use your Ti 83 calculator. YOu will have to buy one of those basic calculators which does not have the square function</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Terkun is one of the best! She knows her stuff and really explains well. I plan on taking her this summer. I switched majors to economics after taking her intro courses. She is really a positive role model for women in the professions. She demands the best. Too many slackers at DPU so I appreciate her decision to use quizzes to motivate.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2009<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terkun is the consummate professional economist. She tries to motivate the slackers by giving quizzes that require one to study prior to coming to class. Professor knows that the whiners are intellectual midgets. I hope she maintains her standards. Doesn't DePaul stand for excellence and quality&#63; These should transfer to U of Phoenix and buy MBA!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2009<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really believe that Terkun wrote some of the reviews below!  Because the reviews that are talking about how great she is cannot be any of her students.  She is not very nice.  She is a bad teacher.  Her pop quizzes are ridiculous for grad students.  I would rather get a root canal operation than sit through her class again.  Stay away!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2009<br>Class Name: ECO305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is outstanding, one of my favorites in the Department. She used diverse methods to help students demonstrate learning. She is very positive and reinforces for success. Graded multiple choice heavier than problems on exams and gave quizzes which I thought were excellent. She should not negotiate or compromise  standards for slackers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2009<br>Class Name: ECON555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The homework she assigns is easy and not time consuming. You must read and participate. She gives pop quizzes frequently, which were difficult. It forces you to keep up with reading - however she balances that with relatively unchallenging exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2009<br>Class Name: ECO305<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Treated us like children.  Really insulting.  Made the concepts, which aren't difficult to begin with, super complicated.  She gives horrible quizzes that did not help my grade or preparation of the midterm/final.  She's nice but not flexible.  I felt like I was in high school again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2009<br>Class Name: ECO305<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Explained concepts with clarity.  Lectures incredibly dry and straight from textbook. Silly quizzes that involved fill in the blanks, something I haven't done since 3rd grade.  Graded multiple choice heavier than problem solving sections on exams, which I thought was unreasonable.  Nice lady but not willing to negotiate or compromise.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2009<br>Class Name: ECO305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Terkun is a good instructor that is well suited to teaching Intermediate Micro. The homework and exams are as to be expected. The only two complaints that I have are the silly quizzes (which are actually quite easy given proper preparation) and her way of administering the exams. Please give ALL instructions PRIOR to handing out the test.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2009<br>Class Name: ECON555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is easy if you follow the lecture, slides, and homework. I think she is prepared and knowledgeble on the subject, but lack of real world examples.  And she is helpful and responsive to questions. Midterm and final are multiple choice. most of students don't feel that pop quiz should be used to enforce attendance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2009<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She should not be teaching at grad level! Was in way over her head. Lecture's word for word from textbk. She wont provide slides b4 class even tho u can get them on text's wesbite.Very strict on attendance and silly rules. Weekly hw & aweful pop quizzes. Goes over & over again theories/charts but cant relate any of it to the real world.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2009<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her teaching style has both good and bad points.  She's good at communicating key principles (very clear and consice).  She manages classroom questions and discussions well.  Her policies are rigid and ucommonly detailed for a graduate level class.  Midterm and final are easy.  Pop quizzes are stressful, obscure, and hurt your overall grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely easy class.  Treats the class like it is at the high school level, so she is very clear when you don't get it. Personally, I thought her class was too slow-paced. Allows you to exempt the final exam if you have straight A's on previous tests.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2009<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've never heard a whinier bunch of grad students in my life.  Yes, she's probably better suited for an undergrad course, but by no stretch is she awful.  She assigns HW and gives quizzes--so what!  She'll get bad marks from students that are looking for an A with as minimal effort as possible.  Do the HW and the reading and you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2009<br>Class Name: ECON555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just a bad person, in general. Treats grad students like high schoolers. Is rude. Does not post slides or HW b4 class (can get slides online-search Dr. Willner). Test are OK. Gives crazy pop quizzes to make sure you attend. Makes DePaul's econ department look pathetic. She was never prepared for class. And I got an A and wish I did not take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is strict, but she explains the basic topics in a comprehensive manner.

She is very serious and expects you to work but everything is very straight forward and she is fair with assignments. There are three tests and if you get all A's you can skip the final.</div></div></div></body></html>
