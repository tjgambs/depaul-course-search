She challenges students to critically think and use statistical data to back up their arguments. Dr. Johnson will "tell you how it is" and some students do not appreciate the beauty in that privilege. Love her! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2015<br>Class Name: PSC218<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>The frustrating thing about Valerie Johnson is that she proudly wears her passion on her sleeve, yet breaks down when you dare challenge some of her beliefs. The place of a professor isn't to use class as a forum to prove that their opinions are 'right', but rather to open up constructive dialogue. She will shoot you down rudely if you disagree. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is not worth taking. For a sophomore seminar class you can choose so many more easier classes. You literally got to read every single text to pass. To top it all of, shes the chairman of the department so there's no one that can say anything to her.  Expects way too much from you and is very picky about everything. Do not take her!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2014<br>Class Name: PSC282<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's amazing.  Keep up with the readings cause they are essential.  Super interesting to listen to her opinions.  She always has great discussions going and encourages participation.  Just follow her guidelines for assignments and there is no reason you should't get an A.  She's intelligent and makes it very clear what she expects from you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2013<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>I know most of my peers didn't like her, and I can understand why.

She is ALWAYS willing to help her students.  Reading is essential in this class.  Some are long, others are short, but for the most part the readings are bearable and easy to understand.  The subject material is interesting.

Unfortunately I cannot swear on here otherwise she would be called every name in the book. It may sound like I am just disgruntled but do not say I did not warn you.

Even if a professor is bad most will help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Johnson displays genuine interest in her subject and hearingthe opinions of her students. 3 Video reviews, some quizzes on the readings, 7-9 pg research paper, and a take home final.

Great resource if you're interested in these topics. As was said before, 1 research paper, one test (take home final), and you can get away with little reading.

The final was hard, mainly because we barely discussed the textbook in class up until the last sessions. Talks a lot about current politics and class tended to revolve around those debates.

Yes, she's liberal and will debate you on issues but she can at least hold her own. I only wished more people would say something in the class.

She relied completely on student presentations to discuss the readings, which were assigned in an unorganized manner.

She was interesting and her corny jokes keep that class going. I have graduated from DePaul since I had her and she is still one of the BEST professors I had.
