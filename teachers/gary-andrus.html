Tried so so hard and did bad. He grades extremely hard and you HAVE to teach EVERYTHING to yourself, some stuff you can't even teach yourself and just end up failing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/15/2010<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By the end of the course I hadn't learned anything from this guy I couldn't have found online. Definitely one of the worst professors I've ever had as far as being an actual instructor goes. But if you want an incredibly easy A, take this course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2010<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sweet guy, but the way he covers the material is unclear. Class isn't engaging whatsoever and the PowerPoints weren't too helpful either. Attendance is not mandatory, but it's needed in order to complete in-class assignments, which are always in groups. If you pay close attention (which is hard to do), there's no way you won't get an A or high B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2010<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A likeable professor but doesn't seem to be able to understand when or why students don't get the material--also has a difficult time explaining and making his thought processes clear. Lectures are generally confusing and frustrating for both the students and himself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2009<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fantastic teacher.  Very friendly and easy going, presents material in a very casual mannter but does so in an engaging way.  There is very little interaction with the students (does not ask students a lot of questions), but he keeps everyone's attention on him.  I would definitely seek out more of his classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2008<br>Class Name: ISP121<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do exactly what he says and there is no way you won't do well. The bad thing he never explains things, so the final sucks. I would necessarly recommend him, but you could do worst. hope you like captain underpant!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2007<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this guy is awsome.  I dont know much about java and css but he always helped me out.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2007<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was awesome!! Helped us create the pages we needed to do in class! He would sit with us until we figured everything out and even correct our mistakes after he found them. Comes on a little strong but he eases up and is amazing. The midterm is a little rough but I should have studied for it. Fun class, attendance isnt mandatory.... coolest guy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2006<br>Class Name: IT223DL<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I did most of the learning from the book and homework, but did watch and learn from some of the classes. Midterm, open book multiple choice, was shmeasy. Final was open book, but much more difficult -I should have brought a calculator. Doing the homework is difficult if you don't have the software.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2006<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome prof! This is the third class I have taken with him, and he is just amazing! He makes the topics easy to understand, and tests you on your ability to find an answer and work the problems, not your ability to memorize! A great prof I recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2006<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Andrus knows his stuff you just have to know how to get it out of him.  He is very funny, but you do have to be self-disciplined enough to teach yourself alot of the course. He will help you with anything you don't understand and does answer emails fairly quickly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2005<br>Class Name: JAVA<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rarely ever answers emails. Has a grader look at the homework for him so he can't really give you feedback. Classes are lecture based, your better off skipping class and studying on your own.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2005<br>Class Name: IT130HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Granted I took this professor twice, but only bc I didn't have to go to class.  If you're looking to teach yourself, then go for it!  Don't expect to learn too much from him. Unless you understand his language you'll be lost after day 1.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2005<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He expects you to know java before you enroll. Im really into computers and all that, and have had a small class in programming, but he is extremely unclear.. only talks to himself.. and doesnt explain much. The only reason it was easy is becuase you dont need to attend class and you can view the class online, but this doesnt help much</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/24/2005<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome funny guy, for those who understand a bit about Java. For those who don't know Java, class is hard and they think it's a waste of time and money. Easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2005<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gary is a great guy, funny and just makes class fun but fails to teach basic java. This is ok if you aren’t looking to make a life out of programming, but those that are take heed. This class is mostly taught through code modification, he will show an example and then you change it to work with your</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2005<br>Class Name: CSC383<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take him only if you don't care about learning anything while still getting a good grade.  His sense of humour will definitely not help you in later classes that depend on your knowledge of data structures.  Doesn't prepare class notes, barely writes anything on the board, just sits and talks.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2004<br>Class Name: SCIENCE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2004<br>Class Name: CSC383<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i am very neutral on the course that i took with the teacher. it didn't seem like it was very necessary (as others in the computer science department will tell you). the professor, on the other hand, was very interesting..very unique sense of humor. i would recommend him to all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2004<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Homework is challenging for &quot;non computer science majors&quot;.

First off, tells the stuents you do not have to be in class if you dont want to. Answers his e-mails in the evening, about the time students are working on homeworks. Very little homeworks, about 5 assignments. Study guide for tests!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2004<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is the best teacher for this course.  he will help you with your projects and he gives extra credit when he see's that you are doing bad.  test are simple you have the notes and he never test on anything that he has not given an example for.</div></div></div></body></html>
