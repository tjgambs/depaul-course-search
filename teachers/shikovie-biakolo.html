Mostly discussion based class. Opened my eyes to issues like Monsanto's GMOs, White Privilege, and other socially relevant problems in our society. Really not that difficult of a class. Few papers, no tests, and she even offers to edit your papers and give you feedback before submitting them. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2014<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very pretentious. Intelligent and well-versed on the subject, but does not allow room for critical thinking. Looks for specific answers and does not accept otherwise. Basically a class on racism rather than intercultural communications. I don't feel the material she provided will help me at all, even though its a required class.</div></div></div></body></html>
