He knows what he's talking about, is funny, and really wants his students to succeed. I loved his class, even though the subject wasn't always the most interesting. Yes there is work involved but he is super chill and none of it is incredibly hard. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2013<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly, Schultz is one of the best professors I've had so far at DePaul. The guy is awesome, which I learned even more so after going on the First Year Abroad program to Jordan with him. The class was hard work, but fair and interesting, and then the trip itself was incredible. With anyone else, it wouldn't have been as good. Take his classes!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2011<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>professor schultz is such an amazing professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2011<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>We covered The First Crusades, which isn't the easiest subject to understand but we read 3 books, 2 at the same time. He covered the subject very well, and let us use our notes for the midterm. However, he explains the material with clarity. There are 4 papers, the first two easy, and the last two, maybe more effort but he always offers help!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2007<br>Class Name: HST365<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great guy and a great teacher. Be prepared for a lot of reading, but as long as you're on top of it you'll do fine. Also, lots of discussion in this class - so be prepared to talk! He's an entertaining/funny guy with lots to say about the subject he's teaching. He's also very approchable and easy to contact.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2006<br>Class Name: HST199<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's really good, helpful, easy grader</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2006<br>Class Name: HST199<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Schultz is an awesome teacher; negative comments made about him are likely coming from people who don't feel they should have to work hard to get a good grade.  If you show him you are serious, he will go out of his way to help you.  There is a lot of work outside of class, but you actually learn.  Best prof I've had in three years at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2006<br>Class Name: MUSLIMWORLD1<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He moved very slowly in this course.  I didn't find the material particularly interesting, mostly due to his approach.  However, he's a very easy grader and a very nice man so grades don't suffer for it.  He really does want his students to succeed and have an interest in the topic and that shows.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2006<br>Class Name: STUDYABROAD<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>warren is the best!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2005<br>Class Name: HST<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great professor and person</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2005<br>Class Name: HST199<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TERRIBLE teacher. He does not see when he is wrong and gets an attitude when you try to tell him differently.  he has a boring class and makes terrible jokes.  he takes forever to grade papers as well.  stay on top of your grade or he will screw up your GPA.  plus his assingments are boring unless you like priest's asian mission.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2005<br>Class Name: HST199<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Scultz is a good teacher. He is very knowledgable about History and truly has a grasp of how to onvey his knowledge to the students. I really enjoyed this class, even though it required alot of work. I do agree that he takes forever to give grades. His is the last one I'm waiting on for this semester. Otherwise, he is highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2005<br>Class Name: HON103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! Knows his class may not be the most interesting so makes lots of jokes about it. Lots of reading, but discussed in class. He's genuinely interested in helping you learn. Two papers and a midterm is about as much work there is beyond the reading. Learned a lot from this class and would definitely take a class with him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2005<br>Class Name: HON103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome, awesome, awesome.

Professor Schultz is an awesome teacher, who is genuinely intested in what he teaches and his students. The class is challenging, with lots of reading, but you will learn tons. His tests are fair, as is his grading. He is knowledgeble as well as interesting. He's a good one!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2005<br>Class Name: HST398ISTANBUL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Schultz is so insightful and genuinely helpful. The midterm was easy - you will do well if you actually do the readings and have a lucid comprehension of the material.

He was a little disorganized this last term and missed about 5 classes. Needs to hand out discussion questions BEFORE class. Does a very good job of providing timelines etc to keep the many characters straight. A stickler for rubrics for papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2005<br>Class Name: HST365<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent- engaging and v. intelligent.

You cover the pyramids to modern day Egypt in ten weeks. A bit of a stretch and hurried.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2004<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very passionate about this subject.

The class can be boring at times especially if you're not interested in The Arabian Nights. There is not a lot of work.  Don't read the assignments because he goes over everything in class. His grading is kind of tough, but it's easy to get an A or B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2004<br>Class Name: HST199<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Schultz is great.
