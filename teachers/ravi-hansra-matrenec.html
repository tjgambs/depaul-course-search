It's overwhelming. Two students dropped the course. She makes you work with classmates in your content area, which is helpful, but not so helpful when you're the only one in your content area. The professor is great. She's to the point and prepares you for the real world. DO THE STRATEGY LOGS!

I learned so much and developed my love for teaching. She knows what she's talking about since she has taught in the high school before. I found her to be very helpful even meeting with me multiple times outside of class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2014<br>Class Name: SEC325<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Heavy textbook use but these books are amazing and make sure to buy not rent. Strategy logs are a drag but useful if you do them. Hansra is awesome, understanding, and a great resource. The work can be overwhelming but it's manageable, if you stay on top of it. Great class discussions and projects. Not a class to take if you have senioritis...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2014<br>Class Name: TL525<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The literacy course is the best education course in the entire program. I found all assignments useful. They were sometimes challenging, but useful for teaching. I am now teaching and rely on what we learned in this course daily. Dr. Hansra has also been a great resource for me now that I am teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/07/2013<br>Class Name: TL525<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Hansra's Literacy class was one of the best I've taken at DePaul. The books are extremely helpful. She asks to lesson plan in a different way but it has helped me to think about how my lesson plans are linked to standards. This was a meaningful class that I wished I had taken sooner in the program.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/29/2013<br>Class Name: TL428<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was the most helpful methods class I've taken so far.
