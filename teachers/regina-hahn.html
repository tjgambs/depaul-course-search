If you can deal with this, she is actually a great teacher. If you ever ask for help she goes above and beyond. And was very involved with everything helped german club alot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2005<br>Class Name: GER101AND102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hahn is very clear.  She spells the language out for you, so you can be solid on the rules.  She doesn't assign a lot of homework, keeps the tests reasonable.  One of the best teachers I've had at this school.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: GER104105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What is it about the syllabus&#63;! You really have to be EXTREMELY slow in order not to understand it. Hahn's a great professor. She's willing to help and she has a great personality. I hated german, but her class is actually fun. If you get how to work in her class you'll do fine.. Psh..the syllabus..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: GER104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible Terrible class.  I thought german would be my minor but after this class I don't plan to take another german class here as she teaches 104-106.  She is unclear and uneffective in teaching.  I warn you not to waste your time with this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very political and horrible at grading. doesn listen to students ever!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2004<br>Class Name: GER104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sometimes misjudges skills/expects too much, syllabus was horribly confusing and she gave us 3 different drafts through the quarter, but she means well, is accessible outside of class, is patient (explained syllabus just about every class period), and quite pleasant!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2004<br>Class Name: GER101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I could have taught myself better.

She makes the compositions 'gimme points' since she tells you hwo to fix them before she grades them (easy A).  Her tests aren't that bad, just review what she tells you to.  And, learn to like her, DPU has a tiny German department, so you're kinda stuck w/ her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2004<br>Class Name: GER104106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ridiculously picky grader, takes things personally, at times unprofessional with befriending students.  Unable to acknowledge making a mistake.  She's just going through the motions and doesn't care to be teaching anymore (and recently did not get tenure).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2004<br>Class Name: ENGLISH10<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes is the worst teacher i have ever had!!!! dont bother trying your hardest you still will get a bad grade!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2004<br>Class Name: GER104106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is hypocritical, expects you to make up classes that she misses but won't let you make up ones that you miss, her teaching is ineffective, she is unable to reason and rationalize with students...UGH...Don't do it I'm warning you!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2004<br>Class Name: FCLPT<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2004<br>Class Name: GER102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hated this teacher, I loved taking german and planned on having it as my minor.
