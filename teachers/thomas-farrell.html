He will always help you, cares about students, and makes it easy as possible to get a good grade. Really the only thing I need to say to prove he is excellent is that his Saturday morning classes surpass 30 people, and sometimes get maxed out.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/02/2013<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Farrell is the MAN! Probably one of the better math teachers ive come across. His stats class consisted of 8 quizzes (drops 2) 1 midterm, and 1 final. If midterm grade is low, then he substitutes it with the next 2 quiz grades. Final is cumulative. Granted its not exactly a cakewalk, but do your work and you should come out with a B. Great Prof!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2013<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Farrell is a pretty good person! Easy content, clear stating and simple homework. You will just have 8 quizzes and each of them come from the homework you did. Midterm and Final are pretty easy. I highly recommend you to choose him! He is pretty nice and takes care of everybody!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/05/2012<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took him SPR '12 & he was a nice guy. All the quizzes & tests are straight out of the book, but honestly you don't really need it. He assigns hw but doesn't collect it. The class consists of going over last week's hw, quiz, a small break, & going over new material for that week's hw. It's a 3hr class on a Sat but you can leave early if you want.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2011<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Here's the skinny: He is a good professor who loves to make graphs for every problem in the textbook even though it doesn't require one. Quizzes/mid-term are easy (just make sure you get perfect scores on these) and his final was a curve ball to everybody. The final will drop your grade if you get about 5 out of 20 wrong so be extremely wary.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2011<br>Class Name: CALC135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>cool teacher, makes the material as clear as possible taking him again for 136... just wish it wasnt a saturday class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2010<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't you hate BS reviews&#63; Wanna know if this class is an easy A or not&#63; Here's the review: If you work hard you will get a B. Otherwise you are looking at a C or a D. To get an A you would have to get MAX points on weekly quizzes (8 total quizzes 20 pts each,6 best count for 120 pts)then ATLEAST 60/80 on the Final. [Hard A, Challenging B, Easy C,]</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2010<br>Class Name: BMS326<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rating on 3/16/09 is dumb. How is that possible when he gives you his HOME PHONE NUMBER to call him anytime of the week&#63; Mr. Farrell is a great teacher, and if you are rating him down it's because you aren't good at math. His teaching skills are great and it's literally impossible to fail his class. Drops mid term if you do good on quizzes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2009<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Farrell is a wonderful teacher. He is willing to go over thr problems with you before and after class. You can even call him at home if you need help. BMS 126 was really easy as long as you practice the problems he assigns.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2009<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He does not help!

This guy is AWESOME! If you dont pass his class you just failed it cause YOU wanted to. Teaches Crystal Clear. Quizzes weekly, MT and Final. If you take all his quizzes you get to drop the midterm (which either way was easy casue he jsut combined all the quizes same for Final) Overall I WOULD TAKE HIM AGAIN!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Entered wrong rating in the previous entry</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take him!! He is a good prof wants to make sure student understand and do well in his class. He is there to help if need be. Weekly quizes, mid-term, final. If u do well in the quizes you'll be able to drop the midterm exam. Final is 40% of your grade. Flexible if you put effort in to the class. Easy to get B or higher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/29/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would definitely recommend him despite the fact that his classes are on saturday. You will enjoy it if you do take it. I didn't want to just because it was saturday, but after I started taking the class I think I made a really good choice. He gives quizzes out every week to freshen up our memories with the materials. He's a good teacher overall.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2007<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>extremely helpful professor. He knows what is necessary to teach, so that reduces tons of works for students. explain everything perfectly clear. patient and funny sometimes. Helpful outside the class too. only teaches on Saturday. Easy class too, logical grading. If you do everything he tells you to do, easy to get high grade. STRONGLY recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2007<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I absolutely love this professor. He really cares about his students and makes the class very easy. He is super clear and helpful. There is no excuse for not getting an A!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2007<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a long class I understand but he is great! Every sat it is the same thing no suprises and if you do the hw which is not required then you know what is on the quiz b/c the quiz is based on 4&#63;s off the hw and he goes over hw before the quiz.  Easy A if you go to lectures and do the quizez easy grading VERY HELPFUL when in need.I urge to take </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2007<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.   Took Tom Farrell for 125,126, and 142.  There are no surprises with him.  Weekly quizes, and exams are the straight off homework and quizes.  Do your homework, come to class, and get good grades.  He does not have unrealistic expectations.  I highly recommend him to anyone who has trouble with this subject matter, he always helps.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2007<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked him. I took calc in high school so this was more of a review, but still. There are 8 quizes, one every class, and he drops the 2 lowest ones. Then the final is like 30% of your grade. Problems on the quizes and finals are all homework problems. You undersand your homework and it's an easy A. Homework is all from the book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2006<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>not a good teacher final is just too hard everybody fails</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/12/2006<br>Class Name: BUSMATH<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Does not allow calculator usage, wants everything done manually.
