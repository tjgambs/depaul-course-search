I aced the tests (as in 99%+) but he would shave points off participation and presentations with no explanation. I was literally 1.3 points away from a an 'A'. He does this often.

Midterm and final are open book/open note online. There is a presentation on a country he assigns you, but it's really easy and it's only for like five minutes. His lectures are really boring though, so you would have to get through a three hour lecture even though it's an easy class.

His lectures have nothing to do with the quizzes. All quizzes are online, from book, but are pretty hard. Sorta nice b/c he doesn't believe in memorization.

The entire class revolved around writing a paper that wasn't assigned in the syllabus. And not even the content of the paper, but research methods and proper citation. The worst MBA class I have taken - complete waste of time and money. Felt like I was back in H.S.

His teaching style has changed, according to some of my friends he was much easier in the past. Takes a weird attendace (takes your picture.)

No mid-term or Finale.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2006<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Succari is great! I wish I could take him for my other classes. His lectures are OK, the amount of work is reasonable. Takes attendance. He is a fair grader and always available after class if you have any questions.
