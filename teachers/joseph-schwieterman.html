He is a cutie!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2012<br>Class Name: MPS571<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Joe gets a low score only in clarity because the syllabus wasn't a reflection of the class at all-he would change projects mid-way through which was frustrating.  He is, however, incredibly knowledgeable about all things planning-related and it's a treat to attend his lectures!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2011<br>Class Name: MPS542<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His expectations are unreasonable because he does not teach in a structured manner. He does not follow his syllabus. He does not teach with clarity and there is little room for in-class questions. However, he does make himself available for individual meetings.  If you learn better in a structured environment, I suggest you don't take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2011<br>Class Name: MPS573<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Joe's study abroad course in Curitiba, Brazil and loved it! Not only because of the trip, but Joe set clear expectations, made the class interesting and challenging, and got me really excited about urban planning. He is extremely passionate about his field and instills that passion into his students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/27/2011<br>Class Name: MPS573<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Joe's an expert at Urban Planning/Transit, so pay attn?he's a fantastic resource. He assigns a LOT of reading, but is clear about what he wants. Participation is key for an A & DON'T slack off in this class. Every tool needed to succeed is literally handed to you (ie. study guides)?NO excuses. Take any planning class he teaches?you'll learn a ton.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/11/2010<br>Class Name: MPS542<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Joe is great, very knowledgeable, very accessible given how busy he is. Wants you to actually learn and not just slide through. I appreciate that he has higher standards than some profs at SPS--this is graduate school after all. Only complaint is that our midterm included a lot of fact memorization and not as much synthesis.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2010<br>Class Name: PPS329<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful. Very involved in community so if you want to learn something useful, take this class with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2009<br>Class Name: PPSTRAN<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher. Very nice guy.  Not boring.  Intelligent.  i liked the class with him...he's pretty laid back and cool for the most part..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2008<br>Class Name: MPS542<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Joe is a great professor and always willing to go the extra mile for his students.  He's always accessible via email or phone.  The topics we covered weren't the easiest, but his goal was to make sure that everyone understood and comprehended what we were doing.  I don't think there's any better professor at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2008<br>Class Name: FINAN542<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor who is very interested in the class and the students. I've taken multiple classes with him and enjoyed every one.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2007<br>Class Name: MPS520<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Finance</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2005<br>Class Name: PPS<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A superb and ecentric professor. He is very passionate about transporation issues. If you take class notes and ask for help then you are sure to learn a lot and recieve a deserving grade. Very aproachable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2005<br>Class Name: PPS202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's not a bad guy, he's just an awkward academic. He moves at the wrong pace and, he didn't really know how to reach his goals. We did a lot of math and it was mostly stuff you see when you have to take Stats if you're a PPS major. The stuff he knows about (transportation issues) could be kind of interesting. He Should just talk about that.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/11/2005<br>Class Name: PPS202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the most self-involved teacher out there.  Most classes are about what he has done, while at the same time he is so confusing with his inability to teach that everyone is simply lost.</div></div></div></body></html>
