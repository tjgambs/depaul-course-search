I enjoyed his class even though it was filled with intensive reading and short papers that were very intense. The most amazing thing is that he was always there to help. He made the class fun otherwise it would have been a boring history class. To enjoy this class participation from students is important.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2015<br>Class Name: LSP<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he makes you read a lot. he is funny and inspirational. taking him changed my mind about history. i never liked history nor i like reading but Prof. Beiriger makes this class fun and interesting. TAKE HIM.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2015<br>Class Name: HST249<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've never enjoyed a single history class I ever took until I took one with Beiriger. He's truly so passionate about the subject he teaches and wants his students to succeed. Yes, there is a lot of reading, but he makes sitting through lectures enjoyable as he tells history in a story-like manner. Wish I could take another class with him!! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2014<br>Class Name: HST249<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: P</div><div id="right"><div>Issues a lot of reading but his class was enjoyable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2014<br>Class Name: HST249<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Beiriger is the best! He is passionate about the topics he teaches, he is super helpful, and does not give BS work. He also grades papers fast, which I appreciate from professors.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2013<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very intelligent professor. I took the focal point that he taught about heroes in literature, and it was awesome. Yes, there was a lot of reading, but they are fast reads and extremely enjoyable, and his discussions force you to really think about the topics. There are only three papers and no midterm or final. Take this focal point!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2012<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a nice guy, subtle bias towards being a democrat (eh, DePaul people..) but really interested in everything that he does. It is impossible to keep up on the reading, the few assignments he has are rather difficult, but if you put in the effort it pays off. He is very helpful, and the definition of a great professor; He wants you to LEARN!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2011<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took a class on the leaders of World War II and enjoyed every minute of it. Dr. Beiriger is extremely knowledgeable about his subject, does a great German accent, and is more than willing to help you out if you have questions with a paper. The reading schedule is extremely rigorous and somewhat difficult material but he's a fairly easy grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2010<br>Class Name: HST274<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The professor is very good but his lectures are very boring. I would reccomend to take him if you need a history credit. The class consists of 3 papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/24/2010<br>Class Name: HAA239<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the best teacher at DePaul hands down.  The only one I have rated on here. He is so knowledgable and fun, he makes you want to go to class. He is really helpful too if you are struggling. I would recommend this class even for those not interested.  This class, intelligence in the 19th century is his specialty too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2010<br>Class Name: HST250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved him! Extremely helpful outside of the class, will give you the help you need. Lots of reading but you can get away with not reading everything. He will have random HILARIOUS comments that cracked me up! The reading and dull lectures are the only downside. 3 papers- just read enough to write the paper and give some effort & youll be fine!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2009<br>Class Name: HST250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. Probably the best I've ever had at DePaul so far. He knows a lot about his subject and can answer any question. Easy grader with only 3 papers as your grade so you need to make them count. I guarantee you will walk out of his class having learned way more about the subject than you knew.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2009<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's such a sweetheart.  He know everything about the topic and is very clear in his objectives.  I'm not really interested in history but actually enjoyed his lectures and learned a lot.  There were 3 papers each worth 25% so it's a good class for bad test takers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2009<br>Class Name: HST298<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredible teacher.  Would take him again and again.  The man knows everything about everything that has to do with the subject matter.  You can skim the books to write your papers (which are easy, and very fairly graded).  Makes class a blast.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2008<br>Class Name: HST250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was a great professor who really cared a lot about the subject. All history majors should take him. He was not that hard of a grader at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's hard.  A lot of reading and 3 papers are practically your entire grade.  He is pretty boring but nice guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2008<br>Class Name: HST250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy, great stories, reading intensive.  I cannot stress enough how much reading there is.  He's a fair grader.  3 papers, no midterm or final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2008<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you love History, Eugene is your man! His corny jokes can get annoying at times, but he cares about his students. His essay assignments require a little more, but, if you give it, he will reward you. A very convincing mustache!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's so entertaining. He gets so excited about little things in the class. He lectures a lot, but his lectures are important material for writing the papers so I haven't missed a class yet. He's a pretty strict grader, but you'll learn a lot and it's   interesting.  Also A LOT of reading, but it's doable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2008<br>Class Name: HST250<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is a great guy.  The class was extremely interesting and he makes it very clear about what he expects from you on papers.  However, you must keep up with reading and there is quite a bit of it.  If you won't read, don't take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2007<br>Class Name: HST397<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor.

Tons of class discussion, high-level debate...and did I mention this was a freshman class&#63; Stimulating through and through.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/09/2007<br>Class Name: HIST249<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOME teacher! made the class very interesting if you love history you will LOVE his class :-)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2007<br>Class Name: HST268<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Beiriger is AMAZING!!!  I loved every minute (that I was awake) of his class!  It is a lot of lecture (hence the occassional nap) but SO interesting.  Can't wait to take another one of his classes!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2007<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is such a sweetheart! Very analytical guy, he thinks about everything very deeply. A lot of lecture though, but he is not difficult at all!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2007<br>Class Name: HST249<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>extremely nice guy.  lectures for entire class, but tries to keep it interesting.  has quirky sense of humor, but it usually made me laugh to myself.  willing to meet with students before/after class.  he does tend to talk quietly, so make sure to ask him to speak up.  also, be warned: its a reading intensive class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2006<br>Class Name: HST274<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor I've had so far at DePaul.  Very helpful, great sense of humor! Two things to keep in mind, though: he speaks very quietly, and if you are in a night class, he takes attendence after the break, but I strongly recommend him, he rocks!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was great teacher and really helpful in understanding the concepts that are behind today’s world.  I was not interested in the material but his lectures were told in such a way that you will remember everything he said. There are 3 papers each worth25%.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2006<br>Class Name: HST268<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. B is a wonderfully nice guy.  He's very good with answering questions and a terribly easy grader.  A great class and a great professor.  He does talk quietly so ask him to speak up in a large lecture hall.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2005<br>Class Name: HST272<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class could have been extremely interesting had he approached it differently. He merely stands in front of class and lectures the entire time. It is hard to connect his lectures with the readings because he jumps around a lot. Also assigns way too much reading - required to buy 6 books. I wouldn't take him again.</div></div></div></body></html>
