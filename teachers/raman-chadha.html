I'm sure said twists seem creative in his head (made apparent by the self-satisfied smile in his face when he brings them up), but they are simply annoying and contribute nothing to the learning experience. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2014<br>Class Name: MGT570<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very poor quality of teaching. Waste of time and money. He is clueless about what he teaches and is totally unprepared for class. Avoid this class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2014<br>Class Name: MGT570<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want to learn from textbooks/case studies and do a regular business plan than this course is not for you. If you want to explore how to open a business in the real world with lots of outside class work that can benefit your start-up then you will love this course. Tough class with a lot of outside work but very beneficial at the end.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2013<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is very easy. Not much outside of class work besides a few discussion questions. You get three full weeks of in class time to work with your group on your project, which is awesome.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are interested in the subject & don't need this specific class, you can save  your money. You'll likely get more value out the texts by Steve Blank and Ash Maurya.  Older comments still accurate.  You are mostly on your own to figure this out. His knowledge and connections are strengths. Sharing this knowledge and coaching are weaknesses.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2012<br>Class Name: MGT370<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed the real-world feel of this class. Most entrepreneurship courses give the perception that starting a business is something you can learn from a textbook. Raman provides a realistic environment where students learn based their entrepreneurial attitudes on a system of assuming, testing, learning, applying, and redoing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2009<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Chadha is the best professor in the Management Department!!!He is brilliant and makes an interesting and interactive class where DePaul Students are actually challenged.   I cant believe the poor ratings people put, Chadha does not like mediocrity and if want to slack off for the rest of your life dont take chadha or speak to people like him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2006<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. Knows what he is talking about. The class is designed to make you work outside of class. He expects you to run a business, which is good practice... also he has alot of connections.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/31/2006<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible Man. Horrible Class.  He gives hours of busy work each week.  The class is easy if you do not mind spending hours and hours each week for the class.  No midterm or final. but there are 4 quizs.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2006<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2006<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE! The class is worth 1000 points and he actually has assignements worth 25 points. Then his quizes are aweful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2006<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is horrible. He gives quizzes on readings he has not taught. His lectures only pertain to the project slightly. You are treated as free labor. I learned little to nothing. I am an A student and I hated the class. Also I showed concern for my group early on and he did not care and gave me a lower grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/12/2005<br>Class Name: ICP394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher...

HIS QUIZZES ARE TRICKY.  YOU HAVE TO READ THE ASSIGNED CHAPTERS AND HE GIVES YOU A QUIZ ON IT BUT DOESNT ACTUALLY TEACH THE MATERIAL BEFORE THE QUIZ. YOUR KINDA ON YOUR OWN. HE SHOWS MOVIES AND HAS GUEST SPEAKERS SO PRETTY MUCH HE GETS PAID TO DO NOTHING.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2005<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher, challenging assignments and tests, but interesting class, and he knows his stuff!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2005<br>Class Name: ECS<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DONT FALL ASLEEP cause he'll yell your name out in class!

I had so much fun in his class! Readings and an essay but not hard at all.  We even played some games. He is so nice and is always ready to help. To get an A just do HW and participate in class. Definitely take him (in summer)!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2004<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very very cocky, not a horrible grader but he is so cocky its sick</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2004<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Quarter long group project is very time consuming, but very helpful.

He invloves the class and makes them think. He gives you real life examples. He is very knowledgable about the subject. He also pushes you very hard and is there if you have any questions. Test are hard though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2004<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOME PROFESSOR!!!
