Class was great based on some of the material.  I really want to be a teacher and love DePaul but she is not a good professor.  Choose any other teacher if you can.  Gives too many pointless lectures and powerpoints. Does not teach very thoroughly & skips main points but touches on pointless details.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/02/2008<br>Class Name: BBE446<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Soltero is loved by blonde, suburban women who don't know anything about being a person of color in the public education system. She is unwilling to consider views that do not coincide with her own and is brusque about it. Her session are full of powerpointless presentations and interesting facts about language.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2006<br>Class Name: TL413<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2006<br>Class Name: TL413<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Soltero is definately my favorite professor.  She is very knowledgeable and willing to share that with her students.  At first the class seemed overwhelming, but she really helped the class through everything.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2006<br>Class Name: TL413<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is wonderful!

She is thorough, extremely knowledgable, and has tons of practical ideas and lessons you can actually use. A+!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2006<br>Class Name: EDUCATION<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hands down, the best professor that I ever had!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2004<br>Class Name: BBE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the greatest professors I have ever had in my life.  She is over qualified to be teaching at DePaul.  Really knows her stuff and how to relay the information to her students.  She will help you even after the class is over. Dedicated, passionate, and intelligent. Hard but fair.</div></div></div></body></html>
