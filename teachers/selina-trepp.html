Normally, we just turn in the assigned projects and have the opportunity to redo them for a better grade. However, she criticizes a lot when she critique our work. There is a downside of the assignments where it  takes more than 6 hours to get it finish-especially at the CDM.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2015<br>Class Name: 101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty easy class but very time consuming. You will spend hours on projects. Really nice and an easy grader in my opinion. No tests or quiz. class is mainly projects, turn them in on time and you can redo them and fix them anytime for a better grade </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2015<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Students were required to rentbuy a textbook that was never used for any assignments. Professor Trepp's critique of projects was often too specific and commonly rude, which would be tolerable if the class wasn't for Non-Majors. Lectures ran too long. Avoid taking this class with Professor Trepp.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2015<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is not that hard. Just required more time and effort on the animation projects. I spend almost  7 hours for completing the project. Not hard, but requires more time to get it completed in a timely manner. If you are looking for an easy A, this class is NOT for you. Avoid taking if you want just light work with small amount of time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2015<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took it because I thought it was be interesting to learn how to make short animations using Photoshop and After effects.  The class was pretty easy, don't think re-submissions means you can put off projects though. Lectures are 45 minutes too long, and sometimes confusing.  Seems to try to force the 1.5 hour long lecture. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2014<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is straight forward and it is very easy to make a good grade if you do all the work. She lets you resubmit projects for a higher grade any time before the end of the quarter. Only thing is the class is super boring and the projects are pretty tedious.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2013<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Selina Trepp is a great professor. She speaks clearly and gives advice to students that are stuck. Attendance is mandatory, but she gives 2 free passes. Her workload is short, but intense. This class is not recommended for those who want an easy A. Book is hardly ever used. TIME CONSUMING CLASS. Prepare to spend hours at the CDM.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2013<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She likes to over-critique non-majors' work. The book is hardly used. Her attitude is less than pleasant. I would definitely not recommend for those who expect an easy A, like I had.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2013<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First day impression: expects us to have experience on animating. (Its a non-major class) A lot of work to be done outside of class. Had to follow through her lectures over and over again on COL to meet expectations. Wouldn't say rude but as an artist, you must criticize everything to improve your work. Worked hard for a well deserved A!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2011<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow, expects you to become an instant expert in computer animation. I felt like she truly enjoyed criticizing student work from NON MAJORS. I asked her for help outside of class and she was kinda rude about helping. Definitely wouldn't recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2011<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The rudest professor I have ever had at DePaul. Homework assignments ate up A LOT of time outside of class. While the subject material was very interesting it would have been better with a more reasonable professor. Do not take!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2011<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It is an really interesing and useful class. But the homework takes a long time. You can resubmit the project. The grade is fair.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2011<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take this class.. especially not if you have a job or internship or other classes and dont want to be spending your free time drawing pictures for a non majors 101 course.. absolutely hated this class, waste of time and money</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2011<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR NON MAJORS. WAS WORRIED ABOUT FINALS FOR MY ACTUAL MAJOR AND HAD TO SPEND TIME ON A COMPUTER PROGRAM I DONT OWN IN THE LAB. HUGE MISTAKE.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2010<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Projects are enjoyable and very course-oriented, which makes leaving class with a smile normality.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2010<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is an awesome professor. taking this calls with her made me ad animation to my courses and my minor. the class was for non majors, and she was ONLY rude to the people who assumed the class was going to be an easy A and didnt care much for the class. if you have a genuine interest shes an awesome professor to take</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2010<br>Class Name: ART106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Selina is a somewhat new teacher to Depaul but she was already very good in ART 106. I definitely learned a LOT from her and genuinely enjoyed her class. But you need to put in a lot of time outside of class! She is not rude, just blunt and to the point. She is a very nice woman though and I would love to take more classes with her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2010<br>Class Name: ART106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Selina was one of my favorite profs this quarter. She wrote me an amazing rec. letter and I had a great time in her class. She can be kind of mean to certain people but those people kind of deserved it. Basically if you do your work, come to class and strike up a few conversations she will like you and you will get a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/05/2010<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It was a non major ANI 101. But she took it so hard on us. She was awfully rude and mean to many students. I believe she do not understand that we are non major students. The book was useless. Very challenging class. I spent more time doing her projects, then my Major classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2010<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't buy the book. you will never use it in or out class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2009<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Selina is so annoying! She is really helpful, but she is so rude! Some of the things she says make my jaw drop to the floor!AND the expensive textbook she makes you get is so useless! Don't buy it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/20/2009<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very helpful teacher, she will take time to sit down with you and do your projects in the media lab. The class is interesting and you watch a lot of cool videos. You work a lot in after effects so you get fimilar with it. What the person before me said is true haha, she does say rude things and your like uhhh, but she doesnt mean it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: ART113<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's from switzerland and kind of odd and often says rude things that i think she doesn't really mean or know the difference. otherwise, i did a lot of cool projects. she was a decent prof</div></div></div></body></html>
