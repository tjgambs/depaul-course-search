Very unclear about what she wants & in explaining the readings & is very condescending. Class is  extremely boring. I would avoid this professor at all cost. Yes, she incorporates her own life but it is just as boring and completely unrelated to the readings. She has no business teaching and should stick to running her organization.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: MPS500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Brennan did a great job integrating her own experience in the classwork.  She made good use of the synchronous sessions.  She was also very timely with grading and feedback.  There are quite a few papers with this course, but were manageable.  I also really enjoyed the textbook and found the case studies very helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2013<br>Class Name: MPS500<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Average professor, assignments were reasonable & clear overall.
