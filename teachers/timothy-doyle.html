Professor doesn't try to make it easy for you... if you're not mathematically inclined, try to take a different professor. For this class, you have to know trig, and know it well!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2015<br>Class Name: 131<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Doyle is not a good professor. He made trig hard for me when math is something that has always come naturally for me.  Very very unclear and confusing. He is not very willing to help outside of class and makes things much more complicated than they need to be. I would avoid him at all costs and try to get another professor if possible. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2015<br>Class Name: MAT131<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He helps and can be kind, but what is said about being pompous is true. He can use that time to show a cool way to understand memorize or do another example instead. Too much material for what we were tested on, and it makes testing harder because the concepts can get mixed up. If you take his class, ask what will be on exams and study that. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2015<br>Class Name: MAT131<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Doyle is one of the most unapproachable teachers  I have ever had. He rushes through lectures just to get through the information. He is not helpful when you ask questions. His quizzes and tests are weighted too heavily. The in class tests do not resemble the problems that you are required to complete the online portion of the class. DONT TAKE</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2014<br>Class Name: 151<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: C-</div><div id="right"><div>He's condescending, arrogant, annoying, his tests are difficult, and he doesn't care how well you do.  Avoid him. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2014<br>Class Name: MAT151<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Doyle does a pretty good job teaching calc. He really does know his stuff but for the people saying he's cocky and whatnot, I haven't seen anything like that. Yet. He does give a lot of examples and that's my style of learning. For people that need more explaining, make sure you ask or he won't tell. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2014<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Where do I begin? Condescending, rude, obnoxious, pompous, not helpful, arrogant, among many other things that make me ask why DePaul hires these adjunct professors that clearly have no technique. I attempted this class with a different professor and I passed with an A. Horrendously useless professor. I'm not the type to jump on for only bad stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2014<br>Class Name: MAT13Y<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really good teacher but can be very annoying. When answering questions he can come off as condescending and he does a lot of "showing off." A lot of "look how good I am at math." Not that difficult if you go to class and pay attention, and all the homework is online. However, the tests were much more difficult than homework/class problems.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2014<br>Class Name: MATH136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The people who rated this teacher well are off their rocks. This guy sucks. I can't even ask questions anymore because every time I do he makes an effort to make me look like an idiot. His class is making me sick. AVOID THIS GUY. I really don't even know why he teaches. He talks more about his 401k than math.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2014<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!! He is very smug and gives 2 Midterms and a Final which affect you grade severely. The problems on the midterms and finals are way harder than the homework. If you do take his class make him go over the practice midterms versus the problems on mymathlab because studying the problems on the homework is worthless</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2014<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awful teacher! Moves too fast and is obnoxious. Got the feeling that he looked down on everyone in the class and made me lose all motivation for this class. Take this class if you want to teach yourself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Doyle is extremely smart, but does not always know how to articulate that to students. He primarily teaches at UIC, but it seems that he has a grudge for DePaul students. I took this course over the summer so it was quick paced, but it took a lot of studying to do well in this course. Take this at your own risk.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Anyone who would say he is a great professor has not had a great professor before. He is very intelligent when it comes to math but not teaching. I would say that I am a solid B student in calculus and I found this class unreasonably hard. Do not take if you are less than great at math! Also, dont expect any help from him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Doyle really knows his stuff and is very enthusiastic about calculus. People expecting an easy A shouldn't take the course, because it is not an easy subject. It has nothing to do with the professor. Doyle gives plenty of example that appear on the exams. Great professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible professor.  He teaches solely with examples and just expects you to know what he's doing.  He barely explains any of the steps he's doing.  The class average for the midterm #1 was 65%, which he claimed to be normal.  How does a professor like him still have a job?</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: C+</div><div id="right"><div>Doyle went through many example through class, but he whizzed through them. Very smart, but he's a little too cocky. Online hw and quizes. Midterms are VERY hard! He doesn't really grade well or in students favors. His famous line is, "oh well!" I would NOT recommend him. Makes you feel stupid for asking questions. Hw problems are not like midterm.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/27/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Moved too fast, probably because of an infantile need to flaunt his expertise.  Made us write everything in fractional notation. Only used examples, never discussed even the simplest "why" we were doing something.  I got a perfect score in 135 immediately before Doyle and I had difficulty keeping up. Half the class dropped, another quarter failed</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2013<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice and smart guy, but the class was kind of awful. All we did was examples. No note taking or lessons, just examples. Lots of quizzes and a midterm. Do not recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2013<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's alright. He talks A LOT and does a ton of examples. He can answer anything really. Most the examples are questions that the class had on the homework. But when you go to ask a question he'll start answering before you're finished, which really annoyed me. The Friday session with the TA was pretty nice/useful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2013<br>Class Name: MATH136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this class! He made me love math and soooo helpful I soo recommend him as any math professor Definitely go to office hours if you want more one on one and you'll do fine :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2012<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Doyle is a math wiz. He is a good teacher, a little cocky, but explains things REALLY quickly. He also doesn't give step by step explanations, he teaches more with examples. The hw is not mandatory, there are quizzes pretty much every week, and the midterm and final are pretty tough. But if you pay attention and do the hw, you'll get by.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2012<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Doyle really knows his stuff. Approachable, friendly, and always willing to help. 7 quizzes a quarter with the best 5 counting for your grade. Gives out old practice midterms and finals which are super helpful and similar to actual midterm/ final. I recommend him as a teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2012<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor.  Knows math like the back of his hand, easily explains problems.  7 quizzes a quarter, challenging but ideas from the homework. Really enjoyed having him as a prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2012<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've had some bad math teachers before, Doyle isn't the absolute worst but he's at the border. He is a terrible math teacher, doesn't respond to E-mails, help students out. Class is extremely hard, he runs through examples, and criticizes students for asking "dumb" questions. For other classes, people say he's okay, but for 135, he's terrible</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2012<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Doyle is, in my opinion, one of the best math professors at depaul. He is extremely intelligent and lectures well. There are short quizzes a week that are very fair and homework is assigned but not collected. do your work and study your notes and you should have an A no problem.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2011<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, extrememly intellegent and helps students to do their best. Clearly explains examples and tests and quizzes look exactly like practice problems.  Short quizzes once a week, drops two lowest</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2011<br>Class Name: MATH095<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Willing to help you!!

He explains well and very smart so he know's what he is talking about. I really enjoyed his class.. I wish he taught my other math classes.

A very entertaining teacher and a really smart guy too.  As long as you're not horrible with math, you'll do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2011<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Doyle is amazing! He is a great teacher who thoroughly explains topics and takes the time toexplain why you are learning it. You use MyMathLab- which kind of sucks. If you pay attention and ask questions you will do very well!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2010<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Doyle is a wonderful teacher!  I took him for pre-calculus, and now that I am going into calc 3, I really wish I could have him for a teacher! He is very helpful, very understanding about late hw (which is online), and genuinely wants you to do well! He is the definition of what a teacher should be! He makes math as easy as any human can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2010<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Doyle is phenominal.  I am currently finishing up his course, and he is by far one of the most incredible math teachers I have ever had.  He explains everything crystal clear and will help you as much as you need him to.  The tests are exactly like the examples he shows.  If you have the opportunity I STRONGLY recommend you take Doyle!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2010<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you look at all these ratings, he's good for the lower math classes, now as far as Calculus and up, if you know your stuff take him, otherwise if you need help he's not really going to stoop down, he expects you to know the material and relys too much on you figuring it out on your own......Basically if you're a math wiz you're good</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2010<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful teacher! Very clear and concise! Understanding and willing to work with you. Gives good hints and relates the material to real world use. Excellent and I will be taking him for future math classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2010<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really easy, if you pay attention. Alot of homework, but mymathlab is really easy. quizes arent bad, 2 midterms werent bad either. You dont have to go to class, but if you do skip it'll be hard to catch up. math is always going to be boring, but if you just do your work you'll get a pretty good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2009<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best MATH TEACHERS I HAVE EVER HAD!!!! Im a freshman at DePaul and he was amazing!! Taught the material very well, everything was online!! He even opened up the homework section online a week before finals so we could get a better grade!! Overall Great Professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2009<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I like Tim Doyle. He is very clear about his expectations and explains topics really well. For this class, EVERYTHING was online...it's close to being in an online class, but you get great lectures, too, so this class is ideal- no ****. It's obviously going to be a little tedious- it's math. He will help you achieve a solid grasp on all topics.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2009<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's cool. comes off as hard but he's easy, and nice! teaches you how to do everything on ur calc and really wants u to do well. project was easy (made most of it up) the quizzes aren't that bad and he drops the lowest 2. know your formulas and you're golden! plus he cracks some good jokes from time to time! :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At first he seems like a really hard teacher and it seems the class is impossible but if you go to every class you will get a good grade.  He is really smart and moves fast so you cannot miss any classes.  All around a great teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2008<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy, VERY ARROGANT, assigns a lot of homework, quizzes and tests are a breeze though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2008<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm bad at math, he does his hardest to make it understandable. Give it your all, let him know if your having trouble and he'll help you out. I should have failed the class, but after speaking with Prof. Doyle I passed anyway.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/14/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Doyle is a good teacher the class was tough at times but he tries hard to help everyone out. I had him for a night class so we had quizzes every class but they were straight from the homework and easy if you did the exercises. If you pay attention and do all the exercises you should get a B no problem.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/23/2008<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A good family man, but doesn't curve even when it is desperately needed by most students.

But his quizes are easy if you study. He doesn't try to trick you by making really complicated problems. He explains pretty well, and is nice but seems like he wants to show off how good he is at math.</div></div></div></body></html>
