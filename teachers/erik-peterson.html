This is not the easiest class, as everything stated below is pretty accurate. Hard grader, not a ton of assignments, but if you do the work and read the assignment, you'll do fine. If you reach out to him, he is always helpful. Great professor, would take again if had the option.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2011<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy. Took him online for a class over break -- best decision. Did an awesome job of keeping us engaged even though no one stepped in a classroom. Unbelievably quick grader, clear, helpful, and funny. Take him if you want to take a class from home during the six weeks off.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2011<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Peterson is a great teacher. I took an online class and yet I felt like I was in class. He posted power points and videos to dig deeper into the material. Probably the hardest working professor I have had to date. Yes, he is a tough grader but if you follow his clear instructions you will do fine. If you have a problem, e-mail him.. he WILL hel</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2010<br>Class Name: JOUR515<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you do the work and work hard, you get good grades. If you complain and sleep in and procrastinate, you get back grades. Suck it up nerds.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2010<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a good guy and very nice but he tries to say he doesn't try to influence political views but it's very obvious he does- whether he's trying to or not. He is a hard grader and asks ridiculous questions on the exams. He does help out when you need it though. This class is supposed to be for communication but way harder than it should be</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2010<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a pretty good teacher. Cares a lot about the students and doing well in the class. HARD GRADER. If you don't follow every single direction for his papers, you'll get screwed.Overall, a good teacher but needs to chill on the grading</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2009<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First note: this is a communication class, so unless you are a communication major , don't take it. Erik Peterson is awesome.He desires to help students achieve success and goes out of his way to help. He isn't an easy grader, but news flash: life isn't an easy grader, if you can't hack it get out of college. Highly suggest for journalism classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/21/2009<br>Class Name: CMN110<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is not an easy professor to deal with. Writing assignments are to be in-depth, yet short- its like he does this just to get us, as there is no way to answer the questions while staying in the limits. Don't miss a class or he docks major points. Avoid taking him if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2009<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Minimal assignments, but harsh grader, be very careful with every assignment or you won't get anything higher than a C-. Don't take him if you're looking for open electives</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2009<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>attend every class.  do exactly as he says.  enjoys being a tough grader.  im not just saying this.  assignments are on the shorter end of the scale, so the grading is harsh. participate and add to the class and you will do well.</div></div></div></body></html>
