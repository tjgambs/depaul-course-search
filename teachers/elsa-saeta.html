Taking her right now at Dominican and yes she canceled class many times, but she had valid reasons. Don't hate for that. Life ain't easy. I would take her again in a heart beat. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really nice and trys to make class as interesting as possible.  No midterm or final just a paper.  She is pretty fair on grading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2012<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She canceled class so many times this quarter, 5 times! She's expecting so much from us, when she is not even there half of the time. I personally don't recommend her, and she grades super hard it seems to me almost impossible to please her. If you want a high expectation teacher who isnt there half of the time, this is your professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2010<br>Class Name: WMS212<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is growing up female in America, so naturally I thought we would talk about American culture, most of the readings are from women who are still living their country of origins culture.  DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS unless you are a feminist who will completely agree with the teacher on everything she says. Don't waste your time!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2009<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher cancels class ALL THE TIME which is nice and if she doesn't she lets you out early. Save some money and don't buy any of the books. Pretty easy class just do the assignments and try hard on the papers.  No tests and a final take home test.  EASY, all you have to do is show up!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2009<br>Class Name: LST202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Saeta is really a nice lady, but she is too dependent on student participation. Whole class was on readings. could make it the whole semester without reading one word. If nobody's interested in the topic, the awkward silence lasts until she decides to let the class out early. not recommended if you are actually interested in Latino Studies</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2009<br>Class Name: LSP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her class, the Latino Experience through the Arts and Media was horrible. She is a hard grader for papers. She brags that she is an &quot;English&quot; major so you can't B-S her papers. So get on her good side. Being active in the class won't help, I did the work and participated everyday but she gives me a B- and the guy that never talks gets an A!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2009<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was much harder than it was intended to be. Wrote two 4 page papers. One final 10 page paper with the option of doing a project that went along with a 6 page paper. Too hard of a class. Overwhelming homework. Too much reading that isn't discussed well enough in class. Overall, an average teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2007<br>Class Name: LST307<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved this professor. She was very nice and knew a lot about the topic. I thought she was a vey fair grader and she even altered the syllabus several times to fit the needs of the class. I would definitely recommend her!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2007<br>Class Name: LST307<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved this professor.

Positive aspects:  She had a vast knowledge of the subject matter.  Also, I got an A, so I'm cool with her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2005<br>Class Name: WMS200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very hard grader on the papers, which is most of your grade for the class. didn't help for shiznit when i asked for her advice, and ended up getting a lower grade after seeking her out! most boooring class EVER, only good thing is that she never noticed/cared when the class ditched during the half.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2005<br>Class Name: WMS200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she makes things plain and simple for you. she is very understanding and leniant about things.  keep up with the reading and do the few assignments and your all set for a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Elsa is a wondeful professor.  She really knows the material.  I didn't think she assigned a lot of reading, you just had to turn in a response to the reading every day. She can be lenient and will work with you if you come across any problems. Overall, she is a good professor, I strongly recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is so nice and cool.  A lot of papers though, and a lot of reading, but its fairly easy stuff.  The final is 10 pages though!!  That is in addition to 5 other papers your given practically in a lump.  If you talk to her though, she'll find a way to make things easier on you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2004<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>VERY generous with grading - I read maybe one of the 4 books we were assigned to read and I got an A- in the class.  Final paper is a lot of writing, but the material is interesting and she is really good about class discussions!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2004<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a nice lady. You would not believe from looking at her that she is latina (she has blonde hair and pale skin). None the less she is a good teacher, never didnt like her.  The class however was a hella lotta reading.  There seemed to be an overload of busy work to me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2004<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes a really nice lady.  The class was kind of dry though.  The books she chose for class were good.</div></div></div></body></html>
