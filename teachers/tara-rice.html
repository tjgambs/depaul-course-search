She bounces around a bit and the lectures can drag, but she is fair and you learn a good amount.  Two exams are entire grade and the the &quot;review&quot; she hands out prior to exam is very similar to the actual exam.  Definitely more &quot;hot&quot; than &quot;not&quot;.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2008<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Course consisted of two exams, midterm 40% and final 60% the review was similar to the tests. Not difficult if you go do all the review questions and she makes a big effort to make sure you understand what is taught.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2008<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall, the class was good.  2 tests (40/60) made up the entire grade and the she is pretty generous on the curve.  Don't have to hand in homework and the &quot;quizzes&quot; are not graded (more like a preview of the exams.)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2007<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was one of a few in the class that was not a Finance related major. Eventhough I always felt that the others understood much better, I came away having learned quite a lot. Tara was a very good instructor .. even teaching how to use Excel to assist with finance formulas.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2006<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree with the previous poster.  She's not the best prof at DePaul but definitely not the worst.  We had a take home mid-term and the final was multiple choice.  She isn't the best at explaining things, so if you haven't had finance before, you will get confused.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2006<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Rice is not difficult; she know what she's talking about.. but she has NO CLUE on how to explain.  she's not prepared for class, she gets confused while doing problems in front of class.. one word: A MESS!.  However, she's a fair grader...</div></div></div></body></html>
