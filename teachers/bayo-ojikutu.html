He really opens your eyes to a lot about the Black Migration to Chicago. He is a novelist himself and very passionate about the subject.

He gets you to think about things in a way you never would have thought of. You discuss things like the definition of race. Get to know him because if you do hell care about you as a person not just a student. He is hard, because he is smart but its not hard to get a good grade if you put a little effort.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2010<br>Class Name: ENG101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bayo is a great teacher, he really cares about what he teaches and knows his stuff...hes an author and also teaches at the university of chicago, descent amount of reading but as long as you read most of it and speak up in class he will take a liking to you, very good teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2009<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is very interesting. He is very intelligent and witty. He leaves any sort of political correctness behind and gets to the true root of why things happen. He is always there to help personally and professionally and takes deep interest in his students. I would take another class from him anytime.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2009<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was decent. Four books for this class which you hardly use..I'd recommend borrowing them for the library which will save you about $100. He tends to mumble and his handwriting is horrible.  He's kinda boring and uses too many big words..like he can't say what he wants simply and wants to show off his vocabulary.  Overall I'd give the class a C</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2009<br>Class Name: ENG291<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Those who rate him poorly have ridiculously high standards for people. He's great! He's smart, funny, helpful, knowledgeable. Granted, he mumbles a lot but it's a kind of enlightened Einsteinian sort of scattered-brained mumble. And, yeah, he isn't particularly organized, but, in exchange, there's lenience on his part. I'd recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2009<br>Class Name: ENG307<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was not completely organized, so it was a little frustrating never really knowing details about assignments. The actual class was a good class to take. Very useful workshops. The most helpful part of this class were the peer workshops.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2008<br>Class Name: WRD203<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His writing is attrocious and he often requires you to write down random thoughts he has, but no one can even come close to how much he knows about the subject. He is quite funny, and very approachable. Only lectures, and they are quite boring, but very informative.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2008<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He may have an impressive vocablary, but everything he says is repetitive, and his lectures are unhelpful. We only has class once a week,  but he often did not show up, and he seemed to see no problem with this. He assigned papers only 2 days before the day they were due, one of which was the Sunday after Halloween. I am not a fan.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2008<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome class, amazing teacher.

He mumbles threw things and goes off on tangents.  Does not help students when they need it.  Really difficult to deal with.

He will make you think & question the way you view yourself and the world around you. Plus, he is a novelist. His assignments were not the easiest but I greatly enjoyed them & learned a lot...

Yes he tends to ramble on on his lectures..but he is very intelligent. very willing to give feedback for papers.

This was a workshop class and people were giving more feedback than the class time permitted and Ojikutu did not stop them. The class went on overtime into spring break. The professor does mumble and his instructions are unclear and not directed at the students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2007<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was so unorganized and was 2 weeks late getting my rough draft back to me.  It should have taken him one night to do it... tthats how it was with everyone else's paper!  Also we learned maybe 3 concepts the first week of classes and after that we did absolutely nothing.

He speaks to the chalkboard and mumbles.  His assignments are unclear.  He cancelled class and graded papers during class time.  He makes waste of class time like its his job.

DO NOT TAKE...WASTE OF YOUR MONEY!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2006<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great person overall,  good class overall but did not learn very much.

Realy deep conversations. He let us know that the only thing that matters is the assignments (we only had 4 for the whole semester) it didn't feel like you had to do the readings as long as you where able to give civilized discouse.

Assignments were unclear, his lectures had absolutely nothing to do with English and he handed back 2 of the almost 15 assignments we had in class.  If you are looking for an easy class, take him.

Class was mostly discussion, with him stopping every once in a while to make sure we stayed somewhat on topic.  He never shut anyone down in class simply for espousing an opposing viewpoint.

Overall, great teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's awesome and completely down to earth. He makes sure you develop SOME opinion on everything, which is good. Papers are not bad at all. Class discussions are often and it is to your utmost advantage to participate OFTEN.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2004<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's an awesome teacher. Very funny and kept the class interesting. Papers but no tests or final.

A lot of his discussions are very deep but he involves everyone of his students to make class fun.  All the readings are easy but you have to make sure you pay attention to them if you plan on geting a good grade on the papers.  Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely tough grader, but if you enjoy discussions about society take this class. He wants everyone involved, just make sure you can keep up in this class and you'll sneak out with a B at least</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As a teacher he was ok. He became very disorganized at the end with the presentations. We had to use extra time in class to finish the presentations and not only that he made me go last when it wasn't my fault he didn't organize the timing. But he is cool</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2004<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>grr</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2004<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing teacher.  He is the best teacher I have had at DePaul.  It is not a slacker course but if you get a chance take one of his classes.  One can learn a lot from Bayo but don't let is large vocabulary intimidate you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/22/2004<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He sinteresting funny and an overall nice guy. he keeps the class fun and is leniant with homework. good teacher and interesting classes</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2004<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a great teacher.
