She is extremely helpful and knowledgable. I've never felt that a professor cared more about my grade. The assignments build on each other, making the research paper is not as hard as it could have been. All in all, Van Kirk made WRD 104 a good experience.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>2nd time taking this class and Professor VK is awesome! She is very understanding and will always give you the benefit of the doubt. Her assignments are pretty easy compared to my first WRD 104 class. She tries to get you to know others in the class which I think is a great idea, especially for freshmen. Take her if you can!</div></div></div></body></html>
