So far he is my favorite prof @ DePaul. Cool guy willing to help. Makes you attend to mandatory office meetings which is great because they count towards your grade and it also forces you to go in and talk about your papers which helps with your overall grade on them. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2011<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Phelps has certain expectations for his students in terms of overall writing ability, but he's more then willing to meet outside of class for help. I met with him on several occasions to discuss my papers. Honestly, take his class if you'd like to become a more college ready academic writer.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2011<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ridiculous quizzes that have nothing to do with the reading and worth most of your grade. Boring lectures, picks favorites. Unoriginal ideas. Passive aggressive, disrespectful, rigid, useless class. Don't let the fact that it's literature and film fool you. SLOW e-mailer. Absolutely a waste of time. Hard, slow grader. Unavailable outside of class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2010<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very understanding professor. Realized what the course objectives were and stuck to them. Taught what needed to be taught. He keeps class interesting with his witty comments every now and then.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2009<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's a great class and he picks out interesting material to read. He likes it if you talk...and if you are a girl. He can be a real ass and extremely judgmental. If you make a stupid comment he lets you know it. But he is helpful and wants you to further in your writing. Take the class, but be prepared.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/31/2008<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>James Phelps is a faux-intellectual who thinks that he's just too damn hip to be square. Nice soul-patch buddy, real becoming on a grown man. My experience with him has been mainly in an advising capacity and let me assure you that while he is &quot;workable&quot; he can be very condescending and judgemental. Eager to get the freshman girls to like him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/22/2008<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Does a great job in every facet of teaching. great guy as well, knows everyone and makes jokes. My first ever college class and will probably be my favorite of my college career. Even the 8:30 class isnt terrible. I hope he stays around. for your sake.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At first he comes off as an ass, but he'll grow on you. Expect a good grade if you write well and show up to class. Good teacher to start my college experience with.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>good teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>hes sooo cute!!! very straightforward with what he wants done...get everything in to him on time and as long as you put forth effort...youll get a good grade! keep up on all the readings...there arent a lot...so theres really no excuse not to ...proofread all essays for grammar!!! he takes off a lot of points for stupid mistakes so always proofread</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2006<br>Class Name: ENG<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>VERY FUNNY IF YOU PUT IN THE EFFORT AND TIME YOU WILL GET AN A IN HIS CLASS.

He is very cool. Very laid back, but expects the best in order for him to return it in his teaching. Great topics to write on, but expects you to put in the effort to do well. Hope he sticks around, because he'll become very popular w/the students and on this website.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.  He tries to help you whenever you need help.  The papers are easy, he looks through the 1st draft, then you rewrite it and turn it in for a grade.  Easy going teacher, its a good class, take it</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BEST TEACHER EVER!!

Very open to everyone's ideas, hes not one of those English teachers that think his interpretation is the only correct interpretation.
