I kept waiting to get completely lost, but it never happened. Dr. Halpert went out of her way to make sure we understood the material, and she was very sweet. Go to class every day though, she doesn't post the powerpoints.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2015<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Halpert is adorable, hilarious, and my ideal teacher. She is always available for extra Help. Offers TONS of extra credit. Explains really well. Doesn't require attendance. And will bake you cookies. 1010 would take this class again. I took stats with her and I hate stats but loved her class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2015<br>Class Name: PSY340<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Halpert is a good teacher overall, and is very eager to help anyone who needs it. The only thing to watch out for is she can get a little snippy if you ask her redundant questions, but otherwise is usually more than happy to accommodate. Make sure you get a copy of the textbook because the tests are open bookopen note.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2014<br>Class Name: PSY340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Please do your best to avoid her. She is very rude and intimidating. She will answer each question with hostility and will make you hate whatever class you take with her. Save your time and money and avoid this prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2013<br>Class Name: PSY340<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have no idea where the good ratings are coming from for this professor. Grade is 1/3 homework, 1/3 midterm, 1/3 final. Homework is relatively easy and I did well, however the exams have very little to do with actually understanding statistics and instead minute details she includes in her PowerPoint slides. Would not recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2012<br>Class Name: PSY381<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class average on our first exam was 77%. No study guide. Expects you to read everything. I am not sure where all the nice comments are coming from, but she is not as easy as they say here. She may be good for stats but she didn't know how to teach PSY 381. Overall nice but strict teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2012<br>Class Name: PSY381<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very boring class. Strict on attendance! Go to every class. Don't come late or make noise while leaving. Read the book! Her lectures are easy to zone out from but the amount of info you get from just being there should be enough. Easy assignments just turn them in on time! But the tests were hard - lots of information. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2010<br>Class Name: PSY340<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a ridiculously easy class.  All tests are open book and open note.  The downside is that the professor sometimes treated us like high school students and can sometimes be condescending. If you want a GPA booster, definitely take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2010<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very nice professor, easy to understand, easy A if you do your homework.

Take her hands down for an easy A. If you don't get something GO TO HER OFFICE HOURS, she'll help you out 100% no doubt. Fair grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2009<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an I/O psychologist, and very enthusiastic about Stats. Everyone says stats is hard, she makes it so easy. Open note/open book for all three tests. Homeworks are easy. She is a good teacher. No Hesitations, take her.Her grading is above and beyond fair. She wants you to succeed, and enjoy stats as much as she does. :)yayaya</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2008<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's a great teacher! she makes the material so easy to understand. her notes are so simple! all you have to do is come to class to get the notes and you will pass with flying colors! she knows how to teach stats extremely well! take her, go to class, and you will get an A!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2006<br>Class Name: PSY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she always want to help you ... she wont hurt you and shes very nice... take her for sure</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2006<br>Class Name: STATS1<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a great teacher.

I was skeptical about what everyone else was saying, but low and behold they were right.  She explains EVERYTHING, if you go to class and take notes, you'll be fine on the tests. If you have a good grasp on stats and math she'll probably be boring to you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2005<br>Class Name: STATS<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very smart lady!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2005<br>Class Name: PSY340<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you're gonna take stats do it with Dr. Halpert.
