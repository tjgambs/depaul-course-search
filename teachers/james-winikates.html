Knowledgeable and interesting. We have written homewhork every class, mid/final, group presentation, individual project, and some cases. Sounds like a lot, but really not that bad. His classes are interesting, though midterm was kind of tough. I would definitely recommend him especially if you are aiming for auditing position</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2009<br>Class Name: ACC374<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing professor! A very nice person and such a knowledgable professional! I wish I had a chance to take more classes with him (though he doesn' teach any other if I'm not wrong). Together with McCarthy, he is absolutaly the best ACC teacher at DePaul. Highly recommended, would definitely take again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2009<br>Class Name: ACC620<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing professor,a very nice person.
