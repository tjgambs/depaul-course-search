He is amazing. Already planning on taking other courses with him. Great real-life PR experience, which you don't think matters in a professor but it makes his lectures bearable. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2015<br>Class Name: PRAD337<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is tough. It isn't the material that's hard, its the time. You hardly get time in class to work with your group, but you NEED a lot of time to work on the project. It gets tough to coordinate schedules with 6 group members. Don's classes have great clients to work on, but he might not be the best teacher for this class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2015<br>Class Name: PRAD256<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hands down the best PRAD professor at DePaul. Has tons of industry experience, and lectures are entertaining and informative. A few quizzes and writing assignments, but overall the class is easy and a lot of fun!

He makes class fun, interesting and just a good time all around. I suggest anyone take Don for a class or you may be missing out on one of the greatest teachers out there. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2014<br>Class Name: PRAD256<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don Ingle is by far the best professor I've had at DePaul!

He makes it fun and enjoyable. Took him at NIU, one of the best decisions as an undergrad. Come to class, pay attention to the numerous examples, and I mean numerous, and you will be just fine. Very hard to get anything lower than a B if you actually do the work</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2014<br>Class Name: PRAD337<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Easily one of the best instructors, as well as class,I've taken at DePaul.Don is not only one of the most insightful professors I've had,but also the most caring and passionate-just an overall nice guy.The entirety of the class you work on real-world PR campaign,pretty cool!Take this class with Don,you will be doing yourself a disservice otherwise.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2014<br>Class Name: PRAD337<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I have taken 3 classes with Don, and if you do not take him at least once, you are doing yourself a disservice. He is my favorite professor by far at DePaul. He requires a lot of work and can be tough, but you will learn more than you ever imagined. A good effort with him will go a long way. PR MAJORS MUST TAKE HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2013<br>Class Name: PRAD256<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took multiple PR classes with him. He is seriously one of the best professors I have ever had. Awesome guy, has worked in the industry for years. Classes are always interesting. Sad that I'm graduating and won't be in his classes anymore. Highly recommend taking him. Gives excellent feedback that you will actually use in the field.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2013<br>Class Name: PRAD256<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Remarkable professor. One of the toughest graders I have ever had but he whips your writing into shape. The work that we did in class is extremely relevant to the outside world and will help you land any internship or job. I promise.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2013<br>Class Name: PRAD256<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOME professor. The class is a lot of writing (I mean... it is a writing course after all), but extremely useful. Just make sure to follow the homework guidelines. I feel like half the class didn't follow the instructions (which are really clear) and got horrible grades. Awesome professor, just do the work, it's not hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2013<br>Class Name: PRAD256<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very hard grader BUT if you try hard you should be just find.  It is a fun class and he is a great guy that really cares about the subject.  Take him if you have the change and you won't regret it! No exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2013<br>Class Name: 2561<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Ingle is hands down the best teacher I have had. His classes are fun and he really cares about his students. If you have to take Writing for Public Relations and Advertising, take his class.

Hands down best professor. Took his PR Intro class just because as a direct result of his class decided to major in it. Let's you be creative and gives amazing feedback. He really wants students to do well. Amazing man.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD256<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>legend. Honestly one of the best professors I've ever had. Funny, erudite, and unbelievably engaging; if you're a PRAD major, you have absolutely no excuse to not take him. He can be challenging when it comes to grading work, but as long as you follow his advice your grades will improve (and in large part, that's because your writing will improve).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don is honestly one of the best professors I've ever had. He's pretty strict on attendance but he has so much experience it's really worth going to class for. The class really gets your feet wet in PR and Don really knows his stuff. He's really friendly too, just a tough grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a great teacher but an extremely hard grader. I've always done exceptionally well with papers and work really hard on them but he would always find something wrong with it. I would recommend him since he makes everything interesting but really, do not slack off at all on the papers!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD256<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredible teacher who brings real world expierence and passion to each class. Takes his time to get to know each and every student. Is very interested in making each student a better writer and succeeds in doing so. Has a great personalitly and makes you feel like you've known him for years. My favorite professor at DePaul hands down. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Favorite professor that I've ever had. Passionate about everything that he teaches & is extremely knowledgable about PR having worked in the industry prior to teaching it.

He is an absolute inspiration and genuinely cares about each of his students. I have never met someone with more passion for his subject. I highly recommend him for ANY class that he may teach.  I hope DePaul recognizes what an asset they have. I would DEFINITELY take him again if I could, again and again!</div></div></div></body></html>
