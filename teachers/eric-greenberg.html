His innate ability to reach out to students and draw them in is something that can not be taught.He is helpful when a student needs help. He flies around the room and makes every lecture enjoyable to attend. He is intellegent, humorous and really nice professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2008<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i love this guy. granted, you kinda have to teach yourself the material for the tests. he mostly spends time applying the concepts to the real world. plus, if you need any help, he will clarify anything you want. class flies by. he really cares about his students. all of the tests Qs come right from his notes and chpt problems.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2008<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Greenberg is a good guy. His teaching style is a bit off the wall but not impossible to understand. He actually gives you information you will use later in life rather than theory like other professors. He's really hard on cheating so DON'T cheat. Easy as that.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2008<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His teaching style is indeed controversial. I do not approve it nor reccomend enduring it. Take someone else and be careful, I heard he's also teaching this same course over the summer; avoid at all costs.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/13/2008<br>Class Name: ACCT102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is pretty crazy and teaches us stuff that we need in the real world. He is pretty hard though. His homework is hard and he does not explain anything. he wastes most of class ranting about people he does not like. If I keep going this will be deleted but I recommend someone else, but if you are independent and can teach yourself go for it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2008<br>Class Name: ACC360<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At first he comes off as mean and intimidating, but he's actually a really nice guy. He makes his lectures entertaining as much as he can (which I imagine is hard to do since tax is not exactly the most exciting thing in the world).His notes are your bible. If you understand the problems in the book and the notes, you're more than fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2008<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor, excellent class.  Everything you learn is useful and interesting.  for someone who find accounting painful, this course was actually enjoyable.  the course pack offered is a useful guide to make anyone's life easier.

Hold on 2 ur seats! No lattes needed in this class. His approach is unique, insightful, immediately applicable, & colorful 2 say the least.

His course pack is awesome..if you study that you'll do fine.  I reccomend going to class and do the homework bc its easy to fall behind.

I just took him for ACC102 from 6-9pm 2 nights a week. Usually I would fall asleep in a 3 hour class at night, but he constantly throws in jokes. He does care about his students and will help you. He is young, energetic, and has a lot of experience in the field.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/13/2007<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>In my class, less than half the students show up for class! And you wonder why people say he's hard. I would've had a C or B on the test, but his huge extra credit and curve brought me to an A :D I highly recommend him! I regret not taking him for 101. Also he relates everything to trading/investing so he gives you real world experience$$$</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2007<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enrolled in his class to see what all of the hype was about.I heard so many great things about him,in reality he is not all that.He's really rude and can be a PITA.I did well in the class, I simply dislike the fact that he has poor teaching ethics.I'd go with Pritchard or Flynn,if you want to learn AND get a ass good grade in ACC. He's a joke.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2007<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is great! I'll admit he is a little crazy at times, but everything is off of his notes and his examples.

He's the best prof for it. Relates everything to the real world & stock mkt and makes it so much easier to understand. You walk away with how to invest and make $$.

Don't listen to the person below. He's crystal clear & his notes are awesome! All u have to do is know them & do the HW. Eveything on his exams are off those.I have a 2.8 GPA & got an A in his class.

His exams are all CPA questions.  HW is 10% of grade, the rest is exams.  He is a great prof, and tells you the truth all the time.  He gives tons of useful info on a variety of topics.  Nice curve too!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is awesome! His lectures are interesting, and he doesn't take it bad if you don't laugh about his lame jokes. He is extremely fair when it comes to grading, but if you are an accounting major then you definitely have to put in the extra effort and work through the book parallel to attending the class. I look forward to see him in ACC 360.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Accounting sucks, but he made it tolerable. Lots of lame jokes, but he is very detailed. Goes over the assignments very thoroughly and is available outside of class as much as is needed. Quantity of work wasn't too bad, and he curves to where at least half the class gets an A or a B. Didn't take attendance either. I'd definitely recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was my first day today, and this has been the first teacher at DePaul so far that has kept my attention the whole class.
