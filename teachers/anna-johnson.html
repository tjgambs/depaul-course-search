There is no textbook (she scans all chapters onto D2L. The reading is really short and interesting. Anna's really nice. Midterm is 2 essays,about 2 pages double-spaced. Final is a 6 page paper. Weekly writing responses also (1 page single spaced). I'd recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2013<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a very nice professor but the class and the topics are so boring! Most students had a very hard time staying awake. She also revolves her lectures around conversations with the same one or two students all quarter.</div></div></div></body></html>
