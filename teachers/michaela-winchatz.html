I guess this class is not for those students who want easy A because there are quiz almost in every class, 2 exams including essay questions and she expects students to actively participate in discussion and to attend every class. But, there are many things you can learn from her and it's worth to take the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/31/2014<br>Class Name: INTC361<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although the class is a little tough, Prof. Winchatz is a really great teacher. Two papers, and two very detailed tests. Those tests are the two most information heavy I've taken, but the class is worth it. She is absolutely hilarious, but she will make you participate. I spoke every class and didn't get 100% on participation. Still, take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2014<br>Class Name: 101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: C</div><div id="right"><div>A very smart woman who sets high standards for her students, but don't be intimidated because she is fair. Awesome personality, gives some cool lectures and all assignments are fair. READ. Trust me. READ. You wont regret it. Take her if you don't mind participating. I had a great experience with her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2014<br>Class Name: INTC333<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Winchatz is the best professor I have ever had. She will completely change how you think about speaking. She is a gifted professor who really cares about her students. HIGHLY recommend taking her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2014<br>Class Name: INTC30<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B-</div><div id="right"><div>I never thought I would ever make a comment on this website, until I took this professor. Professor Winchatz is probably a really nice person out of class, but the DAILY quizes on readings that will never pertain to ANY real life discussion on racism threw me overboard. I'll stop before I say anything mean. Take her at your own risk.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2013<br>Class Name: CMN361<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am bewildered by all the positive reviews of this terrible teacher. Winchatz is a one-trick pony. She seems to stay about a chapter ahead of the students, and when pressed for more information in this advanced class, just blew me off. She clearly favors male students, which infuriates women in the class. Two papers, two big tests. Ho-hum. AVOID.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2013<br>Class Name: INTC361<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TAKE HER! Her class will change your perspective and even your life. Study hard for tests, do the readings carefully, attend class and participate. Discussions are interesting. If you do your work, you will take away a lot from your experience with in her class. I would take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2011<br>Class Name: CMNS361<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Dr. Winchatz for Gender & Communication, and absolutely LOVED the class.  She does have very high standards and the tests are detailed, but everything in the syllabus is extremely clear and organized.  Her passion for teaching and for the subject material is fantastic-- I highly recommend her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2011<br>Class Name: CMNS331<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was enjoyable & the teacher is pretty great, but just be warned that the 2 projects in her class are A LOT of work- busy & tedious work that cannot be BS'd/done quickly, which would be fine if she was a better final grader. Got straight A's on my assignments & she gave me a B+ in the class.  I think it's a pretty BS move if you ask me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2010<br>Class Name: CMNS361<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a great professor, but her classes are a lot of work.  She tells you exactly what she expects of you, so you are guaranteed an A/B if you follow her guidelines/syllabus.  Attendance and reading are mandatory.  Her exams cover a TON material, but she tells you in detail what to study. I recommend her if you're willing to put in the work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2010<br>Class Name: CMNS361<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice Professor. Work load isn't bad. Two paper, midterm, final. Keep up with the reading and participate in class= A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2009<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great professor! gives relatable examples and tells interesting stories in class. case study was short and to the point which was good. final had 60 something multiple choice and was everything she taught in class. just study the final review guide she gives you, read & you'll do fine. always willing to help!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/20/2008<br>Class Name: CMN300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Perhaps a different take as I am an older student. Ed $ are for quality classes, not easy grades for me. True master of her subject area, and presents very well. Either you do  your work, or get the grade you deserve. Really, I needed help, and she was available, encouraging, great communicator when she saw I was putting the effort in.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2008<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice lady, always entertaining. Class dragged from time to time. Heavy note taking, for 90 mins every class. Pretty hard grader on papers and the midterm was rough. class avg was a C. reviews are somewhat vague covering 10 chaps.. heavy load for one test. Nice teacher, helpful but you need to work to get the grade. Not an easy A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2008<br>Class Name: GENCOMM<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she was definitely a cool professor.  she is funny and makes classes interesting by doing different things every class (ie: movie, group work, lecture, etc). the only thing to beware of are her exams, which may seem easy because she hands out the most in-depth study you will probably ever see, but don't let it fool you..the tests can be tricky!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2007<br>Class Name: CMN361<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>PROS: Wonderful woman. Opinionated, in a good way. Values people and their experiences. Funny, too. Very interesting material. CONS: Notes can get tedious, but helps the material sink in. Q's on Midterm and Final have tricky wording and cover a LOT of material. Might not do as well as you thought. Study! *Overall worthwhile, Recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2007<br>Class Name: CMN308<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVED HER. great teacher and great teaching style. she challenges you. take her, she rocks</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2007<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've had Dr. Winchatz 3 times now, and all I can say is she's AWESOME.  Her classes can be tough, but she's incredibly fair, kind, and really tries to help you in any way she can.  Everyone got into discussions -- and she's cool with whatever anyone thinks as long as you participate. Exam reviews and feedback are detailed.  Take her if you can!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2006<br>Class Name: CMN203<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do exactly as you are told, don't miss a class, don't be late, and make a special effort to say something incredibly liberal (borderline communist, if at all possible).  She's fair, but get a solid A or solid B, because she can't count.  If you think you have a B-, its a C+.  She literally can't count.  Night classes suck, don't take her at night.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2006<br>Class Name: CMN361<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gender And Communication, good class. She is a good teacher.. but don't take her if you don't like to go to class or participate. These are very important to her and impact your grade. Otherwise, good teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2005<br>Class Name: ENG361<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would reccomend Dr. Wichatz to anyone. She is, by far, one of the best professors I have had. Her classes are challenging and intellectually stimulating. She most definitely is not arrogant, nor self absorbed. She runs the classroom very well, there are no hidden tricks to getting good grades with her. She is very clear in what she expects. GREAT</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/12/2005<br>Class Name: CMN<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take her! She hates anyone who doesn't agree with her beliefs.  Although I ended up getting a decent grade in the class she always started arguments with me in class.  Very hard to like, and picks favorites on the first day.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2005<br>Class Name: CMN203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class, great topics, tests are a little hard I think.

The class is very interresting and Dr. Winchatz is a great prof. She is the sweetest woman and makes her class interresting. Great Class. Would recommend it, sometimes heavy reading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2005<br>Class Name: COMM<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/25/2004<br>Class Name: ANT201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She did as well as she could, but the class was thrown on her with little prep time.  Very helpful if needed, you just have to let her know you're having trouble.  Classes were fine to sit through, she didn't spend the entire time lecturing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2004<br>Class Name: CMN203<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>makes great discussions happen in class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2004<br>Class Name: CMN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Winchatz is a great teacher!
