He is extrememly intelligent yet has no idea on how to teach. He is always takling over the heads of the class. I would have learned more if Hellen Keller taught the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2005<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow, J. T. is not good.  He's a very nice man... very nice, but he teaches like Garfunkel sings; like garbage.  Do not take him.  Nothing good will come out of this class.  If he is still around, leave.  Econ majors, I am sorry for this man.  EXTREMELY unclear in everything.  Don't bother studying anything but his essays.  Good luck, guys/gals!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think I recall him saying that this was his final class before moving back into the private sector.  Regardless, that's exactly how he taught the class.  Several classmates approached DePaul about getting our money back(unsuccessful).  He was disinterested and extremely boring.  He's a brilliant economist but not well suited to teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2005<br>Class Name: ECON315<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>good teacher, read the book, ask question and show up and you will be fine. take time to work on project. just read the book and you should get a good grade</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2005<br>Class Name: ECON315<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>oh my GOD, do not take this man. he's too smart to teach. he lectures on and on as if he's lecturing the federal reserve commity.he will put u to sleep. midterm and final are immposible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2005<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Save your money and don't take him. The only positive from this proferssor is that he is very nice, but so dumb as to realize that he is boring and that he goes off into other topics without keeping focus. His midterm and final are difficult best advice ditch class, read the book, and study hard!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2005<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid this guy at all costs!!!  If you do have to take him however, make sure u read the book, cause u definitely wont learn anything in his class.  The tests are hard, so study for them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2005<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His midterm and final were hard. The homework comes from the lectures not the book most of the time. My advice if you have to take him, is get the optional workbook and go through the multiple choice questions, alot of them were on the test. Nice guy, though</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2005<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a bad guy, just very boring, and he tends to get lost in what he is saying sometimes.  But he does give you the essay questions that are going to be on the exam before the exam.  You are not going to go through all the chapters on the syllabus, you best bet is to actually read the book</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2005<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>pretty crappy teacher...but he seems like a nice fellow. His lectures are like listening to ben stein talk... boring.. super boring.  one time he accidentelly put the answers to the midterm on the test... i copied all the answers and got an A on the test..haha... but i still got a B- in his class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/13/2005<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is not AS bad as everyone says.He doesnt test anything he doesnt cover. 'Cause he tends to go off and talk about the price of a barrel of oil, however, he gets behind.If Eco's not ur thing, prepare to read the book 3 times.  But he will squeeze 10 chts into a final.  If u ask, he helps a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2004<br>Class Name: ECON315<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>terrible class.  spent his time getting himself confused in his own lectures.  gave hypothetical examples that even he couldnt follow.  otherwise he is a nice guy, knowledgable in his field, but just a bad teacher.  easily embarrassed</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2004<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i'm not even done with this class, but i already have things to complain about...he throws away homework instead of giving it back to the class, and the genius stapled the answer key to the midterm exam,which means we have to take ANOTHER ONE! take my advice, do not take this teacher, it's painful!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/09/2004<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He worked at the St. Louis Fed Res Bank so he knows finance in and out but can NOT teach it.  Soft spoken and easily embarassed when questioned.  Half the class would leave before the class was over.  Don't bother going, he doesn't know names anyway.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2004<br>Class Name: ECON315<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very Boring. Very unclear in his lectures. Does not stress important parts of lecture. Does not hand back homework homework. Very un-organized.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2004<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are willing to put forth an effort, the class is very interesting. His teachings were tilted towards supply-side economics, which is the only negative. Good class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2003<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take him unless you want to work your butt off but still get a C-.

The time is better used this way.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2003<br>Class Name: ECON315<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he should take his southern accent and go back to georgia for all im concerned.
