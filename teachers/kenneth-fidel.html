I retained more Soc. material from HS which was the only reason I passed here. His lectures do not coincide with sociology material, rather stories about his life that are not interesting whatsoever. 65% of the class was given a C for no clear reason. Absolutely pathetic. Stay away</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2014<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thoroughly enjoyed this class.  I am aware not everyone is a fan of when teachers incorporate their personal experiences into the lectures and make you read on your own, but I didn't even buy the book and still passed easily.  Easy paper grader and a really knowledgeable guy.  Tests are a bit tricky though but he gives you definitions in class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2014<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a really cute old man and I want to like him, but the class made that difficult. He rambles on, complaining about the "upper class", telling pointless stories about his Turkish wife and seems to forget where he is from time to time. Go to class, because the tests are vague, but the class is REALLY self-taught. Would not take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2013<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't recommend. If you can take someone else, do it. He doesn't use the book often, essay topics are vague, randomly changed our final from MC to in class essays. I missed one test, got a make up, was told it wasn't going to be full credit AFTER he graded it. Repeats boring stories and I got more from the book than attending class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2013<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE HIM. All he does is tell his life story and talk about the public school system and Turkey. If you ask a question or say something that he views as incorrect he will belittle you and make you feel dumb. His quizzes are worded poorly and his paper topics are vague. DO NOT RECOMMEND</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He talks about his life way too much and when he does decide to try and teach, we don't cover much. He spends 50 minutes on a paragraph in the text and leaves the rest for you to read on your own. This class is seriously torture for any student with half a brain.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2013<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very lazy teacher always talks about how turkey is better then america even thought he's not even turkish.

Uses single generic methods to lecture. Class is boring offers students little motivation to learn unless you're super interested in the subject. Paper topics are vague; sometimes have little relevance to the course. Self-taught class no point in attendance. Blah</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2013<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>STAY AWAY, please. I was hoping for this class to be  a basic intro to sociology, but instead the class got an intro to his life...AND IT NEVER ENDED! To this day (7 weeks in) he talks about the same stories over and over. Credit is lost if you skip class, but even when you're there it is a complete waste of time. STAY AWAY! Horrible teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2013<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>worst professor I've had at DePaul.

He'll expect the same from his students like common courtesy, responsibility, and decency. However, he comes from a humble background with many experiences, so he definitely wants to teach his students. He's hard to follow a first, but take notes in class and read the articles. Tests EASY</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>boring and rude ! i cant wait to be done with him...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2011<br>Class Name: SOC245<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's funny cause there has been multiple posts about him removed from the site, he is the worst teacher I have had. Constantly making fun of students, and wont hesitate to fail you.  Gave me a 5/30 on a midterm when everything i wrote was word for word off his note sheet. He is and should never be a teacher, DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASSES.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2011<br>Class Name: SOC295<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Fidel is really passionate about what he is teaching. Here is his deal...#1 go to class and take notes. If you take notes you dont have to read or buy the book. #2 he will give you a study guide the class period before your midterm/final. The study guide will be a condensed version of your notes. He will then choose 3 questions for tests.

However, if nobody participates, then he will just keep lecturing on the topic.  Sure, his lectures are peppered with personal experiences, but he tries hard to make them relevant.

Half of every class is wasted on his stories (which really aren't very good). He just talks the whole time.
