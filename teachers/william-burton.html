Burton is a great teacher who really tries to get his point across. take his other classes though, they're much easier.  despite his age, he's kinda cute too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2005<br>Class Name: REL190<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know how people grade a class and say it is an easy A when the freakin class isn't done!!.  I felt bad for the professor and all of us taking this confusing, disorganized class. He lectures well and really does try but it isn't good enough when this class is a requirement and your grade is based on it. Loved him, hated the class.  Avoid!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2005<br>Class Name: REL190<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>REL 190 is the worst class ever!  I've never had to write that many papers. If I would know, I would have avoid this stupid class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2005<br>Class Name: REL190<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Never take REL 190. The books are extremely confusing but prof. Burton still pushes it. You have to write one 2.5 page paper for every monday, midterm essay, and 10-12 page final paper. The grading is biased, the class is boring and confusing, no clear schedule. That's the worst class ever!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: REL233<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>spend 15 minutes or less to prepare quizzes, exams and still get an A. no homework, no project easiest class.  highly recommended</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2005<br>Class Name: REL233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TAKE HIS CLASS!  You will have a quiz every class period, but he basically gives you an outline of what to study beforehand.  The midterm/final are pretty long (150-300 questions), but the questions are based on the quizzes you've already taken.  Basically, take his class for an easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2005<br>Class Name: CTH213<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fr. Burton is the best professor I have ever had. Very helpful, smart, and fair. He is so approachable, and the material was fun and easy. This is the easiest A, if you get anything lower, you're just lazy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2005<br>Class Name: REL235<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very knowledgable,and can answer almost any question.  as long as you want to learn, you will</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2005<br>Class Name: CTH216<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Was dreading taking this class but loved it! He made it extremely interesting and a fun class to attend. It ended up being one of my favorite classes.  He is brilliant when it comes to his subject and easily relates to the students.  Very funny personality, I would have never thought he is a priest!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2005<br>Class Name: REL235<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Burton is really funny and incredibly nice. Knows what he is talking about and REALLY passionate about teaching. Quiz everyday but gives you the Q&A, quizzes are the midterm and final verbatim, SOOOO easy.

Burton is an awesome professor!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2005<br>Class Name: REL202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great professor.

Bill is awesome! He is probably the best professor at DePaul. He really knows the subject, and wants his students to know it too. If you need a religion requirement, or just a religion class for fun TAKE FATHER BILL!!! its a great class - very non-secular, even though its taught by a priest.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2005<br>Class Name: REL223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yeah, this sounds sick but he IS hot for an old man. I wouldnt mind my husband looking like that at that age :) But seriously, Hes the BEST PROFESSOR EVER. I wish he was the priest at my church because I would be looking forward to it! Hes AMAZING!!! Take him!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2005<br>Class Name: REL202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>coolest teacher really funny and just an easy class take it to learn interesting stuff and get an A along the way.
