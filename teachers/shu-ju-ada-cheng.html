She truly cares about her students and is willing to help in any way possible. There is a lot of reading in class but Ada does a good job explaining harder concepts. I really like that her classes are all about dialogue and participation. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2015<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ada is a great woman. She's quirky, hilarious, and has a way of engaging students & making the lecture interesting. The only negative is the amount of reading she requires, but if you stay on top of things and pay attention you'll do fine. In other classes I find myself watching the clock, but her humor made me lose track of time. Take her class! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2015<br>Class Name: SOC309<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>We talk about pretty taboo things that you don't normally get the chance to discuss in academia. 4 papers with 10% grade each, 4 discussions with 10% each, participation 20%.  She has high standards for quality of writing, but the books are interesting. Sexually conservative people will feel uncomfortable in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2014<br>Class Name: 209<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>It is hard NOT to love Ada. Eclectic and amazing are two words to describe her. Her lectures are mostly discussion based, but its fun and you can draw in personal narrative to help. 4 books, 3 book reports- You picked which you didn't write a paper on. Participation is important. Want to take another class with her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2012<br>Class Name: SOC309<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome class. Write a couple papers and talk in class. Very interesting subject matter and Ada knows her stuff! Great if you're a Soc major, but get to take if you need to fill an elective and want to take an interesting class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2007<br>Class Name: SOC495<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is so weird and funny.  Class was 100% discussion based but I wish she did not require so much reading.  I had a hard time keeping up. 7 books in about 2 months!  But she is a very fair grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2006<br>Class Name: SOCGENDER<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Did I even take her class&#63; Other than grading my papers, I'm not sure what this prof did.  Spoke maybe 5 minutes per 3 hour class.  Normally I wouldn't mind, but the students in this class constantly were off-topic... drove me crazy that she just sat there. I would take her courses again, but I wouldn't rush to sign up.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2006<br>Class Name: SOC309<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She rocks!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2006<br>Class Name: SOC309<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>unrealistic workload with lots of reading, but she is an easy grader and the books are interesting...great documentaries, very open and laid back but that sometimes means ****s in the class with nothing to say take over discussions</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2005<br>Class Name: SOC209<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ada is the best at DePaul!

Her class was interesting and easy. The only thing I would change from her class would be the long lectures she tends to give. It would be better if it was more interactive.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2004<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ada is so open about topics and we watched a lot of really good documentaries and films.

Ada makes the class fun, and the material is interesting, although nothing new for the openminded.  She's definitely kooky, but in a charming way. Sometimes it gets annoying, though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2004<br>Class Name: SOCWOMEN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Ada!
