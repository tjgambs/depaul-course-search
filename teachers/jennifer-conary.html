Yep. She's tough, but she really helps to improve student writing. She is incredibly knowledgable! If you want an easy class do not take Conary. If you want to learn and are ready to work for your grade TAKE CONARY! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2015<br>Class Name: ENG245<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Conary's classes are predictable, but I liked her format of lecture and discussion. She has the class keep a blog which is pretty cool-- I've never had an English prof do that. She is a tough grader but you turn in a draft before the final so she gives you her thoughts before and you can then change your paper accordingly. Really nice person. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2015<br>Class Name: ENG340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I love novels and not so much poetry, so if you don't like reading, don't take this class. But if you do the reading, the quizzes are easy, you can get easy participation points in class discussions and on the course blog. Her lectures are informative and she loves talking about this period. She is also great at giving feedback on papers!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/22/2014<br>Class Name: ENG245<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Professor Conary - the passion she has for the books that she teaches is incredible, and I had a wonderful educational experience. She gets you to really think about the not-so-obvious aspects of the novels, and provides excellent background information and historical context. If you put the time in and do the reading, you can get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2014<br>Class Name: ENG382<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Conary is the greatest! Sure--she isn't the easiest grader, but that just means that doing well actually on her assignments actually feels like an accomplishment! She is very passionate about what she is teaching and truly cares about her students' success!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2014<br>Class Name: ENG382<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Quizzes are easy points.. person below is bitter.  If you do the work you'll get a good grade. Professor Conary is passionate about literature and was super helpful via comments. This was a RESEARCH CLASS so you were expected to do the reading in order to do the final paper. Not the easiest grader but overall helped me become a better writer. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2014<br>Class Name: ENG245<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>This class could be a bit heavy on reading at times, but she tried her best to split it up, and if you're an English major, reading is expected. Lots of opportunities to gain points (quizzes, blogs, etc.). Very helpful feedback on my paper. Not sure about the final yet, but everything else was very straightforward. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2014<br>Class Name: ENG245<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Professor Conary! She is so great at explaining the novels and the lectures were so enjoyable! There's only 2 papers and they are not bad at all, but the second one is a little more time consuming but she is always available for help and definitely take her up on it! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2014<br>Class Name: ENG382<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>One of, if not the, most difficult classes I've taken at DePaul. She gives reading quizzes every class (really? are we 5?) It's an insane amount of reading piled on with papers for such a short period of time. Hardcore regretting this class, and wouldn't recommend this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2014<br>Class Name: ENG340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Conary is NOT a good professor. She was not helpful and I ended up dropping because she was so rude to me, outside of class. I took the course with another professor and got an A.  Although she was very knowledgeable when discussing the readings, a professor should NEVER behave the way she did.  I would not recommend her to anyone. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2014<br>Class Name: ENG340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Easily one of my favorite professors at DePaul. Incredibly demanding class, but if you stay on top of the reading you will get a lot out of it. She always fosters really interesting conversations about the literature, and gets you interested in other books too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2014<br>Class Name: ENG231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>VERY difficult grader, but the class is very worthwhile! I had no interest in the subject, but Conary is an amazing professor and I was very invested in the material. I ended up taking a second class with her just because she is the sweetest professor at DePaul. Take her classes!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2014<br>Class Name: ENG340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good lectures she definitely knows her material and loves it. That being said, she is a very hard grader. Three demanding ENG classes later I see the work I put in papers and participation were not worth it. Could be fantastic if only she relaxed and enjoyed the awesome conversations and opinions that are possible with the great texts provided.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/14/2013<br>Class Name: ENG231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Conary is an amazing professor.  Her class is definitely not an easy A, you have to make sure to attend all classes and also make sure to complete the assigned readings.  She is a very helpful, passionate, and knowledgeable professor who gives clear instructions on what she wants done for class and how she wants it done.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2013<br>Class Name: ENG368<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Conary is fantastic. Her class is a lot of work, so don't expect an easy A. Whenever I received a good great, I felt like I actually earned it, and I improved my writing skills tremendously. This class was extremely helpful, and now I know how to do better research than ever before.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2013<br>Class Name: ENG382<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher! Not the easiest grader, but she's fair. The workload is also not overwhelming, even though most of the older comments say otherwise. She's passionate for the material and is always willing to help her students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2013<br>Class Name: ENG231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teacher is really nice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2013<br>Class Name: ENG231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class. Always had really interesting conversations about the books, and there were only two moderately difficult essays.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2013<br>Class Name: ENG231GOTHIC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is extremely rigorous in her course expectations, however she does not make success impossible. She is extremely smart, and expects her class to rise to her level. If you want to learn, and are up for the challange, then be ready to commit. She will definitely make you smarter. Side note: Her version of a 200 level class is a 300 level.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2013<br>Class Name: ENG231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Conary is definitely a tough professor, but she doesn't ask for anything her students aren't capable of doing. She's willing to work with you if you're having problems, and anyone I know who's done poorly in her classes brought it upon themselves. I'd recommend her to any English major who wants a good, thorough understanding of material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2013<br>Class Name: ENG231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really great teacher, very invested in the material. Always generated really interesting conversations about the novels. Only about 3 essays, and those were not that hard. Major Buffy and Joss Whedon fan, assigning Buffy episodes for a final project. Highly recommend taking her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2013<br>Class Name: ENG231<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She either no longer enforces the weekly essay or she simply didn't require it for this class, but we only had two major papers. She's a tough paper grader, but she's fair and she's very helpful and interested in what she's teaching. I found this class really worthwhile</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/06/2012<br>Class Name: ENG340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took for a Jane Austen film and lit class (275) as well as the 19th-century british lit class (340). if you want an easy class, don't take her.   But both of the classes I've taken with her have been rewarding. She's intelligent and passion.  Definitely take her if you want to be a better writer and a better person :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2012<br>Class Name: ENG340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I find the weekly 2 pg paper a bit daunting, and it doesn't help me read, only helps me skim. Maybe replace it with a quiz? Other than that, ENG majors TAKE HER! She is sweet, gives good lectures, AND ACTUALLY TAKES THE TIME TO GRADE YOUR PAPER! Really helpful if you see yourself writing on literature in the future. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2012<br>Class Name: ENG340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Conary is the worst professor I've had out of my four years at DePaul. I received my first and last F at DePaul from her on a midterm paper, I believe. The paper wasn't great, but her comments were inappropriate and unnecessary. It was very unprofessional. She is also very biased on many subjects, which makes the class not as enjoyable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2011<br>Class Name: ENG340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jennifer Conary is one of the few profs who gives a damn about her students. The effort she puts into grading your paper WILL make you a better writer. True students will appreciate this professor. In response to a previous post: Professor Conary holds a PhD. This means that she is, in fact, a successful writer!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2011<br>Class Name: ENG340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor conary is honestly awful. She had no true teaching skills. She knows her stuff but has no idea how to go about teaching it. It seems as if she is a failed writer and teaching was some kind of second option. I would not recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/06/2011<br>Class Name: ENG349<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>In my eighteen years of school, Conary is in my top three professors ever. Her passion for literature is unparalleled and her knowledge of 19th Century English is off the charts. She's also tough as nails, but completely fair. If you get an A in her class, it's impossible not to feel a sense of accomplishment.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2011<br>Class Name: ENG349<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yes, it's true: all she does is STAND THERE and TALK ABOUT BOOKS. But really, who is taking such a high level English class if not an English major, and why are you an English major if you don't like to discuss literature&#63; Her classes are some of the few at DePaul where I feel like I'm actually learning something. Don't take her unless you care.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2011<br>Class Name: ENG349<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very boring class. She stands in one place and lectures the entire period about the books. While thorough, a lot of the information becomes extraneous and not useful for the exam- it's just like she's trying to fill the entire 3hours. Don't expect to get out of class even a minute early. VERY TOUGH GRADER. This is not a prof you can get by easily.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/24/2010<br>Class Name: ENG340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Conary needs to improve her teaching significantly.  She is boring.  Her lectures are dry and overly fact-laden.  She does not make it clear what she expects you to remember from them.  Provides no focus for exam and midterm review.  Also, she comes of as condescending and disparages her students for failing At easy work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2010<br>Class Name: ENG349<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Conary is hands-down one of the most engaging English professors at DePaul. She is passionate about her subject and appears to have a blast talking about it. Her lectures were entertaining and clever, and she presented ideas about well-known novels that I had never encountered before. I hope to take another of her classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2010<br>Class Name: ENG245<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is not so bad but there is a lot of busy work. She is also a stiffer about typos.  However I did enjoy the books in class and so found the discussion of them interesting. Its doable, but like I said, filled with busy work- no let up during finals, midterms, or even the first week. Oh and read cause quizzes are a real nuisance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2010<br>Class Name: ENG245<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had next to no interest in British novels when I started this class and anticipated torture. However, she found a way to get me to at least respect the novels by the end of the quarter. The class is a ton of work but it pays off. She gives a lot of feedback on papers and acknowledges improvement. The reading can be crazy at times but its doable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2010<br>Class Name: END340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are lazy, do not take her class. If you care and are willing to work hard, by all means she is an incredible professor. She expects a lot of her students, but if you do your reading, which is not an unreasonable amount, and you write your papers and ask her for help, you will do just fine. Love her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2010<br>Class Name: ENG340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>tough teacher to work with, proves that shes better than everyone else and students tend to fall asleep in her class. gives weekly reading responses and several long essays to write with long books to read. pretty much makes sure you fail and makes finals difficult, even keeps tell students that they will fail. really boring and uninteresting!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2009<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want a teacher who is rude,incompetent, dull, boring, and not worthy of having a teaching license than by all means take her. I was taking a jane austen class with her and I thought it would be awesome but it was utter hell. We didn't do anything, but sit and hear her whine about things that had nothing to do with the reading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2009<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although this is a discussion based class, there seems to be no true discussion, and Ms.Conary seems to recite her lecture, despite what other students may have to say. There is little use going to class, and it is usually very slow. The reading is usually easy, but the essays are a dramatic leap from the usual work in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2009<br>Class Name: ENG245<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Conary is very passionate about the books read in the class, and provides a lot of historical context to make the class very interesting. She is very approachable and reasonable. There is a decent amount of reading although it is completely manageable. Highly recommended to take, she is a great professor.</div></div></div></body></html>
