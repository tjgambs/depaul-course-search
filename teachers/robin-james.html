She encourages class participation, but when you say something she makes you feel like a dumbass. If you take her I recommend keeping your mouth shut and taking good notes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>robin rocked. she was super helpful and willing to help you on your papers. open discussion, which allowed me to think. im so glad i took her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Missed classes often due to special circumstances, not at all helpful for the class, though we did have online class on blackboard. Some material was very difficult to understand, notes were kind of sporadic, was only able to follow b/c I was interested in the topics we discussed. Do your assgn's/reading, participate and you'll get a C at least.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is easy and interesting. Connects material to modern day. Lectures are effective. Can easily get an A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2005<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is amazingly well versed in philosophy and teaching. The only way you could not like her is if you dont do the homework. (which she expects you to because your a college student) Shes very helpful if you have any questions and always willing to show you your grade or keep contact with questions. She is what teachers should be.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2005<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She looks like she was an extra for the Matrix before she was teaching.  Hear daily assignments are a joke and grading is sporadic at best.  The big group project is the easiest thing to pull out of your ass.  Overall, I can't stand her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/28/2005<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's really a bad teacher you have to do these assigments that are so hard to understand and the material is diffcult itslef but can be simplified. Grading is done very weird and she can be very misleading</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2005<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice and super helpful.
