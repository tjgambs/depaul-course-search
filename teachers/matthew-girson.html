The irony class was fantastic--it really broadened my horizons and made me think in ways I never had. Reading is heavy in the first front of the quarter, but there's no reading in the second half. He builds in class-time to work on individual research papers. Highly recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2014<br>Class Name: ART200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome, awesome, awesome teacher. Definitely need a general interest in art, otherwise I wouldn't bother. One of my favorite teachers, you learn a lot and he's an easy grader. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2013<br>Class Name: ART206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a fun class! He is one of the most fun professors ever! So nice and helpful. He is a little out there and cooky but that's what makes him awesome. Take him if you want to learn and have fun!   Just a side note- most of the supplies you don't use so buy them as you need them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2011<br>Class Name: HON205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Journal assignments take a while, but they're not so bad once you get into them. Very clear in what he expects from students. Loved the class, love this professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2011<br>Class Name: ART200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Passionate about art, loves class discussion and interactive, easy on the eyes too. rawwwrr.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2010<br>Class Name: ART200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an amazing teacher and very in love with what he is doing. At first his assignments may seem confusing but he wants you to do well so don't be afraid to ask for help!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2009<br>Class Name: ISP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>can't recommend this dude enough; the one class at depaul that really impressed me. very interesting stuff and he's very passionate about all of it. lots of discussion so if you can't think abstractly gtfo. weooooo.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2009<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He totally changed the way I understand the progression of art. He is so crazy excited about what he's doing and its pretty contagious. The readings were a little demanding, but I've ended up referencing them in classes following. There is some truth to things not being totally clear, but if you go to class, you'll be more than fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2009<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This turned out to be my favorite class freshmen year. He makes mediocrity fun, even in a night class. You can really take away a lot from this class. He's also a pretty easy grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class really kind of sucked at first but got a lot better in the end. The whole time I really liked him though.  He is a nice guy, but if your a very narrow minded person or someone who needs logic in the classroom I would not recommend</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class totally wasn't what I expected, but at the end of the day it was a pretty decent class. It started off slow, but it picked up. The subject matter is really abstract, so you are going to have to think. He tries to be humourous and his attempts are funny. He is a fairly tough grader so watch out. Take him if you want to think a lot!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2007<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very unclear about what he wants.  I'm sure he's a nice guy but he's just so horribly unclear that he shouldn't be teaching.  Class was so boring I wanted to scream</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2007<br>Class Name: HON300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This turned out to be such a great class. He is very insightful and makes such a huge effort to get to know each student individually. He is always available for help and to answer questions. He sends out summary emails each week with reminders, too. I ususally HATE honors classes, but this was a great class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2005<br>Class Name: INTDRAWING<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably the best art class I've taken at DePaul, but sometimes got a weird vibe from him though, overall, great professor and great class (Hows that for a complement sandwich ;) )</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2005<br>Class Name: DRAWINGPAINT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely one of the few professors who &quot;gets it.&quot; Agreed with all above comments. He also shows interest in every single student and develops a positive working relationship with each one. His classes were definitely some of the best I have taken at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2005<br>Class Name: PAINTING<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>one of the best teachers in the art dept. you really don't realize how much you learn until the class is actually over... i would highly recomend him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2004<br>Class Name: ART<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>what a good teacher.

He makes things very clear and easy to understand. He also puts emphasis on absorbring the material as a whole, not picky so much about dates and the little stuff, so long as you try to comprehend the bigger picture.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2004<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a great guy, real nice, willing to answer any questions.</div></div></div></body></html>
