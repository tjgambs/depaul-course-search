He TRULY cares about his students and wants to make sure everyone understands the material and does what it takes to be successful. He is also hilarious during lectures and makes the whole class laugh. I hope to take more classes with him. He is very knowledgable. Awesome, sweet, and hilarious guy. Definitely take him!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2013<br>Class Name: BIO339<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Norstrom is one of the best professors I've had during my last 4 years at DePaul. He is incredibly concerned about the progress of his students and is always available outside of class to clarify the material. He is also incredibly nice and understanding. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2013<br>Class Name: BIO201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far my favorite teacher at DePaul. Cares very much about his students and will do all he can to help. He is funny in his lectures and is a very smart man. You have to study to do well in his class. He will go above and beyond to help you if your struggling in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2013<br>Class Name: BIO339<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Recommend.  Straight forward teacher who knows A LOT about neuroscience.  Entertaining dry and witty humor.  Really nice powerpoints but lectures are crucial to go to.  He was very gracious when I had to miss lots of class for med school interviews and was extremely helpful during office hours one on one.  Recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2012<br>Class Name: BIO201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was my hardest class at DePaul yet.. but that is not Dr. Norstrom's fault. You can tell he cares about his students. He is respectful. He pretty much explains the slides of his power points during lecture to approx. 100 students in the class. The tests cover ALOT of material. Extremely difficult class. Don't take this before the general bio.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/29/2012<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him in lecture and lab. He was VERY helpful in labs and always made sure you understood what you were doing. In lecture, he was a little more boring. He is very knowledgable though and will always happily answer questions. I definitely recommend him! He's also a super nice guy which is a plus.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2012<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great professor and really tries hard to connect with his students.</div></div></div></body></html>
