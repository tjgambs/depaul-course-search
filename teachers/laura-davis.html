She hates when people ask questions to clarify but none of her assignments make sense. She talks about nothing usually and the class is extremely boring. The class is easy but shes such a crazy and frustrating person that it's not even worth taking the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2008<br>Class Name: ANT105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class started off good, but went severely downhill. Apparently, asking questions means the class is unengaged. She says questions take up too much time, but they wouldn't if she didn't go off on tangents. Rarely get to finish films. I think she had it right when she said she probably won't teach this class again. Avoid.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2008<br>Class Name: ANT105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class had so much potential. Sadly, it failed to deliver. Her attempt to engage the class in discussions just never worked. I found myself doodling and counting the minutes for it to finish. She would randomly kick students out of the class too. I'm pretty sure this would have been an amazing class, had there been a better teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2008<br>Class Name: ANT120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know what planet this woman is on but it is not Earth. She is kind of crazy but her class is super easy. It was a joke. Her lectures are boring and sometimes she just does not make sense. It is clear that she definitely likes her female students more than the males. Do not take her unless you have to. It's so hard to get up and go to class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2008<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I absolutely despised this class.  it started off on a strange note, but after the first week was impossible to follow.  Her classes were boring, her personality can be best described as bipolar, her grading was irrational and she usually got angry when she was asked to answer a question.  an easy A, but not worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2008<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible, just terrible! I was super interested in Anthropology before I took this class and she ruined it for me. She is completely scatterbrained, and while I initially liked her she became incomprehensible to me, and if you dont share her crazy love of Margaret Mead she pretty much hates you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/22/2007<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I got a lot out of the class. Interesting assignments that are hands on, readings that give you an alternative view of the world and great teacher. Take this class if you want to challenge yourself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2007<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was one of the best classes i took so far. The professor is interesting and cares about the students. I learned a lot about anthropology, mostly because it wasnt just about the readings, but also about going out and exploring different areas in order to complete the assignments. Great class! Interesting and dedicated professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2007<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is one of the most scattered teachers i've ever had. She speaks in idioms and vagaries  like &quot;what do you think of it,&quot; the operative word being an unidentified &quot;it.&quot; then she wonders why nobody raises their hands. then she gets off track rebuking our sources and stuff and then forms hypotheses about our behavior. it's funny to watch i guess.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2007<br>Class Name: ANTH102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She really thinks that everything she has to say is the most important ever and if your not paying attention she'll call you out on it and yells like a psyco infront of everyone. Not to mention this class had a lot of potential and she sucked it up..plus, she looks like a vulture and it was painful to come to class and see her ...but easy class...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2007<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'd take any class from her. A final where you go exploring & take photos. Can't beat that. You also study MySpace & see very interesting films. Recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2007<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ughh. she drove me nuts. the class itself wasn't too bad, but she annoyed the crap out of me. Shes not very clear in what she wants from you until AFTER you have already turned the assignment in (which won't be until considerably later in the quarter). she sent me an email today, AFTER her final telling me to rewrite a paper from a month ago</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2007<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Most pointless class of my life...did not talk about anything in class and wrote a lot of useless papers.  Took her the whole quarter to get us any of our papers back...I am sure i will get an A but she is just really crazy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easiest class I've taken, but at the same time, one of the most mind numbing. Half of the class must have just been awkward pauses from pointless questions she asked. Class could have been very interesting, ended up being awful. I felt like I could have written anything down on 5 pages and gotten 100 percent.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2007<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's not the most motivating or organized teacher. However, I found the readings and topics to be really really interesting. Do the assignments and talk in class every once in a while and you can get an easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2007<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Too harsh. Cool assignments. Lots to think about. If you follow along and go to class, the class is a breeze. Easy grader and nice person. I'd recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2007<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice lady but very scatterbrained.Almost all the reading is on the internet and the readings are almost always too long to bother printing.1-2 short essays a week which really adds up.Most assignments are boring but a couple were cool.Her grading seemed unfair and she often took off points from my assignments wtih no reasoning.Don't recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2007<br>Class Name: ANTHR103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was the most unorganized class i've ever taken. i never knew what was going on at all, plus she messes up grades so badly. Very aggravating class with little work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/15/2007<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It is still her first year teaching I think, so she needs to work out the schedule a little better. The assignments were very easy and she was nice. I got a 100% in the class, so I don't know why people are so bent out of shape about her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2007<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lots of small assignments, but fun projects. MySpace, observing people, photo essays. More hands-on.   Interesting readings & films. Recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2007<br>Class Name: ANT101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>NICE LADY BUT NEVER CLEAR ON SYLLABUS. PAPERS AFTER PAPERS AND PROJECTS DAT WERE UNCLEAR. TOUGH &#63; 4 ASSIGN. N DOESNT LIKE IT IF U DONT AGREE W WHAT SHE THINKS/SAYS. AVOID HER CLASS IF U LIKE TO HAVE A CLEAR CLASS.
