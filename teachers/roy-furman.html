The topic itself is interesting if only he were a bit more organized. PARTICIPATE, it helps both of you stay on track. Complaint: too much assigned work. Handouts, hour long videos and finishing a lot of novels. quizzes are short but broad and no finals but 2 essays.

Furman is knowledgeable on religion but lack open mindedness when students speak up about personal opinions. Lecturing was monotonous and repetitive.

He was very clear with his requirements. His quizzes were exactly what we talked about in class and he gives you a study sheet with everything on it.

Very interesting class. 4 simple quizzes (asks random &#63;s though)& 2 papers (he was not very clear on what he wanted). Speak up in class, your grade depends on it. extra credit available</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2011<br>Class Name: REL103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I feel like this professor shouldn't be teaching a WORLD RELIGIONS class, because all you get is his ideas about a religion that he doesn't seem to know much about. I feel as if this whole class has just been a bunch of guess work. He also doesn't let students speak up. It takes an hour for him to answer five student's questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2011<br>Class Name: REL103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought the class was going to be very interesting before I attended but it turned out to be boring at times.  He uses the whole class period to just talk, talk , talk.  Reading everything he assigns is crucial because he is always giving quizzes on it.  He is an overall nice man, but his lectures are what makes the class boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/06/2010<br>Class Name: REL103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I personally think he makes this class harder than it needs to be. It would have been more interesting if he switched up his style: either properly lecture us or let us fully discuss it rather than a bit here and there. Participation is a KILLER part of your overall grade -which is hard when he interrupts alot. Reading is essential.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2008<br>Class Name: REL103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Furman...knows his stuff.  There is lots of reading to do.  You need to read 3 books and other blackboard articles and the midterm and final are easy...if you study the review guid.  There are 2 paper and he will help you if you ask.  Just show him that u want to learn things and his willing to help you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2008<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he gives a ton of reading, his classes are boring, he shows clear favoritism, and he's sort of distant. However, his assignments are worth your time as the prompts are asked in a way that really challenges your knowledge and requires you to create ideas and apply things to your real life. You will learn A LOT in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2008<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was very disappointed with this class. He is vague (like others said) on assignments and seems to grade more on whether or not you followed the prompt exactly to his liking rather than context. It isn't easy to get an A in his class. Also, he can be rude when you're participating (which he forces you to do) and will cut you off.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2008<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Agree with the post below me: he was pretty vague in his wording of the assignments. You do, however, have the option to run the two papers by him first, as rough drafts, so that is recommended. I personally found him boring, but the &quot;yeah religion!&quot;-type people might find him interesting...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2008<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very idealistic.

I (a Finance Major) had no business in this 300 level class. The material was SOOOO boring, and I struggled to get through the massive amount of reading. Thusly, I struggled on the tests. I think I failed both tests, but did make an effort to talk in class. Hard final paper, but I got a B in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/02/2007<br>Class Name: REL109<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You will be ok if you keep up with the readings.

He is extremely ethusiastic and loves teaching. He wants everyone to do well and will stretch test gades as far as he can. There is a lot of reading and notes, but if you do the work and attend lectures it's not hard to get an A. I highly recommend his classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2007<br>Class Name: REL109<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst prof.

If you are a religious person like I am, you will be challenged, but it is nothing faith shaking. Lots of reading, so try to keep up.
