If he doesnt make something clear, just ask. Recommend him. The homework is a lot, but it is requirement for the class with any professor. I enjoyed his class as much as you can for a math class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2012<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nicest guy, his lecture notes are exactly what's on the exams and in class assignments. Never had to stay the entire class. Only down side was everything was group assignments. Great teacher I've never understood math more.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/08/2011<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Jeon is pretty chill, but kinda boring. got through the material quickly, then the class went off and did the in class assignments. Not that hard, got out early. He brought our class pizza. QRC lab person helped more than he  did. not horrible for a gen ed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2011<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you have a choice, I would recommend NOT taking a class with Josh Jeon. As people have mentioned, he is sarcastic and quite boring. If you struggle with math, good luck, because Josh is not helpful either in or out of class. He means well but seems like he hates his job as much as you will probably hate his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2011<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was easy, but he's extremely sarcastic and was of hardly any help throughout the quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2010<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy but when i asked for help he didn't offer any outside help or anything. He doesn't seem like he wants to be in class and will fly through the lectures. Good luck!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2010<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's definitely nice, but isnt the greatest teacher.
