He tries to get everyone in the class engaged in discussion&loves to get feedback about his teaching style from students. He can go off on tangents&get off topic sometimes, but it is all aimed towards what he wants us to learn. Only puts stuff on tests that is covered in classpapers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2014<br>Class Name: CMNS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>He can come off a little harsh in how he speaks to students, and how he grades. But, you will learn a lot from his class. Be prepared to come into the classroom with a lot of discussion topicspoints. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2013<br>Class Name: CMNS315<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing Professor!! Approachable and a very  nice man.  If you seem interested in the class and do the work, you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2013<br>Class Name: CMNS315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've rarely taken a class that I was sorry to see end but Dr. Baglia's class is one of them. I'm a Health Sciences major and this class iss outstanding. He assigns a lot of work but provides detailed assignment guides as well as specific rubrics that tell you what you need to do to succeed. He's interesting and interested in students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2013<br>Class Name: CMNS315<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Health Science students, avoid this class! Professor goes on long unrelated rants about his personal life, is more interested in personal anecdotes then actual data. Class material is redundant, and ultimately futile a health major. He is incredibly nit picky on writing assignments and is not explicit about why you received a certain grade. AVOID!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2013<br>Class Name: CMNS509<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jay is very approachable & helpful, maybe borderline too laid back. He isn't one of the those hard a*s professors who swamp you in work. His class was good overall, although sometimes unengaging. I still spent several hours every week on coursework but it wasn't as intense as other cmns profs. I would recommend him & I'm glad I took his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2013<br>Class Name: CMNS523<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>FOR A COMMUNICATIONS PROFESSOR HE IS TERRIBLE AT COMMUNICATING! refuses to give criteria or assignment parameters yet GRADES HARSHLY, AND feedback is confusing and often comments contradict each other. but talking to him in person is even worse! talk about kids and tell stories about yourself that waste time and have nothing to do with class = an A</div></div></div></body></html>
