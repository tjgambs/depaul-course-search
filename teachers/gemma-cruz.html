She's also respectful and considerate. She tends to be very serious in class but I think that's really her personality. In any case she's certainly a great teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2011<br>Class Name: CTH110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you study hard you'll get a really good grade. One of my most memorable professors (in a good way) at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2011<br>Class Name: CTH243<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the most punctual and organized teachers I have ever had. Very smart and open-minded too. Learned a ton from her class. Take her class if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2011<br>Class Name: CTH110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her class was a real-learning experience. She brings a global experience and perspective to the classroom. The learning aids were particularly enlightening. You would have to really work hard for your grade but do not hesitate to take her class. You'll learn a lot!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2011<br>Class Name: CTH101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I absolutely love her! The thought cards were an effective tool for learning, especially as they force me to read and engage my seatmate. Cruz is very understanding. She even lends her books for help in writing papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2011<br>Class Name: CTH110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've taken two courses with this professor and she is one of the best at DePaul. She can be strict with attendance and rules but these are all clearly laid out in the syllabus so the complaints about her policies are a bit unfair.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2011<br>Class Name: REL180<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very professional. Has high but reasonable standards.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2011<br>Class Name: CTH2<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Try not to listen to the bad comments about this professor. If you want to relly learn, take her. If you want an easy grade, she's not your type of teacher. She's very helpful. You can learn a lot from her. I particularly like how she links religion stuff with real life and real people.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2011<br>Class Name: CTH110<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE TEACHER! DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS! the class is interesting, but Cruz sucks. you can't even undersand her most of the time, and her tests are ridiculous. readings every day, and she makes you do a note card on everything you do. NOT WORTH IT. WORST TEACHER EVER!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2011<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is absolutely the most ridiculous woman ever. She requires not only bibliographies but footnotes as well (same citing). If you do not have one or the other she will accuse you of &quot;Academic Dishonesty&quot;. Time to get over yourself, Gemma!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2011<br>Class Name: CTH201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>JUST TERRIBLE. SHES ASIAN AND DEFINITELY THE MOST BORING TEACHER I HAVE EVER HAD</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2011<br>Class Name: CAT180<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst. took it only because I studied catholicism for 12 years thinking this would be easy, definitely not, got a C. Most boring class Ive taken at DePaul. The class was literally painful to take.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2010<br>Class Name: REL180<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WARNING DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. SHE IS TERRIBLE DO NOT LISTEN TO THE OTHERS ON THIS TEACHER. I found her to be belittling, uninformative, and evangelical to a crazy level. She is super smart and well published but doesn't make her a good teacher. Quizzes are hard and annoying as well as her 10 page paper for an intro class Unless u love catholics</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2010<br>Class Name: REL180<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is easy, but just make sure you know it's boring... very boring.  If you just need to take a religious class to meet your requirements, take her for the easy A or B.  Just make sure for the papers you talk to her ahead of time about you want to talk about or give her an outline.  She isn't always clear on what she wants.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2010<br>Class Name: CTH110<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this class is miserable. avoid her at all costs. she is boring, her quizzes suck, she takes participation points and calls on you to answer questions about the previous nights readings. she cares about attendance, cell phones, and if you leave class early she is email you asking why. its honestly like being in high school again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2010<br>Class Name: CTH180<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>not a bad class. 2 papers, 3 quizzes, final, and 1 notecard due on a reading each class. boring...... but pretty easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2009<br>Class Name: REL180<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice lady and easy class. Though it maybe be very boring at times, she presents the material in a way which is straight forward. There were 2quizs, 2papaers, a final, and a notecard due each day which sucked. The class is a breeze although you may fall asleep.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2009<br>Class Name: CTH243<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was interesting. You only read 1 chpt per class...which is easy compared to some teachers assigning many a nite. 2 extremely easy quizzes, turn in a note card per day and 1 easy paper on your opinion and one reasearch paper. Also an extremely easy final. highly recommned her!!!</div></div></div></body></html>
