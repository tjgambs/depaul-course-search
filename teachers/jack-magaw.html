Very laidback but still expects you to put in work.  It's a lot of fun.  I got to write a play and it was an amazing experience.  At the end of the quarter, other students in the class acted out I wrote.  Honestly, one of the coolest and most rewarding class.  Jack in the man.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2006<br>Class Name: DESIGNWORKSHOP<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>if you actually pay attention and listen you will learn more than you would expect.  pay attention and you will get more than your monies worth.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2006<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy.
