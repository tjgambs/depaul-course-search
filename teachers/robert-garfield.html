He wrote his own book so it's cheap and clear what he wants you to know if you bother to read it and it drills home what he's probably looking for in the test. Pretty dry until you ask questions and show interest. Really study 2 chapters and their notes and you're good. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/28/2014<br>Class Name: HST113<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Run for the hills! The whole grade is based off of 2 essay tests that are graded impossibly hard. Class is straight lecture with no PowerPoints or videos, only the occasional map on the overhead. No structure to the class, just him lecturing. Made no effort to engage students. Bad class if you're a visual learner. Only plus is that prof is helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2014<br>Class Name: HST113<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WORST PROFESSOR EVER! He is such a harsh grader, and makes every student in class feel like they are stupid.  Definitely do not recommend this professor.  You have to study all the time and he makes you write in pen on tests or else he will not even read the essay! Do not take this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2014<br>Class Name: HST112<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Garfield is a nice person, but not the best professor.  I was already getting a D in the class week 3 and I am a straight A student.  Too much work is required for a 100 level history class.  He grades way to hard and expects way too much.  Try to avoid.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2013<br>Class Name: HST236<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is really interesting and I learned a lot. However, Garfield is a HARD grader. His tests are very hard and he wants a lot of detail in the essay portion. For that reason, reading is mandatory, and there's a lot of it. If you're looking for an easy A, do not take him. But if you're looking to learn a lot and be challenged, this is perfect</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2013<br>Class Name: HIST252<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Garfield is literally one of the best instructors I have ever learned from! I don't know where some of these people are getting the idea that he's unsympathetic to students and strict. He is a very nice man and makes his lectures entertaining and extremely informative. Take notes and be specific and you'll do fine! Try to take a class with him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2012<br>Class Name: HST252<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Garfield is a great history teacher! His lectures are fast and in depth, so make sure to take lots of notes and never skip class! Also, the textbooks are important, but not hard to read at all. Three exams, and one paper 6-10 pages.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2012<br>Class Name: HIST132<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Garfield made history interesting for me!  If lecture classes are your style you will learn a lot!  His exams are different from other professors' because they follow his narrative rather than fact-based style, which might be why people have trouble, but I found his clear expectations for homework and exams to be easy to meet.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2012<br>Class Name: HST132<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an excellent lecturer, more of a storyteller really. I loved the material. 3 exams, all graded hard (matching maps section and pick one essay question) and one biography paper which he does not give a lot of info on. Do NOT have to read, covers a lot of info each lecture. TAKE NOTES and be detailed on exam essays</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2011<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had to write a paper for every class.

The overall rating of this teacher is not accurate. The guy talks about how his students at Northwestern didn't even get it...as he teaches the same lecture at DePaul and expecting the same. I went to every class, read, and went in for help and i got an F!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2010<br>Class Name: HST252<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I personally loved him.

I've never seen so many students cry before a test. You will study for days and still only get an A. He will tell you a city becomes a state, but tell you how to remember it for the test. Essays need to be VERY detailed! He giggled when students did poor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/01/2010<br>Class Name: HST132<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>*** AVOID *** - This prof must rate himself - Taught at a 300 level. over 100 locations to memorize on a map per test. 6 pg essays on each test. He will give you the WRONG info when u see him in is office. I am a 4.0 student and know how to work for my grade... this guy is way off track with his teaching...

His class consists of three tests.

Very shocked, he is fair, and does teach on university level, but exams are very difficult. I went in expecting an easy history class, but i was wrong, it needs a lot of time outside of class and will fail if you don&quot;t read the book</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2010<br>Class Name: HIST101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awsome professor. If you take good notes, you don't even need to read the book. Three tests that consist of maps and an essay - one essay for each topic covered, therefore it's enough to know one topic inside-out and you will get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2009<br>Class Name: HST112<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>doesnt give notes.

I am definitely not a history buff and found that some of the information went over my head.. I think that he feels that most students have some prior knowledge of the subject which isnt always true.  Your grade consists of 3 tests, a final, and a paper. He is a hard grader. Know your material really well or you wont do well</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2009<br>Class Name: HST113<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A God in the flesh.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>really funny old man, tough grader on papers, but the class mccarthy and the movies was fun. just watched movies and wrote short papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2009<br>Class Name: EUREXPA<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>if you're really interested in history you might do well in this class. it's straight lecture, and grade is based on 3 HARD exams and a paper. write down everything he says, especially the maps. definitely not a blow off class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2008<br>Class Name: HST235<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is not an easy class, however if you're prepared to actually do college level work it is a really interesting class.

He is loud and clear, repeats important concepts over several times. No need to read every class, but book concepts a nice touch on essays. As they said, study the maps and major topics for the essays!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2007<br>Class Name: HST227<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While he is kind of a crabby old man and unapproachable, he knows his stuff.

He was a really great teacher who is extremely intelligent so he can answer any question. He's also very funny and basically turns historical events into an exciting story. Only homework is reading - very straightforward. Highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2007<br>Class Name: HIS220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher/entertainer.

Cant use notes, which is asking a lot. His grading system is the most cracked out I have ever seen. Wont explain it which is curious. Finished grading 25 essay finals in 2 days, hmmm...I wont be taking him again,pretty horrible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2007<br>Class Name: HST218<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best history teachers at DePaul because he gives the damn facts. He doesn't push a political agenda like others in the Dept. and he is entertaining with his cheesy jokes. Great professor if you want to LEARN history through lecture. I learned the most I've ever learned in one of these classes than I did in 5 in other HST courses.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2007<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok, he's not a bad guy but ISP 101 has too many essays. The discussions are boring and raising our hands make it even more boring. If you want to watch old moives(bad and good) and write a paper and have a hard grader. This is your class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/19/2007<br>Class Name: HST201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bottom line: if you take good notes in class, you will do very well.  His lectures are actually pretty entertaining, and they will provide everything you need to know for the tests.  Each essay question option perfectly reflects one day's notes, so as long as you attend one class each test session(and get the map notes) you'll be more than alright.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2007<br>Class Name: HST000<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I regret ever signing up for this class.

Attendance isn't mandatory, but if you want a chance in hell of getting a good grade you have to go to EVERY class.  The map section of the exam is difficult, but impossible if you haven't been to lectures or have a friend who took notes.  Also, seems nice in class, not so outside</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2007<br>Class Name: HST236<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely boring; straight lecture, hard to stay awake. Exams include map tests and essays. There are 3 exams. I got the exact same grade on the essays every time, interpret that how you wish. There is also a term paper which he grades hard. The class itself is easy but his grading is hard. Avoid him if possible, but there is worse out there.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2007<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a pathetic and boring class. He knows it too and that's why the attendance is mandatory. Will dock you points if you're not there or don't participate in his utterly pointless discussions. Have to write 3-5pg papers every week and pretend to laugh at his stupid jokes in class.

Lectures are good: loud and clear, and makes random obscure jokes; knows his stuff. Two exam, final, and a paper.

I never read the book - do not buy it!! When I actually did look over it for the final, it was obvious he lectures straight from it- so don't waste your money!

It's like listening to the History Channel. He is funny, and knows his stuff 100%. 4 tests with fill in the blank map and an essay section with choices on which one you want to write!

He is the worst teacher at DePaul. Never missed a day of class and went to talk him twice. The man is an ASS!!!Sure you think only having a midterm and a final is great, but you would be WRONG!!

It's hard to believe the amount of information he knows. Class time is never wasted- lectures are always interesting and informative.

I really wish I could take this class again! I didn't do well in the class due to a bad midterm grade (one of two grades in the class) I learned so much and didn't want to miss a day (which I don't recommend doing anyways) Please take him, he is an excellent teacher!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2005<br>Class Name: HIS218<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely not the easiest history class, but very passable.

Tests are random pieces of information that you will screw up.  HARD HARD HARD class for it being an intro to 100 level course.  Please do not take him.

He is the author of the book, so he is the ultimate authority. The only grading is of tests, so go to class, take notes, and you had better love lectures as there is little student interaction aside from note taking. Great class overall</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2005<br>Class Name: MCCARTHYMOVIES<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a hard class, but watch out it is true that you must stay on his good side.

His history class was nothing like a stereotypical history class.  Talks in a way that keeps your attention.  No papers, which is a major plus in a history class.  One caveat: his exams are the only part of your grade.

I had this professor last year and then applied to Northwestern where I was accepted. This professor is excellent, and far superior to my current NU history professor.
