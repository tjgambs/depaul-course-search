She sits in on when you fill out her review sheets and then takes them with her.  Class was way too difficult and thats because she has nothing better to do with her time.

Prof is way to demanding for a 2 credit course. Horribly picky and can be extremely mean to students. Take the class with another professor and learn just as much but get an A easily.

The grading seems more based upon her opinions and not how well you write, what is taught in class or what is contained in the book.
