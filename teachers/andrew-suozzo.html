Very nice, always willing to help, and _incredibly_ smart. I could talk for hours with him, he has an incredibly pleasant and interesting personality. Class had 4 essays, midterm, and final; a lot of reading, both book and non-book. Attendance is mandatory. He loves when you talk in class. Take him! You'll enjoy it :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2013<br>Class Name: FRCH201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is lots of emphasis on speaking in this class, but Dr. Suozzo is very understanding of the fact that people have different speaking abilities. Sometimes the workload seemed like a little much although he was a pretty lenient grader. Class time could be boring, but I would still recommend this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2012<br>Class Name: FRCH201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Suozzo is fantastic! Extremely accomplished in his field, passionate about French and eager to give advice, whether it be class-related or otherwise. Don't take this class (hell, don't make French your major or minor) if you don't want to speak it OUT LOUD; he likes when people participate, which isn't difficult to do as he is very forgiving.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2011<br>Class Name: LGQ150<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Though it was a class in LGBTQ studies, it was very G orientated. It was okay but it made me reconsider choosing it as a minor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2010<br>Class Name: FCH201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a funny old man, gives homework everyday, sometimes doesnt answer questions fully but for the most part an ok teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy grader, reading intensive, bring a pillow.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the sweetest professor! Lots of reading, but he discusses it all in class and gives you the topics for mid-term/final so you know what to study. Very passionate about teaching, and very knowledgeable, sweet man. Prompt with returning papers and answering emails- take him for your ISP class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2008<br>Class Name: ISP100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The Chicago Marathon class was really cool. Working the marathon was kind of a disaster but it was fun and got you involved right away. He's a pretty swell guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2007<br>Class Name: FCH201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>PROS: Very intelligent man, knows A LOT about French language and culture; nice, helpful. CONS: Class format. Often several things due at once: 10-20 wrkbk pgs, vocab lists on the day of a test. Pwrpt presentations- we were all constantly interrupted so he could make grammar corrections (distracting!). Compositions, too. Keep working at all times !</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2007<br>Class Name: FCH203<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher, he doesn't make you feel stupid (which i usually do in french class) when you mispronounce something or dont know how to say it.  The tests aren't too bad either, and he's a fair grader.  I was terrified for this class, i was convinced i was in way over my head, but i ended up liking it alot!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Andrew is great.  He's very intelligent, well spoken, and very flexible with his students.  He expects that you'll read the material, participate, and show that you're learning something.  Overall, great class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2006<br>Class Name: FRCH301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A. Suozzo is passionate and kind and a real scholar. He is the model professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof is EXTREMELY helpful and understanding, knows more information than I thought possible, no matter what you present on he knows something about it, grade consists of two 3 page papers, a 5 page one, a VERY easy presentation on anything, and a midterm and a final. If you are looking for a night class that lets out early though keep looking.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2006<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty much what the person below said. Prof is a little nutty, but wants people to absorb and understand the info. There's a lot of significant historical things that he accounts that you have never heard of (for real). You have to do a presentation, but it's nothing to be scared about. Its funny watching him use the projector or tv. Good dude</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably one the easiest classes I've ever taken. He uses the whole time to teach so if you want to get out of a night class early this is not it. Very good at what he does and is extremely fair and helps you a lot if your in trouble.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2005<br>Class Name: FCH397<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Suozzo is one of my favorites. His MOLIERE class was really fine. Suozzo knows so much about 17th century France that you come away having learned a lot! However, he expects you to function at a certain level - don't dissapoint him! If you make the effort and listen to the guy CLOSELY then his classes will be some of the best to be had here. Great!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2005<br>Class Name: FCH203<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a really animated guy. Doesn't check homework. Tests aren't that bad. Overall a great guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2005<br>Class Name: ISPSOPHSEM<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a great guy!  He is clear with what he wants from you in class and his tests really are not that difficult.  If you do the readings and come to lectures you will do awesome.  He has the greatest sense of humor and the best part of his class are his tangents.  he is such a cute little man!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2005<br>Class Name: FCH201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a really nice fair professor. As long as you participate and show you're making an effort you'll get a good grade. He does tend to go off on tangents sometimes but that's not really a bad thing!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2005<br>Class Name: ISPSOPHSEM<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just about the cutest little man ever.  Loved the class, a fascinating side of history you very rarely get to see (Gay/Lesbian America circa 1920-present).  Mine is a night class, so it tends to run long, but he is a fun, interesting man, & a pretty easy grader (so far).  Would definitely recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2004<br>Class Name: FCH201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice, wants you to get the most from his class, and tries his hardest to help you succeed.  Overall he is just a great person to learn from.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2004<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i like the marathon class he taught.  it was a lot of lectures from people working in the marathon. there were 4 papers a midterm and a final.they were all easy if you came to class for all the lectures and read the book and actually put forth some effort</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2004<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2004<br>Class Name: ISP211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice professor - very passionate, wants you to learn, fair grader, medium difficulty readings</div></div></div></body></html>
