As it was a seminar class, I talked way more than I would have in any other class. We talked about a lot of interesting topics in the news, even controversial topics that could be thought of as not so PC. She's super knowledgable and is available to help students, and responds to emails quickly. Would take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2015<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Dr T was one of the best professors I have had at DePaul. She is passionate and very intelligent. I took two classes with her and plan on taking many more that she is teaching. She is helpful, funny and is very determined to teach students all she knows. love her!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2015<br>Class Name: LSP121LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor that I have ever taken at DePaul. I plan to take every class she offers. Extremely helpful, passionate, and knowledgeable. Fantastic LSP 121 professor because she makes assignments easier. I took my FP with her and she's extremely passionate & unbiased teaching Nuclear Waste which rubs off on the student in a very positive way!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2014<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While she is willing to give help, she doesn't seem to know what she is doing half of the time. The TA is the one who actually helped whenever I had a question. Everything in the class is done in pairsgroups, except for homework. At least 2 or 3 assignments per week. She made an already awful class that much worse.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2014<br>Class Name: LSP112223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm surprised by some of the negativity on here. Professor Tzoumis is  very insightful and knowledgeable in environmental public policy. She's extremely nice, and it's very clear and straight forward course. Don't let the essays discourage you. There are only two really big papers .The only tough part is reading legislation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2012<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible. Assigns far too much work, especially for a freshman class. &quot;simulations&quot; are impossible for some students to prepare for depending on the &quot;role&quot; they were given. This class was literally 10 times harder than all of my others combined. Stay away. Far away.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2011<br>Class Name: PPS300<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Completely useless class and way too many long BS assignments...reflections are 4 pages single spaced and all about the same frickin thing!

She is very very experience in her field. I thought this class was a class I would dread about,but this class really opened my eyes. Just do the work and this class will be an easy A. After taking this class, I am now thinking about double majoring with public policy now.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2010<br>Class Name: PPS331<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I absolutely love this professor. She is the one who convinced me to add a minor in Public Policy and I am so glad I did. Although we have three novels and a handful of other documents to read, they are all very interesting and easy to get through. The papers are long but straighforward. I highly recommend taking her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2009<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Completely unclear. Makes up her own citation style for the essays with almost no explanation, and then tells me something I've done with it for EVERY draft I submit. Why not just tell me all at once&#63; Lies to the class and tells us that ALL of the freshman focal point classes have to do two 15-page papers. Completely unclear on everything.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/11/2008<br>Class Name: PPS202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has the most annoying laugh ever. I thought I would rip out my hair after a week. Other than this, she isn't too bad but she's not the greatest teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2007<br>Class Name: PPS331<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible teacher, made a mandatory saturday meeting then changed it at the last minute without informing the class, does not respond to emails. Kept changing the syllabus.  AVOID!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2007<br>Class Name: PPS202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's very biased with her grades.  The class is based off of 2 small papers and 2 group projects.  Nothing was very hard to finish, but she marks off hard for minor things.  Her grading scale is different - the A range is 94 - 100.  So my 93 was considered a B, which I find unreasonable.  Sit in the front, act interested and you'll do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2007<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i give her credit for trying to teach something that no one really cares about, but there are three 10 page papers thats pretty much it...she's alright</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2007<br>Class Name: PPS204<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher I have had at DePaul. She is very confusing and her class is 90% power point and reading...though if you skipped her lectures you'd learn a lot more than you do listening to her. She has a way of making easy concepts seem very complicated.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2006<br>Class Name: PPS204<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>In awe of her high marks as at this site.  Definitely doesn't reflect the students' sentiments in the class I had with her.  I suspect she posts positive comments about her classes.  Wretched teacher and painfully boring.  PPS students have to take her.  Has a big ego that is easy to play to.  Easy A if feign respect and admiration.  Expect PTSD.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2006<br>Class Name: PPS204<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ugh. Not only did we have to sit through three weeks of our classmates presentations (all went WAY over time) but there are a number of little habies the professor has that are SO annoying. Like repeating everything seven times. Also, her emails are very difficult to decipher because she's not familiar with the concept of full sentences.  BOO!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/17/2006<br>Class Name: PPS202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The sad thing is I reaaaaally like the Professor because she is a great lecturer, but reeeeeaaally despise her course(s) because they have a ridiculous work-load!  Rahter than understand the 10-week limitation, she tries to cram it all in!  I hear PPS 204 is no better in this regard.  Helpful, but unrealistic.  Double-edged sword for sure.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2006<br>Class Name: PSC224<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was ridiculous. So many people ended up dropping. It was so hard to make myself go to class, and I hardly ever miss class. We had an annoying project that took up soooooo much time, and it was so stupid. The subject is dry and boring also. Don't recommend the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2006<br>Class Name: PSC224<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes very querky and passionate about the rulemaking, and assigned work and she was really  doing research on, basically getting free work out of the students.  Work load terrible, and grading is crazy.

She plays favorites and not everyone gets a chance to speak because nobody raises their hands. Thus the loudest person gets heard. She is very demanding, you can't miss 1 class (even though she has gotten sick and taken time off, it suddenly becomes a group work day). She expects her class to be your only class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2005<br>Class Name: PPS340<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She expects her class to be your only priority. She expects you not miss even one class. She is not clear about how she wants you to write even though you know the MLA standards, she even critiques the Biblio (even though she may be wrong at least according to the MLA). All we learned about was the group project.  She is BORING.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/12/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She didn't give me a B, because of ONE point!

Totally scatterbrained, always came to class late, and not very helpful with the ISP 120 material.  Completely condescending! Jim, her assistant, basically taught the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2005<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A little weird, but she knows the subject from both a theoretical and practical pt of view (she worked on capital hill)  Sometimes class seems like grade school,also completely misuses the internet and powerpoint,otherwise good teacher,fair,good conv in class-lets you say anything</div></div></div></body></html>
