The class itself is not something I would recommend. He is a nice fellow for sure, but is so dull, I am put to sleep every time. If you must take this class, it is not horrid, but if avoidable, you will have more fun elsewhere.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2015<br>Class Name: SOC394<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The texts are very detailed and if you don't remember particular quotes for the multiple choice midterm, you will not do well. Lectures are insanely boring and off track. He has awesome handwriting on the board- that's the best thing I can say about this fellow. Avoid at all costs.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2015<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher has been offensive from the first day of class. He has made off-the-cuff comments in class to the point where I and a friend of mine had to walk out. His readings are equally offensive. DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. I have never been more offended by a class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2015<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Very unclear. Talks super quiet, and expects you to come closer instead of him talking louder. Most of the Explore Chicago class was spent roaming around random parts of Chicago that had NOTHING to do with our readings purpose of the class. He's also super disorganized.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2015<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>He is so unclear when lecturing about the topic for the day. I didn't pay attention throughout class because when he would lecture it was always off topic and made no sense. When it came to taking the tests I got a B+ and an A and I never paid attention to the lectures just read little bits of the books.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2014<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>His lectures are unusual but very interesting and I find him pretty engaging. He's also very strict though, quiz every week. There's not a lot of assignments, but if you don't do the reading every week you will fail the class. I did the reading, didn't study for the final and still aced the test so basically if you read you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2014<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Quiz every class, but this is the only thing in class that will feel slightly relevant to material. Practically no feedback on work. Very unclear about what to expect. "Test on everything we have learned so far" is not helping anyone. Neither are his dry ramblings that never seem to have a point to take away. Rely heavily on readings to learn.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2014<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Barker is my favorite professor at Depaul hands down! He is great at what he does, very smart but kind of dry. I love the readings you do for this course. He tells great stories that relate to what we are learning, it's like having your grandpa tell you entertaining stories from the past! Take this class if you want to be amazing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2014<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher of all time. The exact opposite of helpful and definitely not just a waste of a time but a waste of money on the books. Horrible teacher, and just a weird guy who doesn't have a damn relevant thing to say. Not that I'm only angry about the time wasted but the ridiculous quizzes with irrelevant topics</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2013<br>Class Name: SOC214<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was a waste of time. Quizzes every class and he asks the most insignificant details about the reading. No feedback on assignments. Ridiculous multiple choice midterm & final. He gets on huge tangents and all examples, videos, and readings are DECADES out of date. None of his materials were relevant, helpful, or current. Do not take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2013<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are looking to learn anything about sociology, this class is not for you. To be frank, Prof. Barker is a terrible teacher. Every single class period is wasted discussing trivial, irrelevant topics. However, if you are looking for an easy A, just do the reading and you should be fine. This class was an immense disappointment.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/31/2013<br>Class Name: SOC214<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For each class he gives a test based on the readings. Midterm and final had about 80 multiple choice questions which was a bit difficult because its hard to remember 6-7 chapters without a guideline or something to focus on. And so he curves both tests. He shows a lot of videos. And he is a big talker, he can talk your ear off to like death.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2013<br>Class Name: SOC220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took three classes with Prof. Barker- and he is the favorite professor I've had even through my PhD coursework. It's college- you should be expected to work hard, and he expects college level work. He is a bit odd, but brilliant and also wonderful outside of class. Any issues, just email- he is a reasonable person. He is fantastic.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2013<br>Class Name: SOC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took him twice for two separate classes. i found the class easy. You have daily quizzes which is basically your attendance. Your midterm and final come exactly from your reading material. Just read, show up, and you will get an A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2013<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had professor barker as a Freshman for Explore Chicago (Crime/Business/Politics in Chicago). BARKER WAS THE BEST!!! Class is nothing but field trips! You go to many cool places! Weekly reading assigned, but it's short and simple! Quiz each week. Midterm/final are doable. Final paper as well....super easy; you just write about memories. TAKE HIM!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2012<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Barker is nice.

I've taken several of his classes and it's the only class I've ever really enjoyed going to.

He gave no direction at all and no one in class ever paid attention because his lectures sucked. I retained no information that I needed for the tests from him. He lectures about things that had nothing to do with sociology. This class ruined my GPA. It was horrible! STAY AWAY!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2011<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was my first class at DePaul and it was the worst thing I have every experienced. Noel Barker has no structure to his lecturing, no notes, no study guide. Daily quizzes, and you don't find out your grade until the day before the final. Worst class in the entire world!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2011<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At first I thought that this class was going to be boring, which I have to admit that it is at times, but his lectures are pretty interesting when you get the hang of it.  You have to take daily quizzes, but they are not that hard.

Make sure you read because there are daily quizzes about the readings BUT the readings are super interesting!

He just stands up there and talks to himself, wincing as tho he has heartburn. Dont sit in the back or you wont be able to hear him. His daily quizzes ask very specific questions from the readings. However, he does have a curve so as long as you get half the questions right, you should have at least a C.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2010<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gives quizzes every day which are ridiculous.

Easy A! Okay sometimes he can be a little bit boring, but if you participate in class it won't be. The books he picks are good reads. 25hrs of service learning is easy! If you have the option of picking Central States SER, pick the 76th and Kostner location. One question quizzes (super easy!)is his way of taking attendance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2010<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teerrrrrriblllllee!!!!! he is the worst. my whole class scored terribly on every quiz we took. yes, he curves them, but if u want better than a C in the class GOODLUCK. dont do it he is boring too!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2010<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a fantastic teacher, very passionate about his subject and seemed to have a wealth of experience to draw from in lectures.

No basis in sociological theory - we watch videos all the  time.  15 quizzes and a mid-term so far and we have received nothing back - almost the end of the quarter.  Boring, uninteresting, a waster of time as well as frustrating for someone who takes school seriously. Don't waste your tuition!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2009<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Barker is great. His lectures can be a bit boring, but most of the time he keeps students engaged with funny/interesting stories and facts. He knows his stuff.

I am a straight A student who got a C+ in this class! The books were interesting, but lecture was extremely mind numbing. He picks random facts from the three books and that is the midterm/final.

I hated reading the material, only to go to class to hear him tell me what I just read. Thanks, but no thanks. I'm here to work and read,; the teacher should be here to challenge me and make me think about what I read, not waste my time. Very lenient with grades.

Very funny and interesting. Worth going to class. A little slow on getting papers/tests back (up to weeks after you took the tests) and you never get quizzes back.
