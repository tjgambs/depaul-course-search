I was not accustomed to only reading and not doing much homework along the way. So the key to success in this class is to read every chapter assigned and to not procrastinate (obviously). Storey is a great professor and really knows the material like the back of her hand.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Storey loves her job. She really knows the material and expect the students to spend a lot of time reading to get the most out of the course. Students are expected to complete weekly reading prompts on the assigned material and the writings will affect your grade. no final or midterm. Do not skip the readings. Easily my favorite class at DePaul</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2014<br>Class Name: HST182<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>If she didn't treat this level 100 class like it was a 200 level or 300 level, out-of-class work wise, I would've loved this professor. This class is usually just something history majors use to fill their requirements, and she needs to realize that and not take it so seriously</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200902<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Storey is an amazing professor who really enjoys teaching and engaging with her students.

I learned a lot of tools and hints and ways to analyze that I know will aid me in the rest of my historical work. I highly recommend her. She is certainly one of the best professors at DePaul and she clearly cares about every student's success. Take her for every class possible!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2013<br>Class Name: HST373<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Storey is one of my favorite professors at DePaul. As long as you do the reading, she is super nice and helpful. She's incredibly knowledgable and an interesting lecturer.

This was the coolest sophomore seminar ever! Professor Storey knows what she is talking about. She's a great professor, best class at DePaul so far. I wish she taught every class. She expects a lot, but that only makes class better. Don't take her class if you aren't willing to do the work. Highly recommend her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best courses I will ever take thanks to Storey. She has high expectations, but that only pushed my entire class to be great. She knows what she is talking about and she loves what she is talking about. Extremely approachable and genuinely wants her students to succeed. A lot of writing and reading, but my analysis skills deeply improved.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Storey went above and beyond previous professors I thought were the best. She is highly educated and passionate about the Old South. She sets high standards and clear requirements but this lead to having the best class in terms of discussion from my peers. I would recommend her to anyone who wants to do the work and face America's actual past</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2012<br>Class Name: HST379<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing scholar.  Hard to please.  Must know reading material like the back of your hand.  Avoid if you have a busy lifestyle/have a job/have a family  because it will be difficult, doable, but difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2011<br>Class Name: HST182<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. So sharp! Knows exactly what she's talking about. One of the few teachers I've truly learned from at DePaul.  Structured course, daily readings/quizzes. Silence your phone and shut up in class - she calls disrespectful people out. I hated history classes my whole life, but she captivated my interest. THAT is a good teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/11/2011<br>Class Name: HIST298<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very good professor. There is ALOT of reading and some assignments do take a lot of time but in the end it all benefits you and your learning. Some material might be hard to understand but she always makes herself available to help. She is one of the best professors i have had at Depaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2010<br>Class Name: HIST373<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Storey had moments which can at best be described as unprofessional, and at worst over-emotional. Her maditory whole-class participation caused dragging class discussion. Her repeated outbursts towards students either unprepared or uninterested added another element of discration from the class. I enjoy her as a scholar, just wish she would  relax.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2009<br>Class Name: HST298<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's really helpful.  If you do ABSOLUTELY all the reading for this class, you'll gain a lot from it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2009<br>Class Name: HST298<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nothing sems to be good enough for this professor.

She is incredibly on top of her game and very sharp. If you don't do your work, she WILL call you out on it! There is a lot of reading and lots of assignments, but as long as you keep on top of it all, you will do fine. She is always avalable for extra help and is dedicated to making you learn the material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Storey is a fabulous teacher! She will make you think and challenge those critical thinking skills. There is A LOT of reading, but all of it important to the class. If you don't mind working for your grade, you won't regret taking her class. I am def. taking more classes with Prof. Storey</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2008<br>Class Name: HIST421<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2007<br>Class Name: HST379<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Storey is a wonderfully nice person and professor.

She is an intelligent teacher who makes her students work hard, but she is always willing to work out conflicts or to meet with students to discuss their papers. I learned a ton about historical methods and I'll always be grateful to her for encouraging that spark of interest in history. Lots of reading, just keep on top of it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Country lady, has an accent. Annoying. She's a real **** and very rude. Don't be late, ALWAYS do the readings and homework or she will humiliate you to the fullest of her power.  Don't take her if you're shy or quiet.  She's mean, blunt, and doesn't care about her students learning as a group.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/28/2006<br>Class Name: HST372<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Perhaps one of the best teachers I've ever had!  You will work very hard for your grade but you will leave at the end of the quarter knowing that you learned something.  Come to class prepared: bring the book, know what you've read and be ready to discuss.  If you don't, you'll be shown the door.  Nice, but doesn't tolerate fools gladly!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2006<br>Class Name: HST<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is as rock star!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2006<br>Class Name: HST372<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very intelligent, expects a lot out of her students. If students are unprepared for class (warning: a lot of reading, though all relevant and mostly interesting) she's disappointed. She truly expects students to excell and when they don't, she tries to help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2006<br>Class Name: HST372<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2005<br>Class Name: HST199<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was one of the most demanding classes I have ever taken as a student. Professor Storey is very helpful and pushes her students to work harder and to look at their sources through many different angles. She is not easy, but after taking her class, you feel as though you can ace any class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher. Show up to class as much as you can, but attendance is not neccessary. If you miss class stay in touch with her through email. She honestly just wants you to care abotu the class. Do that and youll be fine. Also do the readings. A bunch of idiots would just sit there and let the people that read talk. She totaly knew. They failed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2005<br>Class Name: HST199<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Storey is extremely helpful and an excellent teacher, class was a lot of work but if you don't fall behind it isn't too bad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2005<br>Class Name: HST199<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was by far the hardest course I've taken at DePaul. There is a ton of reading (which isn't discussed to the extent I would expect for the hours of reading). This class isn't for the faint of heart. I'd say my class lost 2 people / week as they dropped out due to the course load. My advice, don't miss class, and speak up. This will win her over</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took Sohp Sem. Jim Crow Laws ... A lot of reading but mostly nonfiction 7th grade novels. All classes are discussion, they are interesting and helpful. Prof INCREDIBLY knowledgable and teaches well. Grades papers hard, you have to work for her class. She seems scary but is very nice, just do your work!! You will learn a lot, worth it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of reading.  Take this class if you have about 8 hours free to read for 3 days.  Interesting teacher, she has a cute southern accent and she is also nice.

She doesn't tolerate disruptions and makes that very clear the first day.  Don't take her for an easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/09/2005<br>Class Name: HST199<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One word to describe this lady.

She is quite anal and can be very rude if you aren't on her good side.

She expects you to put in ridiculous amount of hours into reading and assignments. Will belittle and humiliate you whenever she can (esp. if you don't do the reading).

If you don't really like history and have to take it...make sure it is with her.  She makes history fun and her lectures are easy to listen to. She isn't a tough grader.

She comes off hard, b/c she is! But you'll learn to love her ways and she is very helpful. Willing to meet with students, and really wants to see you do well.
