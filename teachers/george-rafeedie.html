Take him for your intro class, but i wouldn't reccomend him any further.  He seems to have been in the industry for a while, but didn't go into detail about many things.  He makes you go into team and come up with PR strategies which was good for us.  Not much HW, class work, or any work really.  Easy A. Cool dude</div></div></div></body></html>
