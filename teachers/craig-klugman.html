Yes attendance is mandatory, but you wont want to miss class. He makes medical ethics much more approachable& comfortable. Communication is key, and as long as you email him, he'll appreciate you much more I believe.

He was very knowledgeable about just about any health related topic and could elaborate in language that was easy for students to follow. Very helpful, approachable and clear. I would highly recommend taking a class with him. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/29/2014<br>Class Name: NURS4012<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy!

However, Dr. Klugman isn't very clear about project/papers. There is no text book so it seems like the class is not structured. He is very helpful, just ask if you have any questions. There are very few assignments and the midterm and the final make up most of your grade.</div></div></div></body></html>
