Definitely recommend her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2014<br>Class Name: PRAD396<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Took my Senior Capstone class with Jill. She's a wonderful instructor, and person in general. The class on the other hand was a bit of an (easy) dud. Didn't really learn a whole lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2014<br>Class Name: PRAD255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is super helpful, very clear when teaching and is always on time. We had attendance but she was understanding with how harsh this winter was if we e-mailed her prior that we could not attend. The work load was fair and she definitely helped me better understand the many areas public relations professionals work in!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2013<br>Class Name: PRAD256<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is definitely one of the best professor at DePaul.
