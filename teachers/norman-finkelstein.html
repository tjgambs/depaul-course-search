Most of the negative comments here are posted by people who aren't his students, he actually never lectures about the topics he's known for in class.

He appears to open the dialogue to opposite points of view but, when he disagrees with you, he is prone to subtly reminding you that you, as a student, are subject to his final grade.

He doesn't want you to be a drone which is why he'll provoke you, he wants you to be able to think independantly. I certainly learned something.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2006<br>Class Name: LOTSOFPSCS<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Finkelstein IS a great professor.
