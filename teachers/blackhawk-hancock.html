He knows his stuff but more often than not is unwilling to teach. He kicked the class out 5 different times. He seems to have a fairly serious anger problem.

I've learned so much from him. The readings are interesting (and required). Only one final paper and participation are your grade. Come prepared to talk. My only issue with him is his mood and attitude. If he's having a bad day, he takes it out on the class. Beware of his pessimism and mood swings</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2012<br>Class Name: SOC405<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a wonderful teacher! I am part of the learning disability program at DePaul and he has been more then helpful when it comes to accommodations. I highly recommend him.

No cellphone or laptop use in class but this forces you whiny undergrads to pay attention. Be prepared to say what you think... but make sure you think before you say it.  The readings are WORTH reading and what you take away from the course (as well as how much you enjoy it) will reflect what you put in.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2010<br>Class Name: SOC465<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I learned a lot from this cat.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2010<br>Class Name: SOC405<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very intelligent, eccentric,& funny often.Ive taken him for a #of classes as an undergrad & grad student. I dont think he cares for undergrad classes much because they tend to not take the subject matter seriously. Grad courses he lectures the full time & actually tries to teach you.

Def. does not care about students and lets you know it. Hes somewhat entertaining with a hint of scary. The class was easy and he doesnt expect much of you except for a long paper at the end of class, but he is not a hard grader. Makes you buy at least 6 or 7 books that you dont really have to read.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2008<br>Class Name: SOC331<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's kind of odd, but he's pretty cool.  Attendance isn't completely mandatory and you don't need to really read all of the books.  There is a 15 page paper due at the end of the quarter and that's pretty much it.  He can be funny too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2008<br>Class Name: SOC355<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>if you show up and turn in a paper you will pass the class. i didnt even read the books and turned in a 9 page paper that had to be 15 pages and still passed. he comes off as really serious, but he's not that bad of a guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2008<br>Class Name: THEORY<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>students either hate or love this guy. if you want a fairly easy class with a professor who tells you like it is, this is your guy. if you want the teacher to mouth feed you your education....not him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2007<br>Class Name: SOC280<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's definitely weird, but it's an easy class. you don't have to really show up, minimal use of the (confusing) books he had us read on Lacan.

Blackhawk really is something.  It is so interesting to go to his class, since he really doesn't know if he is awake or dreaming, or what is real etc...  He once taught us ow to make &quot;real&quot; martinis and I had some grade A quotes by him.  ex. &quot;Look forward to a life of therapy&quot;.

Had him for a night class and we never stayed more than an hour and a half.  I got an A because I doubt he ever graded anyone all quarter. Class participation and final paper are the only grades. I guess he's good for commerce students looking for an easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2007<br>Class Name: SOC405<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy doesn't make any sense at all.

The books never came in until like Week 5, so we had to rely on lecture for the most part, but his intention was for us to read ourselves and come for discussion.
