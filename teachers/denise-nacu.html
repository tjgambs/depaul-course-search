She is very passionate about her field and wants her students to succeed.  With the 10 week course, I just find it to be too much work.  Group project, quizzes, IRB Training, and a final exam.  I feel it is all great experience, however it may have been too much within the 10 week span.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2015<br>Class Name: ISM220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's great. Two quizzes, no tests, and one large group project split into 4 parts.  If you do the work you'll get the credit, it was pretty clear cut.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2012<br>Class Name: ISM210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sweetest lady ever and a great professor.
