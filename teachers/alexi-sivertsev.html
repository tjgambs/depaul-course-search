It was more of a history class with one topic. Tests are super hard but he gives you two chances, including the final. Assigns 3 three-page papers and only gives two days to do the discussions. Chapters are very long and take forever to read. Very picky grader. Expect to work hard for a decent grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2012<br>Class Name: REL109<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took the online section, and it was just alright. You have to watch several lecturettes a week, read 20-40 pages from the text a week, take a weekly quiz, and post a weekly discussion response, while responding to two other students discussion. He's a very stingy grader the 3 papers. Overall, this class was a lot of work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2011<br>Class Name: REL109<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Sivertsev is a wonderful professor! Sure, his lectures are lengthy, but it isn't easy providing students with a full history of Judaism in just 10 weeks. He is an extremely intelligent and interesting person. Those who are looking for a blow-off class that still provide them with an A will obviously not enjoy his classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2011<br>Class Name: REL109<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly, hard class. three two pages paper. mid term and final. grade is very strict. boring class. just write every single words he said, you will pass. don't expect an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2011<br>Class Name: HIST109<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. 3 2 page papers, midterm and take home final.

Boring, hard to understand, acts as if you understand everything that he's talking about, hard grader, assigns massive amounts of reading (which im not sure if he's serious about yet).
