The campaign is worth 50% of your grade so do not wait unitl the last minute and make sure your team works together on most aspects!  I did well in this class and I think she is a fine teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2007<br>Class Name: CMN375<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's a very difficult class (AP for juniors and seniors) and I am a freshman who took it. I loved it, though. You have to do one presentation of a case brief and a HUGE group argument project. You have to write a 10-12 pg paper and have a 10-12 minute oral argument. It's hard but fun. She's a great professor and provides helpful notes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2006<br>Class Name: CMN575<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't think she likes students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/12/2006<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>plays favorites and even when i asked her for help, i was referred to the t.a. while other students got one-on-one time with her.  she took off points on a final project and said certain things were left out although they were clearly presented.  unless you're ready to kiss ass, i wouldn't recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2006<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Fitzpatrick was a GREAT professor.  I don't know what the person below is talking about.  She gives clear expectations and rewards you if you meet them. She is energetic and interesting and is DEFINITELY a professor you need to take before you leave!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2006<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AMAZING!!! Loved the class, loved the teacher. The workload was acceptable, and she was more than willing to take time after class to help out. HIGHLY recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2006<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher didn't understand that this was a freshmen class, she picks favorites and is a really hard grader as well as doesn't give you criteria for how she grades papers.  She sucks, take her if you want to get a bad grade and be annoyed for 10 weeks.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2005<br>Class Name: CMN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Fitzpatrick is an incredibly intelligent, dynamic woman but the classes tended to drag on a bit. The organization of the course would be better suited if it had more discussion rather than just lecture.  Throwing in some TV/film/print examples would be helpful too.  She is hard but fair- work hard and you'll hvae no problem!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2005<br>Class Name: CMN555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's nice, but in this class she talks a lot.
