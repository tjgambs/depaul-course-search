She is not the easiest professor but if you work hard, her class will be very rewarding. She would go out of her ways to help you out, so email her when things starts getting confusing and you'll do fine. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2014<br>Class Name: CSC243<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Respect her academic Integrity Pledge! Yes, unlike most professors she does check Stack Overflow, and does catch plagiarism. Good professor who makes you think with assignments, and makes you learn the language, and the surrounding 'ideas' behind it. Take her if you actually want to learn, not have the language fed to you. Isn't that hard though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2014<br>Class Name: CSC243<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: Rather not say</div><div id="right"><div>Oh well. i had to drop her class. the reason is that if you work on a project you can work together up to 3 people. But in any case the second or third person gives hisher work to 4th person than automatically the first person did plagiarism even if you did not know about it. and 4th person is safe BIG TIME. NEVER TAKE HER  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2014<br>Class Name: CSC242<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible. I'm a CS nerd but still she ruined this class. She has no idea how abrasive her personality is. She said once her own lowest grades were in CS classes. Well, it shows. Poor teacher with a bitter attitude.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/07/2014<br>Class Name: CSC242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall great class, lectures are always relevant to the assignments and tests. If you need help it's unreal how fast Amber will respond to an email. Take this course if you're willing to work hard and want to learn. Otherwise, if you're looking for an easy A don't take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2014<br>Class Name: CSC242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor! Explains everything and answers any questions you have thoroughly. Attendance was mandatory for lecture and lab. 1 programming assignment due almost every week which were very similar to the problems we did during lecture and lab. Allowed to bring like ten pages of notes to the midterm and final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2014<br>Class Name: CSC242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amber Settle had to take over our CSC242 course halfway through the quarter.  She should be commended for the way she handled it.  A very engaging and clear instructor, who knows her stuff.  She even learned our names in that short timeframe.  I would take another course with her without hesitation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2014<br>Class Name: CSC242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Upper echelon professor.  We focused quite a bit on recursion, which can be difficult for a beginner, but that's how you learn.  I am heading into my senior year and Settle is still my favorite.  Extraordinarily helpful, good lectures, and never seems to miss a beat.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/21/2014<br>Class Name: CSC242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Settle is a really nice lady. She'll answer her email ASAP, faster than any professor at Depaul. That's the possible. Majority of my classmates dropped the class, including myself by week 5. I had no idea what was happening. All my classmates were in the tutoring center getting help. Retaking CSC242 with Perkovic, much better teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/03/2013<br>Class Name: CSC242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>if you didnt do so well in 241 or dont get python all that well she is not the teacher for you. she is willing to help but she covers a lot in a short time. 242 is 3x harder than 241. by week 2 our class went from 25 down to 12. and the midterm/final add up to 70% of your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2013<br>Class Name: CSC242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Settle is very good at what she does. Her lectures are very informative and she makes the homework very clear on what she's looking for in particular. Settle is also spot on with communication outside of class. The class was most certainly not easy, but with enough practice, dedication and frequent emailing, it's not bad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2012<br>Class Name: CSC242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best instructors I've had as a CDM student at DePaul.  Keeps class entertaining, quickly responds to e-mail, has an exceptional understanding of course content, very helpful, actually teaches useful things.  Highly recommended.  Homework does require actual work, and subject matter can be difficult if it's not your thing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2012<br>Class Name: CSC241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Settle is the best teacher I've had at DePaul so far. She is incredibly responsive and helpful via email. She explains everything she expects from you clearly. I never felt like anything was unfair in her class. Good sense of humor, likes to make class fun when possible. I would take her for every CS class if I could.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2012<br>Class Name: CSC241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome Teacher, pretty easy and very helpful when you ask questions via email, etc. Very fun and can be a very relaxed class if you get to know her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2011<br>Class Name: CSC240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty good teacher.

SHE IS EXTREMELY HELPFUL INSIDE/OUTSIDE CLASS, RESPONDS TO E-MAILS VERY QUICKLY, AND ENCOURAGES STUDENTS TO ASK FOR HER HELP. in this class, all what you need to get A is &quot;READ,DO HOMEWORK, and ASK her for help&quot;.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2011<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worest teacher i ever had she is hard on  grading and she isnt helpful.

She gave way too much reading and our quizzes were random/small details. She despises cheating, so if you plan to, don't take her class! The trips taken were long and boring but great for bonding with people in your class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2010<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class. Field trips were not terrible and you get free food. Reading questions every week that are easy because answers are directly from the book. Final project is super easy and free food last class.

Super organized, crystal clear in terms of notes and explaining concepts. I'm not an online student, but I've watched lectures online and she's great about ensuring clarity for online students. Excellent at responding to e-mails. If you're taking CSC-202, I highly recommend Dr. Settle. (She's very nice too!)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2010<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely helpful and clear in direction and instruction.

Make sure to attend class; in-class activities are a pretty significant portion of your grade.
