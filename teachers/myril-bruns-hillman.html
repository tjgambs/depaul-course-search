I don't think she even has a scale, she just randomly assigns grades as she feels between B's and C's. Take someone else and save yourself the headache.  She says that 80% is an A- but that's not true at all. I had about an 85% average and she gave me a B-. Avoid. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2014<br>Class Name: MKT305<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Hillman is great! She is extremely nice and charismatic. She really enjoys teaching and will make herself available to help you at any time. Lectures get a bit draggy, but overall knows the industry and the skills very well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2013<br>Class Name: MKT305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>This may have been 1 of the most boring classes I have had. She is a nice professor & has a lot of real world stories, but she skims over everything she teaches, & it's all done in her monotone voice. You need to read the book if you want to learn. She curves tests. I would have failed if she hadn't. There is a midterm, final, & group presentation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2009<br>Class Name: MKT202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>read the book and the test will be a breeze. homework assignments are easy and ms hillman is  easy going. she tries to be funny. but it works.</div></div></div></body></html>
