She is quirky and a little ditzy sometimes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2015<br>Class Name: DISCOVER<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was probably the rudest person I've ever met.

I've taken her for two different classes and I learned so much from each. She does assign more work than the average professor, but she gives good feedback and doesn't give you more than you can handle. She's very down to earth and funny. She will really help your writing. Take her class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2014<br>Class Name: CHICAGOLIT<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Salli is an interesting prof-she assigns wonderful readings and usually engages the class in good discussions. However, she assigns a silly amount of busy work throughout the quarter, which is irritating. She can be very kind and insightful, yet at other times she would be very short-tempered and even rude. She is quirky, most definitely, but cool.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher. She assigns a lot of pointless papers on pointless topics & weird or pointless readings. She is not open minded at all. If she doesn't like your opinion on something she will give you a bad grade. Her comments are borderline rude. She doesn't post grades on D2L or pass back assignments. You never know your grade or how to improve.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2012<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is a lot of reading and a lot of homework for this class, be warned! She also makes you buy A TON of books. She is nice enough, but she can be a bit nuerotic at times. She has passion for the content, but she gets really nit picky about things which is annoying.She also makes you print out everything, so make sure you are prepared for class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The Professor is over the top in terms of personality. There's a lot of work for this class and almost every week there some sort of work to be turned in. Usually we go through 6 drafts just for a lame essay about what we like. All of the essays are pointless and from the class, I learned very little.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2010<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Salli was super helpful inside and outside the class with recommendations for further reading, etc.  The work was average and there was a lot of reading.  You're pretty much expected to talk about the reading, too, so go prepared.  Ooh, she also accepts late work, which is a huge bonus.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2010<br>Class Name: WRD102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>True, homework was minimal, but when doing drafts...be prepared to print out A LOT of copies.

Other than that... pretty good class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2010<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know why she has such bad reviews. I love Salli, and so did everyone in my class! Sure, there were a lot of readings, but what do you expect&#63; You signed up for a class called &quot;Contemporary Literature in Chicago,&quot; duh. The readings are interesting and immersion week was a blast. Definitely recommended. :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She should probably get that attitude checked. I hated going to that class, she was mean! but it was very easy for 104.. only 3 short papers all on the same person and i used the same 5 sources for all of them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have never disliked someone more.

The actual immersion week was interesting, but we always had an overload of readings. The rest of the quarter had too many readings as well. The class discussions were pretty boring because no one could get into any of the lit because there was too much. She is a little understanding.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>salli means well but fails miserably at her job.she is one of the worst prof i have ever had. i dreaded going to class because its all busy work and stupid conversation. She is very close minded. You HAVE to conform to her style of writing to do well. You almost feel like your constantly being parented and begged to participate.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She drove me absolutely crazy. I do not appreciate being treated like a 12-year-old, and I do not understand why she thinks it is appropriate to treat college students as such. I dropped the class three weeks in simply because I could not deal with her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I honestly cannot see how Berg Seeley has received any positive reviews. She. Doesn't. Teach. She is not a teacher in any sense of the word. I've learned absolutely nothing from her. She 's a professional time-waster. She kills an hour and half with useless conversation, and then  you leave dumber than before.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2008<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved going to this class.

Also, it was a bit hard to keep track of the deadlines, because the syllabus kept changing and was disorganized.  It really felt like papers were do every week (for the night class).  I wouldn't say she's awful, but I'm not actively seeking her out.  I put in mediocre effort and got a B+.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2007<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is awesome! She has a lot of office hours outside of class and she'll read your essay before it's due. She is also very understanding and even cancelled class when we suggested it! Three essays on one person, kind of a lot of work, but you can pick someone youre interested in so it's fun.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2007<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty lenient with when things are due.

Of course there will be a lot of reading and writing -- it is an English class. I thought she was very helpful and gives ample opportunities to succeed in her class.

She is very unclear on her homework assignments and gives a lot of homework everyday.  Most of the time you will have to redo the assignments because she does not explain them well.  Also, she thinks everyone's opinion makes no sense, and she gives a wierd look when you comment on the readings.  Avoid taking this teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher assigns WAYYY too much homework.

Often the assignments are unclear and you end up having to rewrite your paper.  Not a bad personality, but she grades hard and never gives you a break on homework.  On days she has Jewish holidays she assigns extra work which I found stupid and unfair.  Avoid unless you love homework.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2005<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is very hard too much work, too much hw. you will get hw every day. very hard correction. she will get your mind cazy.you need to spend atlease 15 hour in a week to do her work. i am seniour, i really know how to to write but she still gien me a bad grade. lot to read. if you really like to get screwed your self take her. warning do not take he</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2005<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher seriously Sucks at life! She should not be teaching as a professor at this university. She is unorganized and not helpful.
