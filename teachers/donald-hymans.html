When he gives lectures, he is very precise and very good at analyzing each piece we look at. However, he is not very helpful in terms of helping us improve as writers. He is so specific on some of his prompts that it is difficult to write the required 5 pages. Luckily, he is an easy grader</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a good teacher with a good background in the writing field as a publisher.  He provided very helpful comments for all of the essays.  Some people had trouble understanding exactly what he wanted out of assignments at times but I always understood what he was looking for</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really easy grader. we get a lot of chances to revise our work. The only complaint I have about him is how he does notes, theyre really confusing. I stopped trying to take notes and just used the book which was really helpful. He let us have laptops too which was awesome. He is accepting of late work and understanding of computer problems.</div></div></div></body></html>
