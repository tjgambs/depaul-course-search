The issue is when it comes to class work she waste a lot of time on creating the portfolio. You should dedicate more time to your research paper no matter how much she pressure you to redo the portfolio because she grades the paper really tough. Please read the required text books, you will have to refer to them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2014<br>Class Name: EXPLORE<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>very sweet lady who cares about her students deeply. the only thing that is tough is that she does not say what she expects in an assignment until student are confused about her rubric but shes an easy grader so this didnt hurt my grade. and i loved that we had to write blog posts as an assignment!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2014<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Could not stand her. Every assignment she gave seemed like she had just thought of it five minutes before because she had no clear rubric or directions. More often than not she would change the criteria of the project after everyone had already started it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2014<br>Class Name: EXPLORE<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>She does reach out to you through email and responds fast, but changes her mind all the time and last minute with no clear rubric or plan for anything. Very hard to read her mind when she doesnt make anything clear</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Enjoyed being in this class, was hard for me to get A's on papers but I did do well in the class and writing certainly improved. Choose a topic you really like and the papers won't be bad. Good Professor to have</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2014<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is simply just an awful teacher. She is such an air head, and makes large projects up on the spot without having an actual rubric. She does not say what she expects in an assignment till after the fact, and she is very illogical. I really cannot stand her as a teacher or a person.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2014<br>Class Name: HON100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Tomlin improved my writing so much. Reading the Sunday New York Times was lots of fun. Most of the class revolves around creating a portfolio. Her office hours are very helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/13/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Natalie is the cutest and quirkiest woman. I loved her personality and the way she taught and thought. I took WRD104 with her and enjoyed it. She is a hard grader, but if you put time and effort into your work she will notice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2014<br>Class Name: HON100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. Challenging class but workload is not bad. She offers lots of help outside of class and really cares about helping each student. Made us buy books but never used them. NYT subscription is also mandatory.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2013<br>Class Name: HON100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Tomlin was helpful, and I can say that her course improved my writing abilities. She isn't always clear on what's required for the next class and her syllabus is quickly out of date. This course had a lot of reading. NYT subscription mandatory. She'll help you if you ask for help. Office hours weren't the best for my schedule. Overall decent.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tomlin is a cool person, but can there's quite a bit of work in writing! She lets you pick any topic you want so pick something that interests you! Alot of revisions, it gets a bit annoying after a while. NY Times subscription is required for each Sunday and you have to read! Digication is also important! Class is fun, but just alot of writing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher ... if you have trouble writing don't take this class she doesn't help</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2013<br>Class Name: HON100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm sure this isn't the easiest English class in the world, but she really tries to get her students to try new things with their writing, and she is there to help. There is plenty of chances for revision, which is nice. I would definitely recommend her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2012<br>Class Name: HON100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Seems like she's new to teaching, but she shows a real genuine concern for her students and is very open and friendly! There are lots of papers to write, some of which can be tricky, but she devotes plenty of class time to revision and tuning of papers. Her real goal is to challenge us into outside-the-box writing; if you put forth effort youre set</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2012<br>Class Name: HON100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a really difficult grader to the point that I was not thinking as much on how to improve my writing and more on how to improve my grade. I feel like I did learn things and the class was interesting, but just too much work and too hard  of a grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Tomlin definitely helped me to increase my skills in rhetoric.  However, don't expect to go into the class and get an A without doing any work.  She expects you to work hard and, in return, will provide help whenever you ask.  Sometimes she can be irritating because she is especially particular about assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the best teacher! She is so helpful and clear about what she wants.  She encourages students to come in for help and she always is available.  Her class is great and fun! All of the students get to know each other very well. Her class is like a nice, helpful, friendly community! She is very sweet.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/04/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher and really cares about the class. Gives quite a bit of homework, but overall a really great professor who cares about her students</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a brilliant teacher, but has a relatively fun class.  I'd take it again.</div></div></div></body></html>
