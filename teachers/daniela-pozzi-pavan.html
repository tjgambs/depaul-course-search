She acts condescending if you don't understand new grammar and automatically assumes you weren't listening.  Great woman and funny, but there are better ITA teachers here - still love her though! That's why its frustrating cuz she has good potential!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2005<br>Class Name: ITALIAN111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a very easy grader, which is great, but I don't feel like I truly understood everything by the time the class ended. 12 homeworks, 3 quizzes, 20% attendance/participation, and 30% finals....Not bad..She's a very nice lady though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2005<br>Class Name: ITA111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very nice professor and tries very hard, but she is so soft spoken and it's very hard to understand her.  I don't feel like she really takes the time to explain they why.  She doesn't grab the attention of the class and she just says things but doesn'gt really teach it to you or explain it.  Try to take a different teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2005<br>Class Name: ITA111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love her! She has an infectious smile and is a gorgeous Italian woman. She suggested to have class outside and actually went through with it! A good teacher, too, I highly HIGHLY reccomend her.</div></div></div></body></html>
