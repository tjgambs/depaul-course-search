Take him if you can for intro physics. His exams are easy especially when he gives study guides that reflect what will be on the exam. His quizzes can be hard but they are reflected from the homework online, so as long as you do that you will be fine. Very motivational and great professor! loved him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2013<br>Class Name: PHY150<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Barrea is honestly one of my favorite professors I've had at DePaul. He is the most adorable man and his accent makes everything he says more interesting. quizzes and tests aren't hard because he uses the same examples as the ones he does in class. He also curves a lot and gives extra credit if you show up to all of the quizzes</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2013<br>Class Name: GENERALPHYSICS<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Barrea is THE MOST charming man ever. He is so suave and his accent omg. Quizzes and tests are easy if you come to class and participate in clicker questions. However, class practice and exam problems are NOTHING like online homework and it is so hard to complete. Google the WebAssign questions-walkthroughs of most of them are online if needed!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2012<br>Class Name: PHY150<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is not a bad professor and he means well. He's extremely nice and is known for giving second chances. If you come to class and answers questions correctly you will get extra points. Those points bumped my grade from a B to an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2012<br>Class Name: PHY150<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Barrea is awesome. Seriously, if you just come to class,DO THE HOMEWORK, and study, you'll do fine. His tests are always fair and he provides you with a good deal of practice. REVIEW YOUR TESTS AND QUIZZES. He's great and really encouraging. I can't wait to take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2012<br>Class Name: PHYS150<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Barrea is pretty hard to understand. He doesn't do examples to clarify the material. He uses the default Physics powerpoints which are basically useless. However, he really wants his students to succeed, and is helpful during office hours. He is new to DePaul, so maybe after more experience he will get better. He is a great person regardless.</div></div></div></body></html>
