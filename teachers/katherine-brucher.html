She is nice and tries, and this does help the class make it bearable. For a requirement seminar, i expected something easier, but the concepts taught and the experience she has in the field make the class much better. get ready for class participation! also make sure you read!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2009<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is kinda boring, But is very nice and very helpful if you need help. She is a very easy grader and the papers are easy no final or midterm. overall not a bad class for a sophmore seminar easy A or B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2009<br>Class Name: MUS265<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty boring, but she knows her subject and makes sure that you understand.

I can attribute much of this to the fact that I had no interest at all in the class, but at the same time I'm going to forget the material the second I complete the final.  She tries to get the class to sing along and dance, it made me feel as if I had been demoted back to the second grade.</div></div></div></body></html>
