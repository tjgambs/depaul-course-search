She is not very clear on what she expects. There is a lot of reading and weekly questions.  She talks a bunch of jibberish, and its hard to read he notes off the board (bad handwritting). The class itself is not the most difficult as long as you do the work, but I dreaded going every week. Its the worst class ever and BORING!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2005<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is the easiest B in the world.

I probably missed 55% of the class and still got a B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2005<br>Class Name: REL<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i hate her. she is hard to understand and had got an talks to you like your dumb. she makes no sense and to get through night class with her it is best if you get trashed before hand. you will need a couple of beers to sit there and not wnat to pull your upper lip over your head and just die. painfu</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2005<br>Class Name: REL244<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>THIS CLASS IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BORING. really, do not take this class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: RS264<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Hinga is a very nice woman and thoroughly explains things.  She goes over all the information you need along with lots of other stuff.  In a 3 hour class only about 30 minutes of it will be what you need.  Lecture's are boring, but class isn't hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2005<br>Class Name: AFRICANREL<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doesn't post the questions that go with the readings until the day before at the earliest which sucks if you finish the readings early.  If you are straped for time dont take her cause her readings are long and the questions are posted late so if you have to refer back to the reading you waste time</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2004<br>Class Name: REL264<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher very interesting class. She is a little hard to understand at first but it gets better. A lot of reading but if you listen to the lectures you will be fine.

The class is dull, but she's always on schedule.  Her grading is fair and she'll care about you if you show respect for her.  If you don't mind her accent, you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2004<br>Class Name: REL264<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BAD TEACHERR.

If you can handle elementary group work, senseless discussions, and staying in a night class until the end, then its worth the easy A.
