He also has a good sense of humor. Conversely, lectures can be a bit disorganized and overly mathematical. This class is reasonably difficult...definitely must spend time learning the material. Class is 40% mid-term, 50% final, and 10% (easy) quizzes. Go to class...he does not go by book so much, so be present.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2009<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>class is hard. if u dont understand the concepts you will not pass. prepare to study a lot and go beyond his lectures. dont miss any classes, some stuff he covers is not in da book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2008<br>Class Name: FIN523<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Exam is not easy, homework helped, but not all. Notes (material even not appear on the textbook) will be test. Take quality time on textbook and notes then you'll be fine. Interesting guy.Textbook is great.He gave problems and solutions so you don't need to buy workbook/study guide.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2008<br>Class Name: FIN523<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not sure what these people are talking about. Bills was my favorite Finance professor at DePaul. At times he seemed to assume too much about our prior knowledge but overall very good. Also, made a somewhat dry topic lively with a good sense of humor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2008<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWFUL! I learned nothing in this class. You can use cheat-sheet during exam, but if you don't understand the concept, its not helpful. I attended every class, took notes, and in the end ended up with C. This is my only C in the quarter. He is not helpful. You can be dumb, or not come to class, but if you have good cheat-sheet then you can make it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2008<br>Class Name: FIN523<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was a mid-term and a final. Kept it interesting with real world examples. Enjoyed the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2008<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can hardly understand the lecture.
