The class material was relevant and interesting, and his laid back style made for a very enjoyable class. Did I mention he is fricken hilarious! Take him, you won't regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/14/2011<br>Class Name: PRAD339<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My experience with Dennis was awful. Class had no structure, his teaching style is spastic, and there was absolutely no communication about grades until they were posted after finals. I was livid when I received a low grade for no reason, and when i tried to contact him about it, he avoided me for weeks. He is extremely unprofessional.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2011<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice.

I haven't started the take home final yet because he is allowing us to finish all of our other finals first. Dr G if you read this, I hope you kept my autograph... He makes class enjoyable, brings out everyone's creative side, and allows discussion. I agree with the other comment, &quot;I wish he was my dad&quot;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BEST PROFESSOR EVER! I had Dr. G. for Global Advertising and he has taught me so much. He thinks that every idea you think of is incredibly creative, which definitely boosts your ego. There's no homework, you get out early, and he basically hands you an A. No final-- just a take home exam.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Dr. Gillespie for my Focal Point class, the theme was global advertising. Honestly, he is the best teacher i have had in my entire life. He really appreciates what everyone offers to the class and let's our creative geniuses run wild. He literally said that his grading scale starts at a B...he wants everyone to succeed. you MUST take him!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2008<br>Class Name: CMN337<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had class his class TuTh from 11:50-1:20..... He said we just had to be in class by 12 and we were usually out by 12:30.... Seriously we never had to be in class... He's super fun, lets you interact in groups, and the projects are really easy.... no actual exam!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/01/2008<br>Class Name: CMN391<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a funny, and very informative prof. Never kept us the whole time, which was great if you commute. He taught the material in fun ways by doing activities. Take him! Just dont expect to get emails back asap.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2007<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>just do the homework and review the cases and problems for the midterm and final and you will get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/21/2007<br>Class Name: COM550<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Likes to fuss around with the video projector for 15-20 minutes before class, so class never starts on time. He also has a bad habit of lecturing while the projector is running, so you can't hear him over the audio track. It's not clear what he's looking for in his grading, but supposedly he's never given anyone higher than a B+.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/25/2006<br>Class Name: CMN244391<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TAKE HIM! He's great, I had him for two classes and I LOVE HIM... I wish he was my dad :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2006<br>Class Name: ALLADV<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have taken all three of Dr. G's classes. He is an advertising genius!!! He is phenomenal at what he does; however, will never act snobby about it. He loves to see creativity-even if its lame he loves it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2005<br>Class Name: CMN553<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Gillespie was interesting in class and all... but he seemed to be completely unable to give any structure to the class.  I ended up getting an A but he didn't give any feedback on work, any constructive criticism on how to improve, or clue on how to proceed studying advertising at DePaul.  He's really flighty and not fantastic.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2005<br>Class Name: CMN244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was awesome and Gillespie is even awesomer.  I looked forward to class. You get to be so creative and the more creative and out there you are the more he likes you.  I aced the midterm and I didn't really pay attention in class. The group project rocked.  Take Dr. Gillespie people! &lt;---good advice</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2005<br>Class Name: ADVERTISING<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2005<br>Class Name: CMN244<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best CMN teacher I've had a DePaul!

If you show effort, he will reach out to help you. He will also tell you if you plain suck, which is sometimes a good wake-up call. Will definitely take from this professor again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2005<br>Class Name: CMN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gillespie is advertising god. He is amazing, and his classes were my favorite at Depaul...no comparision</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2005<br>Class Name: COMM244<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Funny guy, LOVES when students talk in class. All assignments are creativity-based. Read the book, it'll help in the test (although he never really refers to it in class). There is a group project at the end- very easy. Just make sure to email him if you have to miss class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2005<br>Class Name: CMN244<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Funny & encouraging. The more you talk, the more he seems to like you. (And not necessarily based on the substance of what you say, but literally how much you talk- So participate!) Puts exactly what he wants out there and it's a good class, so it's pretty hard not to do well- Just show up and say something. Dr. Gillespie is great!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2005<br>Class Name: CMN244<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very likeable & easy going. My only problem was that he tended to favor the more outgoing, outspoken, and popular (basically overall obnoxious) students, girls in particular (though not in a creepy way).I was also dissapointed w/ the class b/c it is my favorite subject but he didn't provide much real insight from his experience in advertising.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2005<br>Class Name: CMN244<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Gillespie is a great man! Although he is a little &quot;loopie&quot; in his teaching and mind, he is good hearted. Easy Mid-term, Easy Final...all you do is make commercials once a week. Tells you what will be on tests and as long as you show up, he will give you a good grade. Take him, you wont regret it</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2005<br>Class Name: CMN244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great teacher!  As long as you go to the classes and do the homework there is no way you can get less then a C.  He is by far the best teacher Ive had at Depaul.  I have yet to find someone who didnt like him for a teacher.</div></div></div></body></html>
