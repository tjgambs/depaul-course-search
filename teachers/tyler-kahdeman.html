He's an authority on the topic he teaches and knows a lot of other experts in the field. He sincerely cared about the class and challenged us to think critically, without an overload of homework. He's very engaging with the class and gave extra credits I would take his class again!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Kahdeman is both an outstanding Professor and individual. His teaching methods are rather unorthodox but you invest time and thoughts with him, you are greatly rewarded. Very sensitive material is covered in this class and the fact that he is able to maintain a neutral and positive environment for all is remarkable. TAKE THIS PROFESSOR.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very passionate, had a lot to say and was very interested in the input of other students.

He was definitely biased in favor of liberal thinking. He did allow people to have opinions differing from his but you could tell that he got offended. He gives extra credit. He appreciates students who participate and are passionate. You learn much in this class.

I feel as if Prof. Kahdeman truly understood the lives of students and sincerely cared for them. Prof. Kahdeman has made me enthusiastic toward the future.  I immensely enjoyed having Prof. Kahdeman as an incredible ininstructor, and really enjoyed the course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2012<br>Class Name: SCU207<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a kind-hearted professor!

The understanding of the material and students using their minds is what he requests.  He is very easy to work with and very understanding of situations.  His flexibility is a great asset for himself and students.  He is true educator.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2011<br>Class Name: SCU207<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome!

Really laid back and totally understands the stress students are under and believes in giving you a second chance if you miss a quiz.  He makes the class interesting and you actually want to show up to see what topic will be discussed next.  Prof. K also gives amazing feedback too!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/27/2010<br>Class Name: SCG410<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. K is a great teacher!

Wish I would have enrolled in the 10 week session instead of summer session I.  The discussions were wonderful and insightful. There was never a dull class.

His feedback was thorough and engaging.  I'd taken other ethics courses and felt that the professor enjoyed confusing us.  Dr. K led, but didn't give answers.  His discussions were also engaging and allowed room for in depth reflection and honesty.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2010<br>Class Name: ETH0<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. K gave great feedback on all assignments.

He is such a nice man, and the class is very interesting. Reading is very important and your grade depends on it; however, the reading isn't bad at all. He is more than willing to work with you and is very understanding. His class is simple- do the work and you'll get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2010<br>Class Name: SCU207<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I HATED THIS CLASS.  He rambled like crazy.  He was extremely passionate about stupid things like &quot;peer reviewed sources!&quot; His lectures could be summed up in about 10 minutes but the class is an hour and a half.  I spent the whole time wishing he would shut up.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2009<br>Class Name: SCU207<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's great! It is intimidating at first because of the huge focus on the 10 page paper but he isn't bad at all. He is a very understanding professor and he understands that humans make mistakes. He is great at explaining material...totally worth it taking him for SCU 207!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/28/2009<br>Class Name: SCU207<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think he means well, but he goes to such great lengths to get students to like him, it's just painful to listen to (he thinks he's hilarious). He is patronizing in his attempts to be &quot;friends.&quot; I often had a laptop with me in class and just once of twice, on a hunch, I would check the statistics he was quoting. He is so full of it! He grabs rando</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2009<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He takes self-promotion to an entirely different level. He wrote one of the two mandatory texts and frequently cites himself. The problem is that his glorified pamphlet is repetitive and useless in the world of education. To learn applicable material avoid Dr. K but for an easy A I would recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2009<br>Class Name: SCU207<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was the most worth while and worth the money I have taken yet Dr. K is really good and really straight forward. I'm going to take him again when I can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2009<br>Class Name: SCU207<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor!  Understands that you have a life outside of his class and the university.  Interesting material, was a bit dry and repetitive a few times, but overall a great class.

He was always willing to work with us when life situations came about. His delivery of the course material was excellent and participated in the course work as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2009<br>Class Name: SCU207<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked having Dr. K as a teacher. He was funny and told you exactly what he expected of you. Some of the lectures were somewhat dry.. and if he doesn't draw a pendulum clock or bridge.. class just wont seem right. ha! anyway... i highly suggest you take him for SCU 207. Not a bad class at all!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2009<br>Class Name: EDU207<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. K is a great! he is very fair look he dose not lie or anything he tells you how it is. simple if you do what you are suppose to do it should be an A the term paper was 15 pages but he cut it down to 10 and if you do what he asked like i said you should get a good grade what a great guy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2009<br>Class Name: SCU207<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. K seems like a difficult professor at first. Really, he was fair and accomodating. At first he assigned a 15 pg paper but then when everyone talked to him he changed it to a 10 pg paper. The class consists of 3 quizzes, 1 paper, and 1 debate, which was not bad at all. Overall, good class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2009<br>Class Name: SCU207<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. K is an amazing teacher. This class seemed like a really hard one but in reality it wasn't as bad.  You are allowed to miss two classes but after that you are forced to drop the class.  3 quizzes (really easy if you read the book) and one 10-15 pg term paper. He is an awesome teacher, highly reccomanded!! Very helpful and loves teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2009<br>Class Name: SCU207<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. K's enthusiasm and respect for the students made this class great. He works hard to help his students do well and provides many opportunities for extra credit. Super nice and really fair.

I am a person that has zero research/stats abilities. I would not have passed this class had it not been for Dr. K. and his helpfulness. The course is set up to make a student succeed. I highly recommend him to a student like myself who is not a research minded person.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/29/2008<br>Class Name: SCG410<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Kahdeman is a professional yet relaxed and personable professor. He effectively engenders a productive and comfortable classroom atmosphere. Showing a genuine passion, he is able to bring interest to a topic that can tend to be a little &quot;dry.&quot;  I can't imagine a better way to learn about research and highly recommend Dr. Kahdeman for SCG 410.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/28/2008<br>Class Name: SCU207<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are looking to be an educator that makes a difference and looking to learn a lot from the readings assigned in class this is the class for you.  If you are looking to get an easy grade and do not care what you learn maybe you should not take this class. This class was fun and Dr. K is not only a great teacher but also very fair.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2008<br>Class Name: SCG410<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was actually very nervous taking this class after reading these reviews on Dr. K. Yes, he dresses uniquely, & makes jokes. But he is fair, will go above & beyond to help you if you just ask, & you will learn (gasp) cause he knows his stuff. If you highlight the book during class, send him emails before turning things in, and try, you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2008<br>Class Name: SCG410<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He spends a lot of time talking about personal stuff: kids, books he's writing, etc. He repeats lectures. Once he starts teaching he just keeps talking...without taking a break.  He wears crazy clothes for some entertainment value&#63; Why is such an intensive research class is required for a teaching degree. Other class should be in it's place.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/31/2008<br>Class Name: SCG410<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a fair grader, laid all the requirements out at the start. Was a summer session and due to a shortened term, deadlines and requirements needed to be adjusted, but were decided on with consensus. He was thorough in his reviews of the assignments. Take him for this class! Many grades throughout the class, rather than one grade at the end.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2008<br>Class Name: FX101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed Dr. K's class immensely!(Ethical Business Behavior). I believe I am more politically conservative than he, however Dr Kahdeman was very respectful of my opinions. Indeed, he was respectful of everyone. His syllabus was very clear.

Far below expectations for a graduate class.  Class assignments were explained in an ambiguous manner and left room for much confusion.
