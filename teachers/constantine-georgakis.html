I am usually really good at math, but the professor was NOT a good teacher. He was really hard to understand, and he was very unorganized in his lessons. Because of this you will have to teach yourself from the book a lot. Many students dropped/ withdrew from the class. AVOID THIS CLASS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2012<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AVOID! The guy is nice, but like comments above said, he makes plenty of mistakes, making studying really hard from his material. Tests are super small, so every little point will impact big on your grade.Tests are nothing like covered in class nor homework. Good Luck!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2012<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A terrible experience. Had to teach myself Everything. Is not helpful will tell yo go to Tutoring. Makes plenty of mistakes. His tests are only 6 questions which are 20 perc.

Definitely knows the material.  But...  But he is very ineffective at communicating this knowledge.  He doesn't use the text.  Instead he uses handouts that are filled with mistakes.  He didn't have a class web site, which was annoying since nobody ever understood what he was assigning for homework.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2011<br>Class Name: MATH135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AVOID!!!AVOID!!!!AVOID!!! HAD I KNOWN ABOUT THIS SITE PRIOR TO ENROLLING INTO HIS CLASS, I DEFINITELY WOULD HAVE CHOSEN ANOTHER PROFESSOR. HE TALKS TO THE BOARD, ASSUMES EVERYONE KNOWS CALCULUS, HE MAKES SEVERAL MISTAKES IN EACH CLASS, AND ON HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS.

He does not how to teach and assumes everyone knows calculus... on a first level course and then if a lot of people fail the exam he doesnt care.

Unclear, inarticulate, and constantly makes mistakes. His notes are filled with computational and conceptual errors. Half the class leaves after break, and why not&#63; You have to teach yourself the content anyway b/c he's incompetent. The worst teacher I've had here or anywhere else for that matter. Just avoid him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2010<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher ever. I got sick in his class and was forced to take an Incomplete in the class. He responded once to my 17 e-mails, and when i went to go take the test, he said that he did not have it. Avoid him at all costs. You would have better luck teaching yourself, as he never explains anything, and has the class correct him every 5 minutes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2009<br>Class Name: A125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher Ive had at Depaul yet.

He comes to class late, very unclear about his examples and his methods are horrible. Goes every where and is not CLEAR! EXTREMELY BORING!!!! You will get a bad grade if you are not familiar with Calculus. There are far better teachers out there AVOIDE HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2008<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Georgakis might not be the most interesting guy.. I'll admit it does take a bit of effort to stay engaged in his lectures.. IF you don't understand something don't be afraid to ask..While showing up to class doesn't earn you any points, he does notice and definitely seems to take that into consideration when grading.. Good Luck!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2008<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>pretty good. goes over examples alot, and thoroughly explains things. the problem is he talks at a whisper so its impossible to hear him. doesn't really stop for questions unless you yell something out loud. nice curve on tests. i got a D on my first test but recovered on midterm and final and got a B- in teh class. wouldnt really recommend him tho</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly, he was terrible. His notes on the board were nearly impossible to read. He jumped around the board a lot. He faced the board nearly the whole class so we couldn't understand what he was saying. Honestly I feel that he was an incompetent professor and would NOT suggest him to ANYONE! 3 tests, so if you screw up... you're done!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/22/2008<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a boring teacher. But he did explain things very well. Sucks that the 3 tests were the only grades. means well but comes off rude at times.basically you cant have a bad test or your grade will suffer. But he has a very nice curve.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/15/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Well, he did tend to drag on and yes, sometimes he was hard to follow...but all you have to do his ask him questions! Went to his office all the time and he was always more than happy to help.  He's super sweet and funny! Sure, there are teachers that are &quot;easier&quot; than others, but this guy isn't unbearable.  Keep up and you will be fine...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2007<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you didn't take calc in High School I would avoid this teacher.  Seems like a nice guy but is very unclear about what he is doing most of the time. You only take 3 tests and that is your entire grade. ON the plus side he doesnt collect homework or care about attendance which was nice for night class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2007<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>can i cry&#63; i failed this course and thats all there is to say. please dont take the night class, youll end up leaving after the break just like 3/4 of the class always does. he lacks fluency in the english language and makes the calculus difficult when it really isnt. you kinda of have to do it his way on the tests or you wont make it. save yoursel</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2007<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>just like the person below me.. where do i begin&#63; attendance doesnt count and he could care less if you walk out in the middle of the class. we get a 20 minute break and about half of the class is gone after that. 3tests equal your final grade. he takes extra unnessecary steps to solve problems and makes the stupidest mistakes</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2007<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>damn, where do  i begin&#63; you only take three tests which is your final grade. He makes the problems more difficult when they really arent. Take him if you have already taken any form of calc or trig in high school because you cant really understand anything that comes out of his mouth. Also, he tends to make stupid mistakes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2007<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You can't really understand what he says.  Your attendence, homework, or any other work doesn't count.  The only thing that counts is three tests and he doesn't teach very well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2007<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>sometimes he mumbles so it's hard to hear him, also sometimes when expalaining a problem makes mistake (students offen correct him).  likes to throw in a joke here and there. to get an A in his class you need to do homework and just take notes in class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2006<br>Class Name: BMS135<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a fun teacher.

Georgakis is the man.  I had fun in his class.  If you get him to interact, the class is hilarious, otherwise you are sitting there bored out of your mind.  Overall, you should get Goergakis if you can.  It also helps if you had calculus in highschool too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2006<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you take proper notes and follow his procedures of doing math, you will do fine. The teaching style is a standard math lecture, so do not expect a action packed class. Grades are determined by three tests (Always appeal for a better grade since he is known to make many errors). Attendence is not mandatory but reccomended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2006<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He definately isn't the most enthusiastic guy, but he can crack a few funny jokes here and there.  Although he doesn't make the subject easy, if you really pay attention and go to his office hours, you should be fine.  The cutest, nicest guy ever!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2006<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The cutest old man alive but HORRIBLE teacher! So unclear and ALWAYS makes mistakes. There are only 3 grades, so if you mess up one test you are screwed. He always appeared to teach things the hard way and he was just very difficult to follow. I ended up dropping the class bc I coulnt learn the basic fundamentals from him. I DEF. do not recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2006<br>Class Name: CALC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful.

All he does is do problems on the board and assumes you know what he's talking about.  Makes errors frequently and does not go over the material that is on the test.

Worst teacher by far!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2005<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do yourself a favor and find another prof.

He does make a lot of tiny mistakes that students point out here and there, but if you know what you're doing and are good at calculus you'll do fine.  He doesnt collect homework or give a lot of homework, he just grades on tests.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/01/2005<br>Class Name: MATH<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2005<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love this teacher.
