She is amazing. From beginning to end, she always makes sure her students understand what she is saying. She always looks around to make sure everyone in the class is signing correctly. She gives homework after every class but it is easy and NECESSARY to learn the language. If she taught ASL 2, I would take her class in a heartbeat.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2014<br>Class Name: ASL104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Patti is my favorite professor I've had in college! Ive taken her ASL classes since 101 and am now going into ASL 105. She is extremely helpful and wants you to succeed. Patti is Deaf and does not tolerate when students talk in class because there is a no voice policy. From day 1 you will be completely immersed in ASL and will surely learn quickly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2014<br>Class Name: ASL104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Patti is my favorite professor I've had in college! I've taken her ASL classes since 101 and am now going into ASL 105. She is extremely helpful and wants you to succeed. As with other DePaul ASL classes, there is a NO VOICE policy even from day 1 when you don't know anything. Patti is Deaf and does not tolerate when students break this policy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2014<br>Class Name: ASL102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Patti is an amazing, gifted teacher. She's also an incredibly gracious and a good person. My whole class loved her and made every effort to stick with her for the year. Showing up to class is a must and so is doing the homework, but that goes for any language. You get what you put in the class. She's fair and helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2014<br>Class Name: ASL101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Phadke is the best! She is extremely helpful and makes the class really fun! I would highly recommend her to anyone. However, doing the homework assigned and attending each class is a MUST. She gives no make-ups and you do not really learn without being there.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2012<br>Class Name: ASL102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super nice professor. She's so sweet and clearly loves what she does. She knows how to teach really well but her grading is weird. One word wrong for one sentence can knock you back 5 points. Plus, the events and tutors you have to go to are kind of unnecessary. I don't know why she requires them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2011<br>Class Name: ASL101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>such a sweetheart. come to class (you will miss a lot if you don't since it's a visual language) and DON'T TALK- IT'S RUDE</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2010<br>Class Name: ASL101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Seriously, best teacher ever. She is so cute and she really cares about her class. If you need an elective, take ASL! Attendance not mandatory, but helpful.I can now write on resumes that I am conversational in ASL and got a call for an interview!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2010<br>Class Name: ASL103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Patti is adorable. She's so sweet and helpful and relates class material to her personal life to help you understand. She's extremely understanding-once my alarm didn't go off & I missed class & she let me make up the test before the next class period for credit! What other prof would let you do that&#63; She's worth the early morning trip downtown!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2009<br>Class Name: ASL101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher can be confusing cause she's deaf and none of us know ASL yet. Sweet but can be a mean when people are talking in class. Ur only allowed to talk in ASL. Starts out really slow but after the 2nd unit it speeds up a lot. When you buy the book transfer the CD's to another case b/c the slip in the book scratches the cd's beyond repair.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2009<br>Class Name: ASL101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. She's funny and always helpful. Attendance is really mandatory, but missing class can't be hard with learning vocab. ASL is so easy to learn, but Patti makes it fun.</div></div></div></body></html>
