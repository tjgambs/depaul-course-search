If you're into Japanese, take Chessick-sensei. Show up, participate, ask questions. You'll be fine. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2014<br>Class Name: JPN104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Between her and Anno-sensei, choose Chessick. Very clear on the grammar and always answers questions. Attendance is mandatory, weekly quizzes on vocabulary and kanji,midterm, and a final with 10% being an oral exam. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2014<br>Class Name: JPN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's great. Having an English native speaker in the beginning levels of foreign language study can really help your intellectual understanding of the material. But otherwise, she's just great in general. Good humor, makes class interesting. Go with Chessick.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2012<br>Class Name: JPN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a great teacher!!! She is so nice and helpful. We learned so much but she taught it in a way that made it really easy. She is easy to talk to if you need help and really wants everyone to succeed. I have a different teacher for JPN 102 and she said we could stop by her office if we need help. Take her!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2009<br>Class Name: JPN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's so nice, very helpful, a very good teacher. A lot of work; vocab quizzes, midterm, & final. Loved it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2006<br>Class Name: JPN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Chessick-sensei is a great teacher. She's so nice and intelligent. Japanese was easy for me, but there were people who were struggling. If you study, trust me you'll do well. Come to class cuz she marks off for absences. Participate and have fun learning a new language! :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2006<br>Class Name: JPN100102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awsome teacher! She taught everything the way it should be taught. You learn it, memorize it, practice it, and then later you are given a review sheet to help make sure you are on track before midterms and finals. The only problem with this class is that it is too fast-paced. If you can keep up with it, then go for it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2006<br>Class Name: JPN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's the nicest lady in the world.  Her class can get frustratingly hard, but she makes concepts as clear as possible in the time she has and is always willing to help out.  Her cheerfulness makes the class a whole lot easier to make it through.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2006<br>Class Name: JPN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best Japanese teacher so far. (I've had three.) She is very nice and understanding.  Japanese is difficult, but she makes it as easy as it can be.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2005<br>Class Name: JPN104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the BEST professors I have ever had. Her class is hard, but it needs to be or you'd never learn japanese. She is really organized, and super nice, and want all her student to suceed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2005<br>Class Name: JPN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best Teacher Ever!!!1!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2005<br>Class Name: JAPANESE<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She plays favorites and in order to be on her good side you must have Japanese as you number one priority. For those of you who are majoring in Japanese this might be a good thing but for all the others, she doesn't like the fact that we have other priorities before Japanese!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2004<br>Class Name: JPN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's a great Japanese teacher. If you pay attention and participate in class, then you should have no problem with the hw, and quizzes. plus the quizzes are extremely easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2004<br>Class Name: JPN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I recommend only taking this class if you have a genuine interest in Japanese. The professor is good, but its a lot of homework and memorization. Overall, I'd give the class a B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2004<br>Class Name: JPN10103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SHE IS SOMEWHAT ANAL WITH SPELLING BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S JAPANESE SO YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO WRITE IT CORRECTLY. SHE IS NICE, MAKES LEARNING JAPANESE FUN, GIVES LOTS OF EXAMPLES, AND HAND OUTS SO YOU CAN BETTER GET A GRASP ON THE LANGUAGE.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2004<br>Class Name: JPN<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She can make you feel dumb and will take lots of points off for spelling or non-perfect handwriting.  However, she really knows the Japanese language and she can teach in a way to make you understand like native speakers can't.
