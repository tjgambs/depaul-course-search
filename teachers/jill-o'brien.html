You take 5 quizzes and she drops the lowest 2, a pointless paper about consulting firms, a midterm, final, and article summary paper and she's a hard grader, so don't take her unless you need a class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2013<br>Class Name: ORGC355<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her class is very repetitive, felt like I learned more by reading the texbook than I did by going to her classes. You take 6 quizzes(2 are dropped, a midterm, final, and two papers. While it seems like a lot, once you start working on it all, it's not too bad. You can miss up to four classes throughout the quarter when usually it's two.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2011<br>Class Name: CMNS211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She told me she used to be a dean and wanted to get close to the students by teaching.

She is an extremely caring person. She will help you with any topic (class related or not.)She loves what she teaches and you can tell.

You take notes all period long. Doesnt use blackboard and at the end of the quarter has two major assignments and final due, so you're left trying to guess your grade.

She mentioned many times she does not have much time because she teaches so many classes and other students.
