The material presented was usually interesting and he had good examples to show. The assignments were excellent and his grading on papers was not too rough. The 2 exams were incredibly hard though, with a lot of memorization that really challenged me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2013<br>Class Name: ABD248<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great guy but really boring. So many papers that take a lot of work and research. His midterms and finals are really hard! memorizing 30 pictures and everything about them and only having 6 on the tests and after that there are short answer questions(really hard). Attendance is mandatory and you have to do the readings and present to class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2011<br>Class Name: HAA222<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Prof. Delancey! He's such a sweetie, and he dictates everything you need to know in class. If you take notes, you won't even need the text book- I didn't even open mine. The only reason people have trouble in his class is because they aren't interested enough in the material. If you're expecting all art and no history, don't take this class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2011<br>Class Name: ART222<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Smart Guy. Boring Class. He needs to be more creative with the way he teaches. He makes the class memorize 30 pictures and tests you on about 10 of them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2009<br>Class Name: HAA101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Anyone who has taken an art history class knows how challenging it can be for the professors to create interest in the subject, and Dr. DeLancey does his best.  I sympathize w/him because of the crap he has to deal with in class. Tests are not bad at all and his grading is more than fair.  Pay attention in class, and study your slides- you're good!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2009<br>Class Name: HAA101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof DeLancey really isn't bad. All you have to do is show up for class, and add your opinion once in a while. 2 papers, 2 tests that are not hard if you study the slides he give you. The class is a bit boring by not bad</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2008<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was supposed to be a class about the history of art, and instead of reading the textbook we memorized random slide of art. Lectures were very vague, and his grading is extremely picky, even for a general education course. You would benefit more to take someone who knows how to teach the material in a more clear manner</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2008<br>Class Name: ART251<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He required 60 slides to be memorized for a midterm and only 7 were on the test.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2007<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's as bad as some of the comments say he is. Very vague and arbitrary grading, unhelpful, and the midterm and final are so difficult you might as well just wing it, because even if you study there might be some art on the test that you barely studied at all. I definitely wouldn't recommend him to anyone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2007<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Everyone is being a little ridiculous. He is annoying about attendance, but as long as you show up he isnt bad. I did fine on the final paper and of course it was kind of boring. How interesting can art history be.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2006<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>15% of your grade is just showing up, he is not that hard of a grader and he's really nice.  If he likes you, you'll do fine.  The midterm and final are impossible so don't bother studying, just do well on everything else and you'll get a good grade for the class.  People are being way to harsh, the art was amazing and this class was not that bad!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2006<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the worst professor I've ever had. Boring, terrible lectures. Seems knowledgable about the subject at first, but he's not. I recieved a D even though I showed up to every class and did decent on the exams. Gave me a D on the final paper, then failed to provide any real reason why. Virtually no grading criteria. avoid this guy at all costs.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2006<br>Class Name: ART246<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>don't Take this professor! classes are extremely boring! and a very hard grader on papers! i did everything that he asked and more and i still got a C+ on the paper & i usually get A's on art history papers! i went to ask him a couple questions and he wasn't helpful and was irritated the whole time. he also plays MAJOR favorites!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2006<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor i have ever had, grades very hard on all of the papers, mid-term and final are crazy hard, and likes to talk about nothing, if you like to sleep alot in class take it but if you want to learn something dont.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2006<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I BEG you - PLEASE do not take this man, unless you enjoy torture for 3 days a week. If DePaul does not fire him, then there's something very wrong with this institution. He is completely inept and the final was absolutely absurd. I can't look at a painting/sculputre/building without reliving the pain of this course. And I used to love art....</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2006<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is sooooo boring, half the class fell asleep on a daily basis.  Not a very hard grader on papers but the midterm and final were ridiculously difficult.  Avoid him if at all possible.  He makes me hate art history.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2006<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Needs to be clear about what type of grading scale he uses. He told me that I &quot;completed the assignment well&quot; on a paper but gave me a c+ anyway for a part that was missing but it wasn't even in the description of the assignment. He's also rather boring and totally made me lose my interest for this topic completely.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2006<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>meh. boring class. all you do is look at slides, and he posts them on blackboard so going to class all the time isnt really important, you're allowed 3 absences. The midterm and final are hard because he doesnt give you what slides you are supposed to know. Grades hard. avoid it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2006<br>Class Name: ART101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DROP the CLASS now if you are enrolled in his African Studies course for winter 2007!!!!! You will regret it if you don't!!!!!!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2006<br>Class Name: ART101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor taken at DePaul. Shows no interest in material at all, assignments are vague and graded harshly. Midterms and final are not on material discussed in class, essentially making class useless. This guy is a joke and should be fired.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2006<br>Class Name: ART246<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is pretty boring. The midterm wasn't too hard if you studied. He isn't very clear on what he wants. It takes him about 10 minutes until everyone understands. When I needed help he kind of seemed bothered but still gave me some helpful hints. You have to be very interested in African Art to really appreciate this course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2006<br>Class Name: ARTHI102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Midterm was impossible with all the slides we were supposed 2 memorize.Papers are a formalanalysis,exhibition review& research paper.  He doesn't explain in class how to write the papers and is vague in what he wants us to include in them.  Most people (myselfincluded) have never written. This is lower level, should b a bit easier or more helpful</div></div></div></body></html>
