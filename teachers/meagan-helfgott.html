Would recommend her to anyone. Always cheerful and a smile on her face, which makes the classroom that much better. Informative, and very knowledgeable. Her lectures run off powerpoints, so it gets redundant. Recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2004<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.
