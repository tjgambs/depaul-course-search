Not an easy grader and you need to do the reading but he really turned a class I was ambivalent about into a great course, very interesting lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2006<br>Class Name: HST279<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome guy! He's very interested in the subject so it makes class bearable..offers a lot of help with papers, gives a study guide for midterm/final. You need to read, and do the work, but overall great class. I'd take him again</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2006<br>Class Name: HST<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor, not that easy, but interesting.

He's not an easy teacher but he is def an awesome teacher though.  He really knows his stuff and so it makes class bearable.  He gives a study guide for the tests (midterm and final), there are 3 essays but you only have to do 2.  Overall...I highly recommend this teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2006<br>Class Name: HIST281<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You will take a lot of notes, but he is probably the best lecturer that I have ever heard. He is willing to help whenever you need it. But warning... there is a lot of reading...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2006<br>Class Name: HST350<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he was a good guy, really clear and only spoke about what we were tested on. but he is a real tight ass when it comes 2 marking! make sure u no what ur talking about u cant bs any paper in this class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/22/2005<br>Class Name: HST<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's awesome. Students need to work and write in order to do well in his class, and you'll take tons of notes. But he has a way of teaching where the info just sticks in ur head. He's very interesting and really likes class participation. He enjoys getting everyone in on class discussions so come prepared. He will call you out for not speaking.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2005<br>Class Name: HST281<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was really interesting. If you like lecture classes, take it, because he is probably THE BEST LECTURER at DePaul. Very clear! I agree with the comments below...focus on the 'why.' 2 papers (3-5 pages), midterm and final are both short answer and essay...very fair grader.  Would definitely recommend to others :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2005<br>Class Name: WESTERNHISTORY<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2005<br>Class Name: HST281<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>frank is awesome. yeah he lectures a lot, but hes not monotonous. take your notes or bring a recorder. 2 papers. short midterm and final. best prof at depaul, imo</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2005<br>Class Name: HST281<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not the easiest class ever but the most interesting given the period of history.  More concerned with the how and why than the names and dates...which is a good thing!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2005<br>Class Name: HIST280<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree mostly with the previous mentioned, he is helpful and will take time out of class in order that you fully understand the course material presented during his lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/14/2005<br>Class Name: HST280<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is in no way easy but he does the best he can to prepare his students for the exams and papers. If you hate history don't take the class but if you want a challenge he is the professor to take. He is very sweet and helpful and tries his best to accomodate to students' needs. I reccommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2005<br>Class Name: HST281<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I filled almost an entire notebook with lecture notes. Most of the class is writing (notes from lectures and papers) and he's a hard grader on papers. Although the class is not easy, hes an awesome educator and expects a lot out of his students because he gives a lot to begin with. Dont waste your $ on the books.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2005<br>Class Name: HST281<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Frank's a cool guy. but your hand might hurt from lectures and he's a tough grader, but still worth taking. However, don't waste your money by buying the books he assigns... he discusses them for 10 minutes and that's it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2005<br>Class Name: HST281<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Frank previously taught at Northwestern and it shows. His class is completely based on lecture and reading 6 texts.  He grades pretty tough, so it's not a blow off class like some other DePaul classes.  Discussion is mandatory, so I wouldn't recommend it if you don't like to talk. Minimal effort would get you a C.. so an A is definitely attainable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2005<br>Class Name: HST281<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Frank is by far the best professor I have had at DePaul. His classes are interesting and he is a great guy. 3 papers one is optional and a midterm and final that are easy. He is a hard grader but pay attention and it will be easy. Haven't read one book yet and I am dominating this class. Overall a great guy you want to have him for any US class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: WESTHIST<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BORING! But who likes history&#63; He's a real nice guy who loves his history man! Lectures are impt. and reading is impt. Papers were hard but he's an easy grader! I really liked him!

Never read!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2005<br>Class Name: HST281<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ver interesting class, lots of interesting info, and i mean lots.  Bring a voice recorder to get all the notes.  3 papers, 1 of them are optional.  midterm and final aren't hard if you pay attention in class.  i read 2 of 6 assigned readings and passed with a B</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2005<br>Class Name: HST281<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought the class was not hard, but you surely had to work to get a good grade. 2/3 papers (1 is optional) mid-term and final. He is a very tough grader, but he won't give you lower than a C, unless you really did not do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2005<br>Class Name: HST281<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I read one of the 6 assigned books and walked away with an A.

Lots of reading, but u can get away w/o reading ALL. Short papers are fairly easy. Tests cover class lectures, no suprises, arent too difficult if you pay attn/take good notes.

There is a lot of reading, but it is a History calss. Lectures could be a little boring and he is very hard when it comes to papers. If you are prepared to learn and ask questions, you will be fine.
