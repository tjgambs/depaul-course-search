We have quizzes every class, but the class internalizes the work very well! Her great energy allows every one to feel open to participate. She is also very dedicated outside the classroom! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2014<br>Class Name: ABD100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Moody-Freeman is one of my favorite professors! I was not very excited about taking African and Black Diaspora studies but I'm very glad that I did! There are readingsnotes every night, a quiz every class (easy if you read), a midterm,2 short papers, and a final. The class is discussion based and participation and attendance matter!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2014<br>Class Name: WORLDSFAIR<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is honestly the nicest person and a very helpful down-to-earth professor. She is fair and fun and makes her class interesting and keeps everyone engaged . The class load is little much at first, but once you get the swing of things the class will be a blast</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An easy A. Homework is usually a reading 5-10 pages followed by in class discussion. Topics discussed are interesting. Sometimes you get quizzed on the readings. Midterm and final are papers! Take your LSP200 with her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/29/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice professor. Very clear of what she wants in papers. Group discussion ALL THE TIME. A couple of 3 paged papers, take home mid term, group project and a final paper. Just skim thru the readings. Hint: choose to do your group project early so you can focus on the final paper. She puts a lot of deadlines towards the end of class. Easy grader</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There was a lot of reading and a lot of work for a sophmore requirement class. She is an easy grader who encourages students to have discussions on the readings. Over half of the quarter was taught by students. Class seemed to drag on. Overall, a so-so professor who gives a lot of work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst class I have ever taken. Discussions were dry and frequently very uninformative. Assignments were mostly repeating the text back to her verbatim. Actively discouraged original thought in the papers. Managed to set up the syllabus so that over half the quarter was taught by students. Take her if you don't mind learning nothing new at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2010<br>Class Name: ABD100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Moody-Freeman was an excellent teacher. After fiding out how many books we were going to read, I got nervous but the books were not too long or difficult. The class always had intiguing discussions that made time fly by! Popquizzes were given, but if you're keeping up with the reading their easy. I loved her!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2009<br>Class Name: DSCDONT<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Is a very good example of learning why culture and background are so important thru the course belizeans in Chicago...loved this class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2009<br>Class Name: ABD101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's pretty good.  Sometimes I zone in and out of her class though.  I usually pay attention but she can never really hold my interest for the whole hour and a half. She offers a lot of office hours and is there when you need her. She's a nice funny woman and class discussions are funny. The students make the class, not her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2008<br>Class Name: ABD000<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was awesome.(Blacks and Love) Not sure it was that informative but class discussions were very interesting.

She is very intelligent and down to earth. I really enjoyed her approach to teaching this class on Blacks in Love. I only wish that I could have discovered her much earlier.

I got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher!
