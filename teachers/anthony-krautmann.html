He knows a lot about what he teaches. He lectures the entire class and they can be long at times but, he is usually pretty enthusiastic about what he is teaching. You do get homework but it isn't every class and not that difficult. The tests are relatively hard. Make sure to study for them!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2015<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Krautmann is a decent professor. His lectures are long and pretty dense but the information is all there and the notes are online. Don't even attempt to skip class though, he takes off big for absences and his exams are straight from his lectures. Note: his 2 exams make up 80% of your grade. Be prepared.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2015<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tony is a great professor! He lectures the entire class period, but always kept me interested because he was SO enthusiastic! He is THE quickest grader ever, always willing to help and clear in his instruction! This course was very b&w. There was no gray area to recover points. You either knew it or you didn't. If you stay engaged you will do well!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2015<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He lectures the whole class, but he really knows the subject and teaches it in a way that interests students. His tests are tough and you will really need to study for the mid term and final exam as they amount to 80% of your grade. He's a good guy and there for you if you need help, but the class is a little more on the challenging side.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2015<br>Class Name: ECON<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He has to be one of the smartest professor's at DePaul University!  Very funny, very nice, and I really wanted to listen to his every word.  He knows so much and he has a gift to speak to all,,,</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2015<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His lectures are far from being like the test. I studied hard but I didn't get what I wanted for this class. It completely messed up my gpa.  If I knew I would not have taken this class.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2015<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TONY! Great guy, very helpful.  A little abstract with his lectures, and does tend to go on short tangents, but they usually come back and relate to the topic. Took Eco 105 with crazy Eastern European lady the year before. Krautmann is like like night and day. Helpful not a lot of homework. But be prepared to study for exams. 1010 would take again</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2015<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Indeed, his tests are difficult and include a lot of thinking out of the box. I really enjoyed his class because I took the time to understand what he was teaching. I asked questions and kept up with each lesson. Another thing that helped me greatly was the SI sessions that were available. Don't be lazy and get ready to study your butt off. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2014<br>Class Name: ECO505<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is all calculus, no economics. His test are MUCH harder than HW, but if you can complete his study guides to their entirety, you are ready for the test. But you should also review notes, he always throws one curve-ball question in there. Grading is VERY reasonable. Doesn't encourage office hours, but willing to help in class. HW easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2014<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: C-</div><div id="right"><div>Basically like everyone else's comments.. His lectures and homework's are no where near as difficult as the tests. Homework and attendance are worth 20% of your grade which is a nice cushion but not worth it. He rambles to himself and talks very causally while his tests are not. Be prepared to work hard for a C</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2014<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: C</div><div id="right"><div>Krautmann is not a good professor. Midterm and Final exams were difficult and tricky while hw assignments seemed easy. Classtime is devoted to stories and simply topics while tests are very advanced. Ended the class with a C-, DO NOT TAKE</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2014<br>Class Name: ECON336<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: C</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take.  He does not care about his students.  Easy homework will deceive you.  His notes are scattered and he lectures the entire time without pause.  Homework and class lectures do NOT prepare you for the exams, which are extremely difficult.  The majority of our class did very poorly on exams and he blamed it on us.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2014<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tony Krautmann is a great guy, but a not-so-great professor. In class, he tends to ramble on incoherently, often ending up on strange tangents, while juggling the microeconomics course load. What he explained in the class and in his notes (btw you don't need the book for his class), was COMPLETELY different from the final. Beware. Take someone else</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2013<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really not as hard as a lot of people will say; however, there is a big discrepancy between HW and test difficulty. He has a big pacing problem: too much of the course is spent on simple, elementary concepts while trickier concepts that come later are rushed. Probably a good choice if this is your first econ class; otherwise look elsewhere.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2013<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Krautmann offered an interesting perspective to an entry-level course that ultimately helped me decide to add Economics as one of my majors. Sure, his tests were hard - especially the final - but he was so emphatic and engaging during his lectures, and made me want to pay attention and take copious notes. Dont be afraid to ask clarifying questions!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2012<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take This Professor! I have a bad tendency of sleeping in many of my classes, but this guys lectures kept me awake and excited. I loved going to his class and he literally changed my perception of the world almost every class. Definitely take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2011<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOME professor! His lectures are really interesting and he is very dedicated to the material. Midterm and Final are pretty difficult, but as long as you take the time to study you'll be fine. GO TO THE SI SESSIONS!! They really do help!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2010<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My whole class probably got C's because of how we couldn't be smarter than the TA's assigned to our class. He does know his stuff and he teaches it effectively. I mean, you'll learn a lot, but just prepare to sacrifice your GPA for it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2010<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a good professor. I don't know why people say his exams are hard. He gives you very detailed notes that you can print out and follow, and he clearly tells you what will be on the exam. I never studied, missed a few classes,  and never attended the SI sessions. I got a B+</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2010<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>tends to reiterate the simple concepts and not enough the hard ones and doesnt give the best examples...homework and exams are a bit tricky. overall, a fair teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2010<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is a great professor. enjoyed his lectures very much. really enjoys what he teaches. class is hard though. grade is based on homework, midterm, and final. his tests are pretty difficult. requires attending lecture and studying. great professor though!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2009<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is up there with the very best at Depaul.

The class is straight lecture and he's very thorough.  It makes class time a little boring, but you just have to listen. HW is not that bad. I just really recommend studying for his exams.

Seriously&#63; His lectures are completely to the point, thorough and he repeats himself so people can understand him, no need for a book. Although his midterm and final are long,  he's fair, he actually grades on what he teaches.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/15/2008<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>extremely boring lecture, repeats himself constantly.

A big problem is the midterm and final consist of 90% of your grade(45 each). So if you bomb one basically your in trouble, about 1/4 the class droped after the midterm. I enjoyed his lectures and they were very interesting. If your into the subject, if you take him be ready for a challenge.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2007<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Anyone who thinks Prof. Krautmann is a bad teacher, does not deserve a college education.
