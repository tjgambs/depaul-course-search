She gives too much information, that ultimately still leaves you in the dark as far as what she wants. If you're not super interested in the subject, don't take her. You'll just wind up irritated and stressed over her huge in concise assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/24/2010<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The grades were about 10 A, 10 B and 15 C. This professor was unorganized and incomprehensible. There were 2 tests,a 12 page paper & a final. The teacher never explained what an A paper was. She expected the class to guess what ethics was and never taught it. I would  avoid this teacher. It is very hard and nearly impossible to get a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2010<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pia was the worst professor I have ever had.  Not only are her notes a mess and the class does lack clarity, but it seems that she is pushing her faith on you at times.  She assumes that all of her class believes in and loves God.  She taught us about how God's love affects us and how God's love prevented saints body's from decomposing.Worst prof</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/01/2010<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Altieri is one of the best professors i have ever had. She helped me a lot to become a better individual in so many levels. If you really pay attention to what she's saying and take notes you won't have a problem in her class. I would recommend her!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2010<br>Class Name: MGT222<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Altieri doesn't assign homework. This makes it so that you have two grades all together. So if you screw up then you screw up. She does not write in legible words but signs on the board. She does all this because she is lazy. If she cared one ounce for her students then she would write in actual words on the board.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2010<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are a concrete thinker, this course will be extremely difficult and confusing.

The class is all over the place. good luck!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2010<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Altieri's class isn't for people who want an easy A. You actually have to use your brain and work for it, but it is extremely rewarding. She's tough, but she is always willing to help. She was educated at 2 of the best schools in this country. Attend class, do the readings, pay attention, put effort into it, and you are golden. slackers beware!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2010<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this teacher has changed my life. idk why so many people have had a problem with her. Her class is not that hard. Just attend every class pay attention, and email her or ask her in class if you have a question. There is no way you can fail this class as long as you do the work. She is very nice and always willing to help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2009<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Altieri is a horrible professor. She is all over the place when she teaches. Her notes and grading system are extremely confusing. She uses numbers and symbols instead of actual coherent sentences.

No matter how hard you try you will never be able to wrap your head around anything her hampster says.  She may be a Harvard graduate, but she a complete idiot.

She crams a lot of information in every session, and still seems to have time to go off on ridiculous tangents.  Her communicating skills are quite inefficient as well.  I don't recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2009<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice lady, but really, really horrible teacher. Will send you three pages of instructions on how to write your paper, but they are so incomprehensible that you still can't figure it out. Asking for clarification results in twenty minutes of rambling with no satisfactory answer. Plus, you will be unpleasantly surprised by your grade. AVOID.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2009<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I did not enjoy this class at all and was happy to see it go.

She can be very confusing and she seems to assume that everyone is operating on her same wavelength... which is way strange.  That said, an A is possible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2009<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kind of out there. Would have never thought she went to Harvard. Always talks about hampsters. She rates your yawns, so try to hold them back if you dont like being called out in class. She is kind of scatter brained when explaining material so you have to really pay attention and come to class or you will be really lost.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2009<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bitter, confusing, waste of time.

You take away alot from this class. She is super nice! an awesome person if you get to  know her, really down to earth.

Her notes are wacky so mostly just listen to what she says and ignore what she writes. She's real anal about detail and specifics in your writing to the point of rediculousness. Overall she's not the worst i've had but if you can avoid her, do it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2008<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was kinda worried about this class when I first took it but I have to honestly say that if you pay attention and participate, you will walk out of this class knowing more about yourself and the kind of person you want to become. Professor Altieri is kinda quirky, but at the same time she is really nice and more than helpful if you have problems.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2008<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She'd be great to just have a conversation with, but her class had no structure, and she didn't even follow her own syllabus. For someone who brags about going to Harvard, she hasn't a clue what constitutes proper grammar. Paper grades may surprise you in a bad way. Don't take her if you like structured classes or if you want to learn anything at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2007<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a good hearted Prof. but in school thats not what you want.  She uses too many symbols to explain her lesson, and gets too touchy about her subject.  Its good that she likes her class but it was jus too much for me. She gives too much work,and  I would not reccomend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/03/2007<br>Class Name: REL105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take her if you are expecting a planned and structured course. I didn't really learn anything interesting. She actually gave us a survey at the end of the term asking what grade we think we deserve and gave us what we wrote down.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2007<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty much the worst professor I've ever had in my life. I'm fairly certain I'd have been better off if this course had been taught by a kindergarten teacher. At least they know how to write. She draws pictures and arows all over the board, constantly talks in circles about the same religious cliches. I'm not sure how she is a teacher at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2007<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Energetic and interesting professor. Assignments weren't bad, though the essay topics, and sometimes her lectures, were a bit unclear (she has quite a vague writing style). Still, as long as you incorporate what was dicussed in class, you'll do well!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2007<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My worst experience at DePaul.  Class =  mediocre films and books (2 Mitch Albom books!) and constantly discussing the same themes.  Class begins to feel like deja-vu - the same, unrelated lecture every day.  Grades papers based on how many &quot;a-ha&quot;s you make, not if you make intelligent or articulate points.  Avoid at all costs.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2007<br>Class Name: REL101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very nice, laid-back, and helpful professor. She is an ethics professor and, even though I took her &quot;comparative world religions&quot; class, the focus of the class was really on ethics, morals, and values of certain individuals not religions--which is my only complaint. Read &quot;Tuesdays with Moorie,&quot; if you like the book you will surly like the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2007<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's friendly and means well but that's about it. The class starts off easy (you can get away with not reading a book a week) but then it piles on and you will grow tired of a-has, unpack, and hamster remarks. Emailed reading guides make no sense. You will read at least 4 books, pdfs, 5 papers (3 in the last 2 weeks). Seek another option...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2007<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Textbook barely (if ever) used; she assigns readings and movies that you must work in groups to decifer. The whole class is based off of group work, with 3 tests. She grades hard on your writing and you must &quot;unpack&quot; everything you jot down. Also the bragging about Harvard is no lie-- she mentions it atleast once per class. She's also overenergetic</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2007<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is not an easy ride. You have to work in it, but it's not impossible like other classes.  A lot of the time you can put in your own views and opinions on the tests/paper.  She's an pretty cool prof. Readings are easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2006<br>Class Name: RELSECT<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible professor and lecturer.

She is all over the place, assignes stuff late and gives it back late (if ever). 80% of all the course work is in the last two weeks-you have to produce almost 2 papers/week. She writes numbers instead of comments on the papers and wants you to micro analyze everything. Also-she makes you watch rap videos in order to find 'deeper meaning' in them. Just avoid!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2006<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I just got my grade back for summer-I don't feel it is what I deserved. This teacher utilizes movies and TV program as though they are fact. Her exams and material are extremely simple but she grades like she's teaching neurology. This class should have been an easy A.

All she does is talk nonsense and draws animals on the board.  Her grading is insane.  She makes up all the information you learn on her own.  This class was pointless and made no sense.

Students teach the class not her because she makes every student steach the class atleast once with what she class as the daily respondent.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2005<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>just like everyone said... she writes in a very weird way... unorganized.... if you dont want to do a lot of buzy work then this is not the class for you..... class at first may seem easy but in the last 2 weeks she piles on a lot of work... papers... as well the quizzes are very hard....</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2005<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the class is simple, but she's EXTREMELY disorganized. also, pictures may have been OK in her college notes, but they're foreign for most students. means well, but needs a new job. biggest gripe = weekly reading guides. one list at the beginning of the quarter would be far more appropriate. i'm convinced she's making the course up as it goes along.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2005<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very,very unorganized....very nice and sweet but needs to be a little bit more oranized for the curriculm</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2005<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>everyone is complaining about her notes.. they are bad BUT she means well. You can easily get an A or B if you do the work (and its not hard work like everyone is saying) the quizes however, you MUST do the reading AND ITS NOT HARD READING.its short and you go over EVERYTHING in great detail in class so you'll be fine. Id take her for another class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2005<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is so weird! The class seems like it will be easy at first, but then she gives out tons of readings and hard quizzes.  Also...she grades essays with pictures! strange..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2005<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>dont get afraid about the low scores this woman has. she is easy. shes like a little kid; she draws picture on the board isntead of notes, so instead of learnign half the time we are playing pictionary. and like previously stated, if you get a tree drawn at the end of your paper, that means you got an A. shes an interesting character. i love norm</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2005<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a nice woman but I have yet to learn anything. Her notes are impossible to read and stuff we talk about is silly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/03/2005<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the note she writes on the board are in short hand or hieroglyphics, you spend 10 mins trying to figure out what she is drawing. New reading guide every week. Honestly I think she wings it each week. grades with pictures, if you like grammer school teaching take this class. SHE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO TEACH! total waste of time</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/13/2005<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>New professor...pretty cool & funny...too early to tell how the class will progress</div></div></div></body></html>
