He is a funny guy who relates well with students. The class itself was pretty easy. We watched **** a couple of times with was  interesting. The only problem I had was that he sometimes made students feel like they were stupid for not knowing something.  Other than that a great guy. Hardly any homework.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/25/2006<br>Class Name: PHYS150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Tae's class was better than one would expect from a physics class.  I learned early on that he liked to talk about the physics of skateboarding, and he demonstrated a perfect 360 flip kick during office hours.  I took him out to lunch and got a lot of extra help during our meal.  As for the class itself, if you ask questions you'll get through.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2006<br>Class Name: PHY150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Tae is a smart guy. If you attend class, you will pass his class.  If you do not make an effort to get help, you will not get any. However, when I asked him for help he was very accomodating and eager to help. Basically, if you try you will do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2006<br>Class Name: PHY200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very laid back, intelligent and great at getting concepts across.  Thought he did a great job for being such a new prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2006<br>Class Name: PHY150<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>it was a good class but if you didn't understand he gets frustrated and bothered when a question was asked. :(</div></div></div></body></html>
