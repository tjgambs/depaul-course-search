Grading-wise, pretty tough. You will read a lot of PDFs that make absolutely no sense what-so-ever and then you have to take pop quizzes and in the end you will write papers and I literally winged everything. Pretty difficult. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2014<br>Class Name: PHL233<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It seemed like the professor was experimenting with the course without thinking it through completely. He even admitted the first day that the class was going to be taught differently than how it usually was. His lectures were confusing and he was a tough grader. My saving grace were his paper re-writes. Would not take again. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is hard to want to attend. The articles we have to read are way too deep, religious, and philosophical that I have to struggle to understand. The class is spent rambling about personal problems and then we write journals about the topic. I like the professor as a person but you might need to be on something to understand the material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Zurn's class is super awkward. It's everyone getting into arguments and it is made very clear that certain opinions are not wanted which makes people not want to participate which in turn gives them a bad grade. He grades hard on the journals and quizzes and doesn't use D2L for grades. The texts are very hard to read.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2014<br>Class Name: PHL236<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Good philosophy class that introduced me to a lot of new and good ideas. A lot of assigned reading, but par for the course for philosophy. Takes a long time to respond to emails, send early. Good class with a good professor, but not great. Great assignments, but they require a lot of thought to do right.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2014<br>Class Name: PHL236<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Zurn is amazing. Class discussions were engaging and helped make the readings much more understandable. You only have to write 2 out of 4 assigned papers and one final paper. Just do the readings for occasional quizzes at the beginning of class. Would definitely recommend this class and take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Zurn is the best teacher for LSP 200 out there. He is fantastic at encouraging discussion and it is really splendid that he takes into account everyone's opinions. He is capable of making really difficult texts clear and I will totally take another class from him if I can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I personally didn't like this class. The discussions were more like students arguing opinions with one another which made for an awkward experience. A ton of reading and grades hard on journals that are due every week.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2013<br>Class Name: PHL236<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Zurn is amazing. He engaged the class in a lot of interesting discussions. The papers were not too hard, there is no midterm, and the final paper was not too hard. The reading could get tough, but he explained them very well. Sometimes there were reading quizzes, but not too often. Take his philosophy classes because you'll enjoy them!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2013<br>Class Name: PHL233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not let Perry's young demeanor fool you; he is incredibly knowledgable and one of the best professor's at DePaul. I found the papers to be difficult to write, however I learned so much from this class that I didn't mind. There's no homework, five writing assignments, including the final paper, and short "quizzes" if he feels up for it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2013<br>Class Name: PHL236<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is definitely top 3 fav professors at DePaul thus far. I used to hate philosophy and now I like it because of him and his passion. Obsessed. I need to take another class with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2013<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVE THIS PROFESSOR! He is super down to earth and relate-able. Really cares for his students. He made the class really fun despite not even liking philosophy.  He also makes some hilarious comments.  I definitely recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2013<br>Class Name: PHL233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have never rated a professor before, but I had to make an exception for Prof Zurn. I LOVE HIM!!!! He is totally cool, funny, helpful, and interesting. You will not regret taking his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2013<br>Class Name: 233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Zurn is one of the best I've had throughout my time at DePaul. He's funny, engaging, helpful, hella smart, and makes me want to get out of bed to come listen and participate.

Truly cares about what he is teaching and respects the opinions of everyone in the room. It is clear he is there to educate you not persuade you. You'll learn so much from his class, so take it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVE HIM!!

Attendance does matter, but it is worth it. A lot of reading, but it is interesting and can be applied to other classes.

I was a little scared that I would have a Bueller moment but there was NEVER an opportunity</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2011<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Love him!
