It's true that he expects a lot out of you, but he's really good in that he makes you think in ways you never would have otherwise.

He is so easy.  He talks, and you have easy assignments.  It is boring.  Just sit there, and you'll be fine.  Don't even have to listen.

For a lower level class, there is quite a bit of work.  If you can find another Sophomore seminar I would suggest taking that instead.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A hard grader, he'll tell you himself.
