Lectures were sometimes very boring, but class usually got out early (15-30 min). 4 quizzes are 60% of your grade. Final exam is 40%. The subject was interesting enough to make this class enjoyable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2014<br>Class Name: GEO220<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know what people are saying....it was a great course, good prof. Show up to class, take good notes, you'll get an easy A. Book is not needed. 4 quizzes (lowest is dropped) is 60% of grade, and the final exam is 40%.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2014<br>Class Name: PHY225<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible. His quizzes were impossible. The feedback he gave on assignments and quizzes were not helpful at all. Never responded to e-mails. Didn't take the time to ask students if they were on the same page. Do not recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2014<br>Class Name: GEO225<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The hardest class I have taken at DePaul thus far. Although the professor is vert knowledgeable on the he is awful at explaining the concepts and is constantly speaking in circles and bouncing from topic to topic making things confusing. He offers little to no feedback and what appears on his impossible quizzes are not what is discussed in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2014<br>Class Name: GEO220<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Very very frustrating teacher. Content during lectures is not tested on the quizzes which are unnecessarily hard. Does not provide feedback other than "how?" or "why?" after specifically telling the class that it is not necessary to go into depth. Not recommended</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2013<br>Class Name: GEO220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was so fascinating. If you listen and take notes in class, you will never need to read the textbook, and you will do just fine. He really knows what he is talking about and is this cute, quirky guy. He does everything he can to make things clear, and he really wants everyone to succeed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2012<br>Class Name: GEO220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Seriously guys? Goldman knows his stuff. He gives super relate-able examples of the more complicated thing he's trying to explain. No, let me repeat that, no homework. And every single thing on the quizzes and final he went over in class. He will often even tell you what you should study. Awesome non-lab for non-science majors.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2012<br>Class Name: PHY2KDF<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Goldman is the best professor I've had at DePaul thus far. He is extremely knowledgable about the course material (weather and oceanography), and he keeps class interesting because you can tell that he's interested. If you show up to class and take notes, you will do well. Highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2012<br>Class Name: PHY220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know why everyone's saying he's hard. The quizzes only take about 20-25 minutes and as long as you take good notes in class, you don't really need the textbook.  I studied for about 20 mins before the quiz/final and I got an easy A.  He's also really interesting and I felt I learned a lot.  Definitely a good class to take.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2012<br>Class Name: PHY225<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Impossible. Not cool. Super impossible. Super not cool. SAVE YOURSELVES</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2012<br>Class Name: GEO220<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a good professor but if you are not familiar with this stuff I highly suggest getting a new book that has the online feature to take quizzes and see animated examples. VERY HELPFUL!Overall, good class, good professor. If you study hard and use the online feauture you will be fine. Especially since he tells you most of what is on the quizzes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2012<br>Class Name: GEO220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His tests are really difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2011<br>Class Name: GEO220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The Ocean and Prof. Goldman are inseperable! I enjoyed taking his class b/c he showed great interest in the subject. I even thought about changing my major. However, his quizzes are very difficult and so is the final. Overall, good teacher but is extremely strict w/ grading. He is very intelligent;I like his dedication. Recom-On a scale of 1-10: 07</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2011<br>Class Name: GEO220<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was the most challenging class I have ever taken. Really brought my GPA down and I studied harder than I have for any other class. Quizzes (AKA REALLY LONG TESTS WITH ESSAYS) are 60% of grade leaving the impossibly hard final (with ten essay questions plus multi choice) 40%. Brutal. Dont take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2011<br>Class Name: GEO225<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was not at all what I expected. Most of the class lost interest because the professor goes on and on, he is clearly an expert but maybe forgets we are not. This looked like a great science non-lab requirement but it WAS NOT. Quizzes are impossible and I studied.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/23/2011<br>Class Name: GEO225<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Your grade= 4 homework assignments and 4 tests. He doesn't take attendance but you should go for the slides. If you don't go, his slides are online but not everything and you don't get the explanation. He's a bit of a tough grader, so the more you write/explain/draw, the better.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2010<br>Class Name: GEO220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Goldman is great. He uses tons of visuals in his lectures, not a lot of powerpoints, but I still left every class with pages of notes. His interest in the subject is contagious and I found myself oddly excited to learn about the ocean. His quizzes aren't hard if you go to class and he makes sure the class understands material before moving on</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2010<br>Class Name: GEO220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Goldman's great. Fast paced teacher who requires his students to pay attention.  Always got out 30 minutes early from class.  Homework assignment are easy points if you put in extra effort.  4 quizzes throughout the quarter are more about his lectures than the material in the book.  Stimulating class that got me interested in weather and climte.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2010<br>Class Name: PHY220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Goldman is a genius.  I had 0 interest in &quot;The Dynamic Ocean&quot; prior to attending, however by the end of the course I was seriously considering changing my major to physics. I learned more in this class than any other class I have taken at DePaul. Take this class if you actually want to learn something!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2010<br>Class Name: PHY225<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. Doesn't take attendence but to do well you really do have to go to the class. Forgiving grading scale.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2010<br>Class Name: PHY225<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed the class. It is difficult and he grades hard. Grade is broken down into 4 quizzes/4 homeworks/final exam. He uses blackboard, and grades exams/homework quickly. You always know where you stand. Reviews at the beginning and end of each class. We got our 20 minutes early almost every class. Not a blow off class, but not horrible to get a A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2009<br>Class Name: GEO225<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It was suppose to be an easy class, which in the end became one of the hardest classes i've taken at DePaul. He loves this subject but just lectures all class which gets students bored. Quizzes are ridiculously hard and the study guides online do not help one bit. Homework is really hard as well. He is very picky about answers. DON'T TAKE HIM!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2009<br>Class Name: GEO220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Generally a good teacher, but he grades hard. There is so much information covered in preparation for the quizzes/final, and half of it is not even seen. The study guides he provides are as useless as the help he provides when you ask a question about the test. He is extremely critical and picky with every answer. Not everyone is a science major!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2009<br>Class Name: GEO220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love this teacher! He's very clear and makes a class like &quot;the dynamic ocean&quot; (yikes) interresting! Easily the best Science teacher i have ever taken. Quizzes aren't bad, he tells you everything you need to ace them in class. Never touched the book, dont buy it. 4 quizzes and 1 Final. Easy A... not to mention his grading scale is awesome 85% = A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2008<br>Class Name: PHY225<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a good teacher but talks fast and often is unclear on points. If you study and read the book you will do well. The grading scale is awesome. 4 homework assignments and 1 final and 4 quizzes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2008<br>Class Name: PHY225<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor does not take attendance and so many students lost interest in going to his class..and in turn, do not do well. classes are straight lectures so you must take notes. grading scale is awesome but the class bored me to tears. would not recommend if you are not good at science.. you really gotta understand the material to do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: PHY225<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is quite difficult if you do not make the effort to understand the concepts.  Rreading the assigned chapters and asking him questions will definitely help. He's a very nice man and a good teacher. He has a curved grading scale which definitely helps. If you like science and weather, you will have an appreciation for this class. Study = A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2008<br>Class Name: GEO225<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yikes, signed up for this class thinking it was about Geography.  WRONG!  Its physics.  Not too hard to get a good grade thanks to the worlds best grading scale.  Not a bad class to check off a requirement with.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/24/2008<br>Class Name: PHY225<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>dear god this class is boring. i don't recommend as a summer class, you will stop going or leave after the break. he babbles on for ever. study guides aren't helpful, just tell you everything we've done in class. quizes can be hard. homework is easy. he has a weird grading scale which helps you in passing the class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2008<br>Class Name: GEO225<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Went to class half the time and still got an A-.
