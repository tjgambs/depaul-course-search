Sometime the discussions weren't all that engaging, lots of sidetracks. Reading was irrelevant. Doesn't follow the syllabus but it worked in my favor. He did feed us :) He would not be my first but it wouldnt kill to me to have him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2011<br>Class Name: SPN203<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible professor, he mocked students in front of the entire class. The majority of the time he would show up late and have discussions with one or two class members. He is also very obvious about his opinions and tries to force them on his students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2010<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>EXPLORE COURSE=Discussion was good; the novels were interesting. Midterm-5 page paper; Final-presentation and paper.Doesn't use rubrics; unorganized in what he wants on papers or projects. Went on one field trip. Doesn't like when you say &quot;what&quot; when you dont understand something.Won't tell you if you're missing assignments(even midterms).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2010<br>Class Name: SPAN105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Maya is a genuinely nice guy and is very understanding. So he's a bit truant at times; who isn't&#63; Sometimes I feel he had difficulty explaining grammar points, though. It didn't damage my grade in the course, but if you need a *lot* of extra help, you might be better off somewhere else.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2009<br>Class Name: SPN105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's really nice and understanding. He can be late sometimes but it kind of gives you some time to prepare before class especially on test days.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2008<br>Class Name: ISP6671<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Teacher!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2008<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an awesome teacher, do take him!

He just went over the textbook in class and there were online assignments a few papers and a quiz every other week. It was boring material but he tried his best to make it fun. You can get him off on tangents easily but he honestly loves teaching. I'd take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/04/2008<br>Class Name: SPAN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Laidback prof. Easy A if you show up to class and participate.  Exams were a breeze (nothing difficult about them).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2008<br>Class Name: SPN103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is terrible. Do not take his class!!! He has an arrogant attitude, allows the class to engage in pointless side conversation, and he shows up late almost every class, that is, if he evens decides to show up at all.</div></div></div></body></html>
