They're long, they're hard, and they make you really think. She's wonderful at stimulating class discussion and she's very helpful and clear. You'll get what you put into this class but she has high expectations because you can tell she's very passionate about the subject.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2014<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Miyamoto is extremely nice and fair.

It could be boring at times, as well as the readings (which I barely did). I thought she was a fair grader. I didn't try that hard and got an A, but that is how it is for all my classes here. Recommend! She is very nice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2014<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All reviews of this professor are extremely accurate. Slightly intimidating at first, but she is challenging in a way that the work won't annoy you, but rather keep you interested. She facilitates great discussion, is passionate, and is so adorable it makes me smile at times. Course was challenging and enlightening. Highly recommend Yuki.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2014<br>Class Name: REL320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is brilliant, tough, considerate, and enthusiastic.

Not only was the course material extremely challenging, engaging, and intense, but Ms. Miyamoto had always maintained an incredible perspective on it, and always give the class the opportunity to give our own thoughts and perspectives. Take this course with Miyamoto no matter what.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2013<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this class. She really wanted her students to interact with one another. The readings she assigned were really dense and long at times, but she went over them in class. Class is mandatory. She was easily accessible, a plus! She was intimidating at first but she is super funny and a great professor. I'd take her class again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2013<br>Class Name: REL202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I was super intimidated at first, but she is really sweet and is very enthusiastic about what she teaches.

Encourages everyone to participate but doesn't pry. Be prepared for a lot of readings and single-spaced writing assignments, but overall an interesting class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2013<br>Class Name: REL202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ms. Yuki is such an objective professor. There are a lot of readings, but the class discussions can't be beaten. As long as you show up and pay attention you should be solid. Interesting topic but definitely not a blow off!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/23/2013<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yuki is an amazing teacher! She went through so much information in such a short time that I couldn't imagine it, and her class made me completely reconsider my own religious and philosophical views. This woman is amazing, and I will definately be taking more classes with her in the future.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2012<br>Class Name: REL202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is amazing! I sincerely enjoyed the class. Class discussions were fun and interesting. I generally dislike philosophy/religion classes but this one was the bomb! (Literally, it was an atomic bomb class). I've learned so much in this course and from Professor Miyamoto! Definitely in my top 5 list of classes for DePaul!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2012<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall, Miyamoto ruled. She requires a heavy amount of reading, but I actually didn't mind this at all; she had us read all primary sources ranging from Aquinas to Nietzche which were usually awesome. She genuinely cares about your learning and development. Discussion is the focus of the class, and she does not tolerate apathy and laziness.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2012<br>Class Name: REL392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yuki is a genuinely sweet and caring person. I went on a religious studies study abroad trip to Japan with Yuki. She is incredibly knowledgeable and full of amazing stories and information. Pay attention to what she has to say - I guarantee it's important. She's an inspiration and an awesome professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2012<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed this class. A crazy amount of work. You will either do extremely well on the papers or really bad. Her grading is very random for what she marks down, but not that hard. She is fairly helpful and is willing to listen to you. Definitely the class to take for this section though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2011<br>Class Name: REL202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She assigns a lot of readings that are long and repetitive. And when I mean long, I mean she expects her students to read like three chapters that is 30-40 pages each. She is a funny teacher and her grading is pretty easy but the subject gets extremely boring after a while.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2009<br>Class Name: REL202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>awesome professor! the subject is really interesting, and she makes the subject interesting, as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2009<br>Class Name: REL202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>one of the best professors i have had! she is a great teacher and is really passionate on this subject. tries really hard to invoke class discussion and values everyone's opinion. around 5 short paper assignments, midterm and final paper, and reading due every class. attendance is mandatory but she uses video clips and diff. sources to help us</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2009<br>Class Name: REL202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would definitely take any of her classes again. Participate in discussions and even skim readings and you will do great. She loves big discussions that can go on for a majority of class time. A lot of writing, but totally worth it. I learned so much and it was by far my favorite class in 2 years at depaul. Participate and do the work to get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2008<br>Class Name: REL202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow-I am really sad to see such ignorant comments about Prof Miyamoto. She is a passionate & wonderful professor. She expects alot from her students but it is worth it! Group projects always suck, but her use of articles, documentaries, & first-hand accounts were very effective. Lots of class discussion to hear classmates opinions- be openminded!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2008<br>Class Name: REL202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>alot of writing and group projects. didnt really know what she wanted on assigments. avoid her !</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2008<br>Class Name: REL202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOME PROFESSOR!

She is an easy grader. Can get an A for doing nothing. She says come to every class but if you miss a couple just email her and your fine, she will say its ok.

A bit of required reading, but it's not absolutely essential to the class- helps a on papers though. Two fairly easy quizzes, two take home essays, and a strict attendance policy. Class discussions and Power Points best part of lecture. Highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2005<br>Class Name: REL201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easiest class I took at DePaul.
