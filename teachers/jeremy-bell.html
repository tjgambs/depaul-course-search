He is a fairly tough grader ONLY if you don't try on your two papers. He makes his expectations very clear. As far as the material goes, he knows what he's talking about. If you pay attention you'll pick up on some non-philosophy related stuff that you didn't know about. HATES plagiarism, and doesn't allow phones.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2011<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely kind, funny, and interesting man right here.

Choose 2 of 4 essay prompts and all quizzes are announced prior to taking them, some take-home.

He's generally pretty engaging. He basically rereads the reading assignments aloud and does a blow-by-blow interpretation. He's a very approachable guy, so asking questions isn't intimidating.

DON'T TAKE IF YOU HATE GROUP WORK</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2010<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have him for Business Ethics.

He is extremely helpful. And yea he's strict but if you respect him, he respects you. I was late one day because of the Red Line and it was no big deal. Totally recommend him. If you go to his office hours he basically writes your paper for you by the way.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent instructor.

He makes everything you need to know clear. Quizes are moderately easy, and he grades fairly. Can choose which papers to write, no major tests. He is willing to answer questions when necessary but it isn't a student-involved class which makes it easy to accidently sleep...hates cell phones and calls you out</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Modest, knowledgeable.

He is so cute which helped me stay awake in the morning. Class wasn't hard as long as you gave effort and did the assigned reading and definitely took notes.

He truly knows his stuff! He teaches everything crystal clear but is rather strict when it comes to writing papers. If you write what he teaches, then, you will be fine.

He is a HORRIBLE lecturer, seriously.

Pretty nutty about papers though.  He sounds kinda gay, but i think he mentioned his wife once.  I like philosophy a little bit better now that I'm taking this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kind of a dork, but teaches a fun class.

He's only a grad student but will explain something as many times as necessary and he will always make time for out of class help.  He teaches something until we understand and isn't concered with sticking to the sylabus</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice guy.
