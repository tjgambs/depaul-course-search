I hated doing the mymathlab, but he gives you plenty of chances to do well. He is really nice. I would recommend him if you're really good at math, other than that, find someone who doesn't use mymathlab. But I really liked him as a person!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2012<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best math teacher I've ever had, if Mymathlab marks your answer wrong & it's a not mathematical mistake he'll change it with no problem. His door is always open to students that need help & he doesn't just mark answers wrong if it's wrong but gives points for steps of the problem as well. He makes sure if a student doesn't know a problem when he's writing it on the board he'll go over it till the student does. He also drops your lowest quiz grade to try to help you out. Best math professor ever!</div></div></div></body></html>
