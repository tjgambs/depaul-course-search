If you're lucky he'll crack an inappropriate joke or two. Talks the entire time from the  powerpoints. Don't even bother buying the book or the MyLab, didn't even touch it. Everything is clear on what to expect and no surprises on the final. Quizzes are on the final so memorize them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2014<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He makes this class really boring. There is an individual assignment, group project, mid-term, and final. There are also assessment quizzes on the mid-term and final. He doesn't give out take home final like people said. This class isn't hard though if you read through the powerpoints. Everyone relied on him giving the take home final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2014<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the worst professor I've had at DePaul. He doesn't do anything to interest you in the class. No need to buy the book since he posts all of the slides on D2L. He needs to rethink how to teach MKT 301 and how to divide the points in the projects. Super boring, most of the time everyone was doing something other than paying attention.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2014<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So incredibly boring! Not clear on assignments. I did not listen in any of the classes. Do not bother getting the book. I learned nothing, but still got a high B on the midterm without studying. Passable without doing much work, but you will not be prepared for higher level marketing classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2014<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>no take home final. boring. stay away. very far away</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2014<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HE IS SO BORING. Half the time he just reads from the PowerPoint (but doesn't project it because he forgets) so you have no idea what he's talking about. If you look around the classroom either people are sleeping or working on papers for other classes. STAY AWAY.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2014<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was recommended by  many to take O'Keefe because of his take home midterm and final. However, this year both exams were in class, and difficult! I studied like I would have for any other class and ended up with a C+. He does not care about the material or his students. Better to be in a harder class with a professor who actually cares.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2013<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor O'Keefe is the man. My favorite line I have ever heard from everyone came from O'keefe: "I wish we could take our shoes off, sit in a circle, sip international coffee and talk about our feelings, but this isn't gender studies." Interesting class (however sometimes dull), not that hard and a great professor. Take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2013<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is so boring. Everything is open book take home except for the mid term, so that's the only thing you have to study for. Try to take this class with people you know because there is a group assignment at the end of the quarter, and you don't want to get stuck with idiots like I did.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2013<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor O'Keefe admittedly is very boring, but the class is pretty easy. There are 5 quizzes, a midterm, 2 easy papers/analyses, and a take home final. The midterm was the hardest part of the class, but I probably should have studied more. Take him definitely.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>5 take home quizzes. Final is take home. Midterm wasnt too bad if you looked over the powerpoints. One easy paper and one easy group project. Not too hard to get an a. Definitely recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2013<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he tells funny jokes and is approachable. do not wear hats!(he hates it when he sees anyone wearing them in class), no texting!he will call u out..midterm is hard so go over ppts, book is not needed! final is a a no-brainer, this class will boost ur gpa</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2013<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take home quizzes, 100 pts midterm (hard), take home final, 1 easy paper, 1 group paper, given for the first time. To all the comments bellow, yes he mentioned the midterm questions in his lectures. They just didn't listen. I didn't buy the book, but it is a little bit time-consuming to google the answers for the quiz and the final. TAKE HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2012<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor O'Keefe is a great professor. Mind you, his lectures can be a bit boring and dry but I would highly suggest you read before the class because his lecture and powerpoints will make more sense. The 2 case analysis are easy. Gives 5 quizzes, 1 EC all from the book and lecture. Midterm and Final 100 points each based on study guides.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2012<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great guy! Don't show up late, text, or talk during class and you will be golden. As long as you are a respectful person, he will be just as respectful back to you. He is very seasoned in the marketing field, so pay attention. Studying is required along with two case analyses. I highly recommend anyone, marketing major or not, to take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2010<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy! HYSTERICAL, great stories. Don't show up late or talk during class and you'll be just fine.

You must work a little, but there are no surprises. Take home quizzes, two reports, and two tests with automatic 10 pt E.C..  He may seem rude sometimes but only to the people who seem to  deserve it. Other than that he has great stories, opinions, and fairly laid back professor with much knowledge.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2009<br>Class Name: MARK301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is all lecture and MidTerms and Final are 100 questions. Make sure you study the book chapters and you will be fine. The Professor is a good and fair grader. If you show up to the class do your best and talk to him when you need help he will understand.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2009<br>Class Name: MKT300<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took him because I read a great ratings about him. He talks all the time, has problems with hearing so people have to scream to him. Besides, he talks about the real world which is good, but then gives us the midterm created by the department. Please, 100 questions and all of them unrelated to what he was talking about. WORST EVER!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2009<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This Prof. makes you want to avoid marketing. The concepts are easy and he makes them impossible. I'm a straight A student and received a D on his midterm. Out of 45 students 1 got an A. She swears and is negative the entire class. He is very offensive and doesn't care about the students. The guy below had it right, FIRE his butt.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2009<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The midterm was 100 questions. (less than a min per question) Most of the topics were not talked about in class or book. One question asked what the award in Japan for some American, unrelated to MKT. Agreed, this guy doesn't care about the students and in facts looks to set them up to fail. Pick another MKT Prof!!! BEWARE OF THIS PROF.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2008<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Txtbook not necessarily required for the class. O'Keefe teaches from PPs which differ from the ones he posts on BB. Extremely boring classes as he only talks to the people in the front row and students he knows.

He is a true businessman and real leader as well. He doesn't give a damn about what you feel because he is not your nanny, instead he tells you what you have to know to be valuable in the world of business. Get used to it! If you don't like it maybe you should start painting, become a yoga teacher or something in this area. Good Teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2008<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the best teacher i have ever seen, he made the final take home which helped almost everybody and got an &quot;A&quot;.do this following thing you and you should be fine...read chapter, slide, attain every class, do the extra credit, and do the papers-easy points.tests are extremely hard...final is sometimes take home</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2008<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an amazing professor.

He is a pretty easy going man as long as students respect him.  Pay attention & act interested; you will be almost guaranteed an A.  However, talk during class or show up late; he will call you out. He gives a lot of extra credit in addition to 4 quizzes, 2 papers, midterm & final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2007<br>Class Name: MK300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Teacher.
