Does not like when students do not participate. Lectures were long and super boring. I would not take a class with him again. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2015<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Goldman is very engaging and knows his stuff. His lectures are long and pretty deep, but he created an interest in Philosophy in me after taking his course. The only work you have is 3 papers spread throughout the entire quarter and they are pretty deep and are not something you can do the night before. That being said, take this guy's class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2015<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a good teacher, but lectures extremely LONG and boring. Literally goes on all class and scribbles nonsense on the board. Wouldn't recommend. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2014<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took it for Philosophical Inquiry. Avery is nice;  basic philosophy can be interesting. Lectures all class, but also encourages discussion. Reading assigned always (4 books required) and he assigns literally 5-15 pages to read (nice and short). Also some writing: two 2-page explications, one 5-page paper, and a final 8-page paper. I'd recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2013<br>Class Name: KANT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgable and passionate. Anyone who says he is boring is missing the fact that Avery loves what he does even if he isn't the most exciting of speakers. He is always willing to talk and work with you outside of class. One of my favorite professors.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2012<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far the most disappointing class I've taken at DePaul thus far. Avery isn't a bad guy but he's not a good teacher. Every class is the same: we come in, sit down, and discuss the 5 pages of Plato we were assigned to read. It's incredibly boring and no REAL philosophical inquiry occurs. Not much work involved but, but classes are painfully boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2012<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a super nice guy, but boring. Over-explains everything. Assigns readings as homework, but then goes over them in class. Longest hour and a half of my week.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2011<br>Class Name: PHL296<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Be ready to suffer with this class, it is extremely hard and sometimes he just confuses you more.  He is an amazing professor though, tough but great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good grader and very accessible if you need help with any of the concepts.  I really like philosophy, but even the kids in the class not as interested greatly enjoyed his class. Excellent teacher and guaranteed to leave you doubting the very nature of existence. Highly recommend this professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I kind of dread going to this class for some reason. He makes it uncomfortable for those people who aren't constantly shouting out all the answers in class and expects consistent participation (even if you just BS everything you say). Papers are the only assignments, no written tests. He is a fair grader it seems. Pretty good to look at, too:)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: KANT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great teacher but he has a huge head and he likes to talk a lot about hte same thing over and over again, never getting to the point. But he is a great teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2006<br>Class Name: KANT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is kinda cute ladies. He is a very good teacher, very structured class. He can be a little long winded, sometimes the answer is clearer then he makes it sound. dont be scared. one of the best teachers at depaul for sure.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: PHL200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>a very interesting class. he is very much knowledgeable. he is very helpful and encouraging. if you try to participate it will be a good class. you have to write a few papers and i found that he is a little of a hard grader. sometimes he gets quite confusing and it is sometimes hard to keep up with him. overall he is ok.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2006<br>Class Name: PHIL296<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First of all, how cute is he&#63; But honsetly, I think he makes Philosophy more easily acceptable to people like me who weren't interested at first. I'd like to take another class with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2005<br>Class Name: PHL200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i was interested in philosophy until i took this class. forget about asking questions, he answers your question with another question and or you forget by the time he calls on you. Really not much interaction, he jus talks and talks.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2005<br>Class Name: PHL200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a great man! His teaching style is what makes me want to be a future teacher. I've never had a teacher more encouraging and more accessible outside of class. All he wants is for his students to understand the material that he is teaching. Very comfortable classroom. Class breakdown: 2 text explications, 2 5-6 page papers. Very easy to succeed!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgeable, but lectures were very boring.  Tends to repeat himself a lot.  Very easy grader, just try to talk in class and he'll like you (even if you don't know what you're talking about).  I'd recommend him for higher level classes, but philosophy majors will already know much of what he'll teach in low-level intro classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2005<br>Class Name: PHL291<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Anyone interested in Philosophy should DEFINITELY take him. Very passionate about the subject. Always encourages students to come to his office and chat about the material. Only 4 short papers. A lot of reading, but it's necessary. The only bad thing is that he doesn't really answer students' questions and gets mad if you don't raise your hand.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2005<br>Class Name: PHL291<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know why there are so many negative reviews for Prof. Goldman, because he is terrific. Excellent teacher who gives passionate lectures on material that most people would rather not pay attention to, I highly recommend you take one of his philosophy classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avery was my first philosophy teacher and now I can't stop. He spends alot of time with topics in order to make the most sense of them that he can. You can't briefly skim Plato/Aristotle/Kant etc. If you need to get the requirement done, he is alot but he will be the most clear about material. He inspired me to minor and he isn't a bad grader- A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2005<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Made me dizzy with his pacing. Boring lectures. Not too helpful if you don't understand stuff right away.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>most boring professor ever! keeps his watch with him at ALL times & will talk from the start of class til the very last second of class!! covers A TON of info during class. u miss one class, you're totally lost. would not take him again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I found avery very boring, hating going to his class. I usually find honors classes really interesting but, he was horrible. He grades papers unfairly and only gives good grades to papers to say what he wants to hear. Is available for office hours. He paces and is very disorganized. Avoid Avery!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2004<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Goldman is a good teacher who truly wants his students to learn. He doesn't let any student dominate the discussion and always gives everyone a chance to speak. It's true that he paces, but I didn't mind it. He was a really tough grader, but he would always have extra office hours to help you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2004<br>Class Name: PHI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very intelligent professor,however, very boring class.

It is impossible to learn in his class because you will fall asleep guaranteed.

He is very helpful and is always willing to go that extra mile to help you. But, he does pace to much and that is annoying. The class is pretty boring and many people go to sleep. Other than that, he's pretty good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2004<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avery is a really nice guy.  He paces way too much.  It is so boring I want to die.  I want to stab myself with my pen half the time.  It is the hardest class to make myself go to.  Avery does the best he can, but there is no hope.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2004<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great prof who paces like a wild animal in a cage. sometimes lectures were boring, but comeon...its teachings from hundreds of years ago.

Kinda walks around too much in the class. Helps you after class. Easy grader, an A is not hard. Show up in calss, read the material, if not listen to the lectures, kinda borin lectures, but easy grade and free knoweldge.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2004<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>goldman's charisma and style put the rest to shame. his lectures are on point and his knowledge is primmed and trimmed. don't get mesmerized by his moves, write down what he says (for gods sake), and watch out: he moves quick. not for the faint-of-heart.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His class is very boring and dry.

Goldman talks and talks and talks, he wants people to be engaged in his class but does not let anyone get the chance. He is not a hard grader but I can say the most boring class I have ever had at DePaul</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although Goldman is brilliant, his classes seem to lack subsitence. It is more of a lecture than anything, which is ok but for the students that actually want to engage the material its not so great.</div></div></div></body></html>
