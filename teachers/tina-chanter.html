Her accent is nice to listen to, especially if you don't have any interest in the subject, which I really didn't. Work for the class was remarkably low, and grades pretty fairly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2011<br>Class Name: PHL233<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not the best professor I've ever had, but she was interesting and I enjoyed her class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/22/2010<br>Class Name: PHL290<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She certainly knows her stuff and insanely bright, but she is very difficult. I'm a philo major and have had easier classes at the 300 level. I wouldn't recommend the class, but if you're up for a challenge, you've found your class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2010<br>Class Name: PHL290<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take this class if you don't have a serious background of philosophy. The material is seriously difficult if you haven't had the experience in reading philosophy. If you don't get it at the beginning, you sure as hell won't get it at the end.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2008<br>Class Name: PHL300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tina Chanter is super brilliant and super attractive, I can't believe she has no sexy points, I fell in love with her a little bit.  She would edit our papers before hand to help us since the reading material was fairly challenging.  She allowed us to manipulate the reading schedule since it was pretty challenging.  I had a great time. FAV PROF EV.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's very smart and almost too informative.  She pounds a lot of information and expects a lot from you.  Bottom line, she's a great teacher and you will learn a lot.  Expect demanding work from/for her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked her as a teacher.  She was great at provoking good discussions/ and arguments which made the class fly by.  She makes you write a fair number of papers, but gives you so much additional resources, that the argumnets are basically established for you, you just have to find the quotes and put it in your own words.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2006<br>Class Name: PHL320<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tina is an excellent teaher, though she is better equipped to lecture in front smaller classes. If you are a good writer you will thrive under her tutelage.  I recommend waiting to take her courses until after you've enrolled in some substantial history, philosophy, and literature courses.  Paper is key, be prepared for that challenge.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2006<br>Class Name: PHL385<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very intriguing person, with an extremely quick wit.  If you like debate and argument she can throw down with the best of them.  She is a tough graDER, but mainly in matters of grammer, she is open to new ideas as long as you can support those claims.  Over all I liked the class.  She also likes interviening movies with the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tina has very high expectations.She has a british accent and probably a &quot;masters in philosophy&quot; from Oxford. Depaul hires the best. Chanter is the author of four publications. Lets face it (ISP 200) is a crappy Liberal Arts requirement and Tina purposely makes otherwise easy topics very hard to understand.Her method =frustration & failure.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2005<br>Class Name: FEMPHL<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/23/2005<br>Class Name: FEMPHL<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her lectures were engaging.
