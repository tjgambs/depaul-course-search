She often got the class into heated debates or discussions. Her sass packs a punch and you don't know whether to respect her or try to control your urge to complain to your boyfriendgf about her. Readings are long but important to passing and understanding the class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2015<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>If you study before class, put effort into your papers and attend class regularly, you will love her lectures and ace her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2014<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very passionate about her topics, knows what she is talking about. Not an easy grader, you have to at least put some effort and knowledge into what you are writing. Don't just sit in class, talk she likes when you give input or ask questions. Not the easiest teacher but if you do the work your grade will reflect that. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2014<br>Class Name: 103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Calvente is so smart!  Challenging but fair.  She really did changed how I looked at the world.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2014<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>If you're looking for an easy A, find another class. If you're looking for a way to challenge yourself, critically think, open your mind, and actually LEARN take this class. It was a bit challenging at times, but rewarding when you look back on how much you got out of the class. Professor Calvente is extremely intelligent and is there to help. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2014<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She expects a lot but will really change how you see the world. She challenges you to think critically and her course is one that will stay with you when it's over. I'd recommend her and take her again. You have to do the readings and go to class though, and participate, if you want to do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2014<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Calvente is a great professor.  She is direct and passionate.  I'm taking here now and she takes a bit of getting used to but so far I'm enjoying her honesty! She is tough though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Calvente was a wonderful professor. She kept the class engaged, & made sure you were comfortable to share your thoughts on the topic. Brilliant woman, is passionate about the topic. The class is semi-tough. I took it as a freshman, and I passed. Highly suggest taking CMN 103 (Intercultural Communications) YOU WILL LOVE IT. I did... so unexpected.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2013<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Calvente knows what she is talking about and that is refreshing because some professors just touch the surface when they talk about social justice and race.  She rocks! Lots of theory.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2013<br>Class Name: COM103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While the class is theory intensive, Dr.Calvente is so smart and really knows what she is taking about. If you take the time to do the readings and seek help you will succeed. I seriously recommend her if you want a different look on everyday teachings and life. GREAT professor! She really is what a college professor should be like!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2013<br>Class Name: INTC308<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is brilliant!

Her class is based mostly on theory, but extremely interesting. Focus, participate, and ask questions. She's changed the way I look at the world, which is more than i can say about most other classes here.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2013<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm taking Dr. Calvente now and she changed how I look a things.  Yes the class has theory but its worth working through. I wish this class was longer.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2013<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Calvente is brilliant!!  If you are serious about learning take her class.  it will change how you look at things.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2013<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Highly recommendable</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: INTC308<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have taken multiple classes with Dr. Calvente and have enjoyed every single last one of them. She is an amazing professor and I would definitely recommend Dr. Calvente because she is one of the few professors at DePaul that actually challenges her students to think more critically.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2013<br>Class Name: CMNS509<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Calvente is BRILLIANT. All of the negative ratings are probably due to the fact that, unlike most professors at DePaul, she challenges you to stretch your mind, develop critical consciousness, and challenge the status quo. And yes, that requires THEORY and group discussion, not PPT slides. I've had multiple classes with her - highly recommend!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2013<br>Class Name: CMNS509<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unprepared for class, wastes a lot of time, overload students with work & seems to get pleasure out of stressing students. She doesn't prep you for the reading or explain important concepts. She doesn't want to help in her spare time & can be down right cold. Her discussions are good but doesn't like to work behind the class time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/17/2013<br>Class Name: CMN135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lisa is the smartest person I know. She makes class interesting by making you use your own critical thinking skills and open discussions. Was one of my harder classes, but she is always willing to help and make any more clarifications needed. Highly intelligent, I strive to be like her. There needs to be more teachers like her in the world</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2012<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very difficult course.

She is very old school and loves to lecture. No powerpoints or writing on the board. If you ask her to repeat something, she doesn't remember. She is stuck in her ways.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2012<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't. Do. It! This class was awful and incredibly hard. ALLLLL THEORY BASED, NOTHING ELSE. She's so intimidating and not helpful if you don't understand something. It's a straight lecture too, no power point, no nothing, just her, standing in front of class, talking...not interesting what so ever.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2011<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>THEORY INTENSIVE CLASS! DO NOT TAKE IF YOU'RE NOT INTO GOING OVER HOURS OF THEORY! And I got an A out of the class but it was hard work....</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2011<br>Class Name: COM103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE HER!! class is about theory, and she is unclear on expectations, grading is impossible. avoid at all costs</div></div></div></body></html>
