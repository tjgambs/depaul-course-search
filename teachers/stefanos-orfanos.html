Tries to be funny, isn't really that great. He knows what he's doing. If you try hard enough, you can get the A. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2014<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Orfanos is hands-down the best! He is clear, always willing to help, and is overall a great teacher. He grades everything quickly, and is definitely a fair grader. He posts summaries after each class of what we covered in class, and his handwriting is beautiful!! He has a nice sense of humor, and is very sweet. Highly recommend him! :-)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2014<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy. Kinda funny but gets the material across. If you don't understand, just go visit him, he'll help. Homework is crucial to the class. You MUST do homework to understand the material. He's a good teacher but sometimes his clarity isn't the best. Def recommend him if he's your best option.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful professor! Even though I ended up getting an A-, the class was a lot of work. The prep for midterm was harder than the actual test as well as the final. Homework is very reasonable, 9 problems per class which is taken for points. He is always available before class and office hours to help with any struggling.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>beside the fact that it's math, and I don't like it... This man literally made class go by so much faster! He is nice and funny! He usually sets a time and a day just for your class and you can go every time you need help! I recommend him!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/25/2013<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I do not know what some of these ratings are based on b/c this prof. Is amazing! He is funny and makes class totally enioyable. He knows the material and goes out of his way to make sure that everyone understands what he is teaching. If you thought he expects you to know too much then I don't know what you were doing in your prev. math classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2013<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, does everything he can to help you succeed.  Very patient, always at office hours willing to help, responds to e-mails quickly, grades homework/exams extremely fast.  I was expecting much worse when I read his previous reviews, luckily he was much better.  Funny guy too, which is a bonus with a subject that can be tedious.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2013<br>Class Name: MAT468<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy knows how to confuse you, explains the materials in a bad way and chooses the easiest part to teach & give examples about & leave the rest hard part to you. All he cares about is to cover as much as he could. Mostly he treats you nicely but expecting you to know everything about the course even before you enrolled in class. Avoid him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2013<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The professor knows his material and never looks back at his notes while giving lectures. Funny and nice, but he challenges you outside of class. Class examples are understandable, you struggle with homework, and then you struggle even more with midterm. Unless you took Stats before, I don't recommend taking him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2013<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His clarity is not the best but he does everything he can in his power to get his students to pass. He started the course with a 10% curve. He then curved the midterm 6%. And then he added a 7% extra credit assignment to your over all grade. So pretty much if you did the extra credit, you could have had a 53% and still passed with a C (53+7)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2013<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Seriously the worst professor.  He makes the material so much more confusing than it needs to be.  I would have done so much better had I not gone to class and learned the material on my own.  Do not take him if at all possible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2013<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is very helpful and his grading system is super easy! He even gives partial credits even if the answer is not right for a question. Try putting in some effort and you can pass with a better grade than expected!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2013<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very knowledgeable and makes sure that students understand things before moving on. He likes it when you ask questions. He has an accent, but it doesn't hinder your understanding at all; it actually makes it more interesting. He's very organized and neat (esp. handwriting), and he cares about his students. I strongly recommend taking him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2013<br>Class Name: MAT260<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is hard, but this was expected so no blame to him here. However, his examples were very simple. It's like he did all the addition problems and expected us to do multiplication in the tests. His lectures weren't all that clear and his accent didn't help. Sigh.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2013<br>Class Name: MAT260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Orfanos was very entertaining. He is open to change when persuaded and when it is reasonable. He is very attentive to his students need and was always available for help during his office hours. He is very knowledgeable and it translated well. I would recommend him to anyone who needs/wants to take a Math course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: MAT260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an extremely helpful teacher! If you are confused about anything, he will throughly explain it to you in his office hours.  He has very neat handwriting and has a great sense of humor.  He gives lots of examples and his exams are based off of homework.  Go to class, do your homework, and the quizzes and tests will not be too bad, but study!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: MAT260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great professor with a funny sense of humor. He keeps the class interesting and he is energetic. His handwriting is extremely neat! He is helpful if you don't understand something.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2012<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man has no idea how to teach. He is good at Calculus but that is about it. Not being one of those kids pissed because my grade sucked but this guy is actually really BAD AT TEACHING. DO NOT TAKE THIS MAN.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2012<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's tough. Hard exams, difficult examples and hard to understand. He was also rude when responding to questions. I'm happy this was my last calculus class at DePaul.</div></div></div></body></html>
