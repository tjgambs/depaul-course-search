He only talks about the Fed policies.  He does not tell you how the curves apply to the real business world.  My only &quot;C&quot; in my transcript</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2011<br>Class Name: ECON509<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Strauss brings great perspective from his experience and work at the FRB of Chicago, however, it's the only perspective he gives. Be prepared for a &quot;the Fed can do no wrong&quot; angle during discussions. Lectures can be overwhelming in terms of the amount of content he covers. Not the easiest professor but I did learn alot and would take it again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2011<br>Class Name: ECON509<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Strauss knows what he's talking about.  He's a senior economist for the Chicago Fed and has some interesting insights in the rare times that he goes on a tangent.  One problem with the course is that trying to fit an undergraduate minor in Macroeconomics into one quarter means it goes at super fast pace. Very interesting class all in all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2011<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredibly intelligent and incredibly dry. Reads verbatim off of the slides provided by the book. No curve, no extra credit, no fun. I would recommend avoiding Strauss if possible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2011<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He does not encourage questions/discussions in the class.  He reads from the slides and does not provide real examples that relate to the current economic environment.  I am retaking the class with another professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2011<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'll start by saying Strauss is VERY impressive. He's a senior economist at the Federal Reserve and is a prof at U. of Chicago. The guy knows everything there is to know about econ. Very lecture/powerpoint heavy. Requires large, group report at the end. Fair grader. Take if you'd like a challenge. Hard but I enjoyed it. Def got my moneys worth.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2010<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Strauss is very accomplished in the world of economics and brings a lot of stories and anecdotes to back up the readings.  If you read the chapters, pay attention during the lectures, you should have no problem.  The tests were fair and he allows 1 3x5 notecard.  Great class and professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2010<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The guy has a really huge knowledge. Lectures are fast and difficult, sometimes you need to read some additional material from the book to understand the whole concept. If you like economics and challenges you will love his class:) I would recommend it to my friend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/29/2010<br>Class Name: ECON509<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have almost completed my MBA program, and I have straight A's and 1 C.  The C was in Strauss's class.  I would advise against taking this teacher.  Lectures are boring and minute to minute, his tests ask &quot;small detail&quot; questions rather than bigger picture questions, and he's boring.  Hardest and worst class I've ever taken.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2010<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Strauss seems to lack the desire to conceptualize the subject matter in a way that encourages questions or discussion.  If a question was posed his response was snide and condescending which was a huge road block for classroom discussion.  He made many comparisons between Booth students and Kellstadt students which illustrated his believe tha</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2010<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor I have ever had.  As everyone already mentioned he reads from his slides.  The part that really bugged me the most about him is that when you ask him for guidance or help he says &quot;oh I went over that in the first class.&quot; I would recommend you do not take this class, unless you enjoy cruel and unusual punishment.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2010<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bill is very knowledgeable about economics but a very awful professor.  For the midterm/final, he offers no bit of help as to what to study.  His lectures are useless also as he just reads over 100+ slides per class which are not even his own and simply reprints from the book.  For the group paper, no guidance about the grading criteria was given.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2010<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Strauss is VERY knowledgeable in economincs, very intelligent and this class is valuable. He lectures STRAIGHT from power point. Test are MC and Essay, MC are pretty basic, essays are tricky. If you can learn on your own you dont ever need to attend class, just print out the power point.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2010<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is horrible.  He does not prepare for class, all he does is show up and go through the powerpoint slides that were given to him by the publisher of the text book.  If you enjoy sitting through 100+ powerpoint slides each night, then this professor is your guy.  His tests are very difficult and he tries to trick you as much as he can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2010<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Leaves much to be desired! The actual exams are not difficult, however with no guidance of what to study and 125 powerpoint slides per class, it makes the exams a bear to study for! Attendance is not necessary considering the slides are &quot;read&quot; to you in every class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2009<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ECO 509 could be a very difficult course, but Strauss's exams are very easy.  If you read each chapter one time and review the notes before the midterm and final, you'll be fine.  I agree that 100 powerpoint slides per class are boring, but they are extremely helpful to help you study for the exams and they eliminate the need to take notes in class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/21/2009<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting subject, but a really hard class!  He knows what he's talking about, but he goes through about 100+ slides per class, which isn't the best way to learn.  Don't bother with the book.  I used mine to study, but it's not necessary.  Tests are really hard and the curve sucks.  Know the graphs!!  He tests them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2008<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>EXIT this class. Walk off the STAGE. Leave any way you can, LEFT or right.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2008<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He definitely knows economics, but his teaching methods leave something to be desired.  Buying the book was a complete waste as he posts all of his notes on Blackboard.  His tests were fairly difficult, but his curve made 85-ish an A.  He's not the best professor I've had, but he's certainly not the worst.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/31/2008<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interesting class and he knows the stuff cold. Tells great illustrative stories about the topics. Very fair grader and the tests were average difficulty. I recommend taking him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2007<br>Class Name: ECON509<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The problem is that he presents the material, he doesn't teach it. Anyone can flip through a 120 slides and tell you whats on them with no depth. Which he does btw, and its unbearable.  There is no ability to explain the concepts in a well thought out manner in order to help the class understand the concepts. Test questions are tricky... avoid!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2007<br>Class Name: ECON509<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Read Straight off of notes for every lecture. Doesnt give the scale for his class EVER.  Tells you the class grades the standard deviations and then tells you wait till you see your grades online to see what you have when he posts them to university.  Take someone else for 509 hopefully someone who atleast lets you know where you stand in class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2007<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor I have ever taken - reads directly from 120 slides each class.  Exams are a nightmare.  He is no help if you ask...DO NOT TAKE HIM</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2007<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Strauss is very smart and hi credentials are impressive, but his ability to teach is extremely weak.  If I had to skip a term to complete my final class just to avoid him, I would take the term off to avoid being in another one of his classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2007<br>Class Name: ECO501<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Has impressive credentials, and clearly knowledgeable, but does not deviate from prepared PowerPoint presentation.  Be prepared to fly through around 100 PowerPoint slides and countless formulas each class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/02/2007<br>Class Name: ECON509<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very technical and smart professor, keep up with the readings. Tests can be tricky, but if you understand the concepts, you should do ok.</div></div></div></body></html>
