He will force you to learn the material or you will not pass. Expect to read at least 100 -150 pages a week. Expect quizzes in almost every class. Attendance is mandatory.  Participation is necessary, but if you do not understand something he will take the time to explain it. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2015<br>Class Name: INT205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>I wasn't participating much in the beginning.  Professor Morales-Pita pulled me aside and told me he was going to call on me more.  That scared me, obviously, but it actually made me prepare more thoroughly for class, which in turn got me a better grade in class.  He cares and will do what he can to help you succeed.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2015<br>Class Name: INT205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher!

Very smart man with a lot to teach! Top 5 professors at DePaul! He is a sweet old man who has a lot to teach! The class is a lot easier if you do all of the readings assigned.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2012<br>Class Name: INT205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AMP has a different teaching style, but its one that is suited to learning this. He makes you think, trying to get you to think through a problem and attempt to answer rather than just sitting and listening. Pay attention, read the ppts, and show up to class! He's super sweet and funny, and quite helpful if you ask.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2011<br>Class Name: INT205<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class by nature is difficult, but the prof. is very excited to teach it. If you read the powerpoints, talk in class, and study- you will be fine. He loves economics and knows a lot about it, he's very nice, too. Attend class and make an effort, you will do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2011<br>Class Name: INT150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took this class for my modern society requirement. It ended up becoming my favorite class, he taught me all the basics to economics. Very passionate, personal and qualified professor. Loved going to his class and the class discussions. Recommend you take this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2011<br>Class Name: INT150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a good teacher! He's so passionate and it makes everything easier to understand and fun. I learned so much! As long as you keep up with the reading, you'll be fine. Definitely recommend anything he teaches.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2010<br>Class Name: INT150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very smart and caring individual.  I never bought the textbook because he just writes everything on his powerpoint slides.  Only homework is to read his powerpoints off of blackboard and the 2 study guides.  A midterm, final, and project are the only real work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2010<br>Class Name: INT205<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He cares a lot about his students doing well, but does choose favorites. has inaudible one-on-one conversations with his pets to answer their questions. accused me of not coming to class when i asked a question about a quiz (i have prefect attendance). i want to like him because his intentions are good but it's such a frustrating class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2010<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He picks favorites in his class and if you are not one of them he won't help you very much.  He seems arrrogant and talks about Cuba way too much. He is hard to understand and can't explain the concepts very well.  He does not like it if you don't understand something the first time. I got a B in his class but I had to teach myself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2009<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really good guy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this as a night class which, in retrospect, I think was a mistake. I pulled off an A, but I had to study for the midterm/final. He focuses more on understanding the reasoning than memorization. He's a good guy, economics is tough to do once a week though. Overall, pretty good class and decent teacher I think I have to take a again and I'm not too worried.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2009<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is kinda tough but study and pay attention! He goes fast but if you read the material before hand and study afterwards, you will do fine. The midterm and final were pretty easy if you study. Attendance is mandatory and he does not curve grades at all. You need to do a quiz online for every chapter you cover.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor! You have to work hard in his class, but you will understand the material if you do the work. He is very committed to his student's success, and quick to respond to email. He is sometimes hard to understand, but teaches the material very well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm pretty neutral on Professor Morales. He is funny sometimes and does truly love economics. I thought it was awkward the way he would call out people for doing poorly in his class, though. It just made the whole class feel uncomfortable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ambiguous questions on his daily quizzes with seemingly arbitrary answers; questions often had two answers very similar to each other which were each technically correct; i lost attendance points for missing class to attend my grandmother's funeral</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He really wants people to engage economics. Always there to help, won't let you sit in class and say nothing. Makes you work for your grade, so it isn't a blow off class. Yes he has an accent, but you don't have to be Cuban to understand what he is saying. He wants you to learn and does everything he can for you to do well, recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2009<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He WANTS you to understand the material, he really does-but you probably won't. Hes very knowledgable but he just cant explain it well. But he LOVES when you ask questions- There are a lot of extra points that can raise the midterm and final you bombed (weekly quizzes, seminars, attendance) I really didn't care for him overall though</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2008<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an interesting character... MAKE SURE to do the online quizes it really adds up in the end... He is strict on attendance and being on time... He tells fun stories and if you bring up cuba he'll have something to say... overall GREAT Professor I'm taking another class with him next semester!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2008<br>Class Name: INT150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Morales Pita is a great professor, although his accent seems like it is a problem, he takes the time to speak clearly and consisely in Global Connections. He is very helpful and keeps the class interesting with his stories about Cuba and other places he's lived. He also tries to crack jokes which makes the class laugh. :D</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2008<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can get past the accent, but can't get past the very mandatory attendance policy just to have him leave the class to a student to teach the week before the final exam. He missed a lot of classes and was confusing in lectures. If you're weak in econ, try taking Miller instead.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/29/2008<br>Class Name: INT150<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He really knows his stuff. A lot of his knowledge comes from personal experience, which makes the class interesting. He expects a lot from you, but if you make sure to come to class you won't fall behind. He has a very strong accent. That just makes him memorable=)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2008<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>&quot;To do well on the tests you must Ahhhh-Study&quot;                         hahaha,this guys preety smart, the only thing is you MUST attend class, &quot;To miss class is a sin&quot; He has too many random russia/cuba stories. Chances are youll get a B</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2008<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's really funny and is willing to help you if you need help.  He really does try to be a good professor. I  liked him, but he's not easy either.. You have to study and really pay attention.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2008<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The Bad: He's a little hard to understand. Attendence is VERY MANDATORY. You'll get called on often.                                                      The Good: He will actually teach you things about real micro. Hes a funny guy. And as long as u come to class, and study for a day for each test you'll do well and leave knowing more about econ. A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2008<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>To the previous poster, you must be a real slacker to have done that poorly on such an easy exam. Or maybe you are just plain, er, ah, how do I say this in a nice way, dumb&#63; I am glad you dropped the course. Now us serious students won't have to waste time with you whiny types.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2008<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>do not take this class. i left with a 28%. he told us that over half of our class failed and we did better than his other class. he picks favorites and they will all pass with flying colors...everyone else is basically screwed. i didn't miss a single class and it didn't help at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2008<br>Class Name: ECO333<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a joy to be in his class! It takes a lot for me to like a professor, and he's done it! Very knowledgable, adorable old guy. His class is very interesting and he's actually quite funny! Myself and some other students actually wrote a letter to the department recommending him to teach more classes. Got an A in the class, just do your work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2008<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor dedicates all his time to making sure that everyone understands and is involved in class. The material is well explained and the tests are more than fair. For those who do not attend or don't listen, then they cannot comment as to his quality. A great professor, easy to understand and very helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2008<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Did not understand much of what he said, huge language barrier.  Rambled about how he conquered Fidel Castro yet we weren't able to pass his exams. Believe he projected his personal struggles on the class by ensuring the course would be near impossible to complete successfully.  2/3 of the class failed and had not choice but to drop out</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2008<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>not recommended. Half of the class withdrew and most that stayed ended up failing. He seemed to play favorites and a select few got good grades. I studied and put effort into the class, but his tests were rediculous and he doesn't grade fairly. If you like economics, he is very passionate and knowledgeable, but if not, take someone else.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2008<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a great professor, he may be hard to understand at first all you have to do is listen and come to class!! Its very important that people remember this is college not high school you must put forth effort to get a good grade i did and I got an A and it wasnt hard</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2008<br>Class Name: MICRO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For anyone who doesn't like coming to class...don't ...he's very clear on that.  Attendance is mandatory and makes up part of your grade.  These other comments are completely false.  I took him for Micro and Macro and he is one of my favorite professors.  If you get to know him and study out of class and understand the concepts you will do fine.  H</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2007<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First of all let me say that the negative comments about his English is just plain ****!!! He does have an accent but so does a lot of other professors. He is very intelligent and he is passionate about his subject very approachable always willing to help. But you have to do ur part come to class and study. I got an A cause i paid attention!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2007<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very passionate prof. forces you to learn whether you like it or not. he will randomly call on everyone to answer some of his questions. and even if your answer is right but not perfect he will shut you down. which is good but gets annoying fast. his exams are pretty tough they do not entirly correlate to the lectures and i kno econ well too</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2007<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very intelligent and demanding professor. People need to stop complaining about college being difficult. He has really high standards, many kids dropped after midterm which is 35% of grade and almost no one got and A. However, not impossible. If you like econ and are good at it you can get an A. Highly recommended for serious students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2007<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably one of the worst teachers that I've ever had. He is enthusiastic but he's incomprehensible. I had to struggle to try and understand what he was saying, and by the time I decoded it- he moved on to something else. He often tries to talk about Cuba and sell his book, which have no relation to the class. Good class, good book, terrible teache</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2007<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very passionate about his work. he tries to explain everything clearly, but most times, its better to zone him out, and just read the book. tests are heavily weighted on essay, so make sure you understand the concepts. overall, not too bad, could be better.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2007<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Morales-Pita gives good examples in class and is fairly organized, however, expects his students to know a lot about economics prior to the course.  Be prepared: he calls on people at random to &quot;summarize&quot; what he just said.  I really didn't like being put on the spot, but he does give extra credit opportunities.  He is ok in general.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2007<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want an easy A, then take a different professor.  If you want to learn important economic ideals and be prepared for the business world, then take this guy.  Even if you are a non-business mager, he really makes you understand economics.  He is a little difficult to understand, but you'll get used to it.  I still remember what he taught me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/21/2007<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>wow (in the worst way possible) okay if you get a poor grade on your mid term drop the class even if you tells you to stay. I and many other people stayed bc thats what he advised and we all FAILED. I now not only have to retake this class, but also have an F on my transcript.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2007<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's not really too bad, but I think non-business majors had a harder time in that class. 40% of your grade is attendance at his &quot;seminars&quot; so that totally will inflate your grade.  I would take him again, but I wouldn't recommend him to non-business majors.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2007<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So I posted the evaluation below. I was not doing very well in the class so I asked him to help me out..and he wrote me the nastiest e-mail in the world. Obviously he doesn't care about the students who are not into economics or don't 100% enjoy his class. Again..if you are not a majour RUN fast. P.S. His accent is hard to understand.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2007<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think that if you get econ. concepts very easily then this guy is your man. He is clear in that respect, however when it comes to the non-majours..run as fast as you can. He teaches in a way that assues that you have prior econ. knowledge. Doing the study ques. are useless and the seminars are free points..find another pro. unless u r a majour.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2007<br>Class Name: INT150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy, great teacher. He is VERY passionate about what he teaches. Always kept my attention, and wanted to see everyone in the class do well. No written homework. 1 project, required readings, but they arn't that bad. Probably my favorite teacher at DePaul so far.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/06/2007<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a nice guy and a good professor but... I get econ very easy and thought I could teach the class. Towards the end of the course, due to the lack of homework and practice, I relaxed too much, got a C on the final - ended up with a B+ in the class. He knows his stuff, lectures are clear and interesting but needs to start assining actual homework</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2007<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is diffficult to get used to, but after a few weeks it got more clear. The midterm and final arent impossible, but you have to study a lot for both. Do the online quizes they really help you prepare. Overall a good professor. He wants you to do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2007<br>Class Name: ECON315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teacher that I know. He cares about his students so much. He will explain you whatever you dont understand until you can explain it to him. And if you study the seminars before the exam you should be fine. And I took Macro 106 and it was the same thing so take him awsome professor....</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2007<br>Class Name: INT150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really good professor.. Loves what he teaches and is good at it. He's cuban so he puts alot of personal information in so you really get an idea of how things effect countries.. I enjoyed his class and I would take another with him. I learned alot..

Class is only discusion, but make sure you read up before the class.  Mid-Term is based on Quizes on the website, and final is not comprehensive.

He has this &quot;seminars&quot; and you get your points for just being there, what you do is basically review for the exam. His midterms in MICRO and MACRO and right off the quizzes online so if you do those you are good!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2007<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Whoever is trashing this guy is crazy.  He's not arrogant, he's proud to have survived a tough life as an immigrant.  He's actually a very easy grader, and had I had a B+ for most of the class.  He cares about you and will always try to help you.  I reccomend him with flying colors; you won't regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/30/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He knows what he is talking about but unfortunately no one else does. Read the book!!! do the practice quizes online and you will be ok; If you listen to him, you will ONLY get confused and get lost in concepts which are easy to understand as long as he doesn't explain them. Don't argue with him, it will do u no good.I highly recommend against him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took him for 105 and taking him for 106. He knows the material inside and out. Midterm and Final count for most of total grade and he attendance counts for the rest. He is a sweet old man and his book is very good. I recommend this class to students who have a good work ethic and are smart--not for those seeking an easy A and are lazy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am not one to **** about professors here at Depaul but this man is completely unclear, arrogant and one of the hardest graders I have ever had.

First of all he tries to make everyone buy his book.  Second of all, if you want an A, honestly good luck.  He does not give any partial credit and his final is a lot harder than his mid-term, so if you get a good grade on the midterm, dont think you definitely have an A (that's what I thought).  95 is an A Its hard</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2006<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably one of the best professors I've had at DePaul so far. He goes out of his way in order to help his students understand the material. He is very smart, and has ALOT of credentials (just google his name). Get on his good side, participate in class, ask questions when you don't understand and you will do just fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible Professor...grade is based off semianrs..midterm...final!! Midterm few pass..doesnt curve because he thinks that nobody tried but its really because he doesnt know how to teach. Needs to stop thinking he is better than everyone else and start teaching. Never will meet with you outside of class because it is not worth his time. Do not Take!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Usually people who say &quot;worst professor ever,&quot; probably didn't put enough effort into the class, but this man was impossible.  He is un-sympathetic and unfair.  The mid-term was ridiculous with few people passing.  Micro. should be the easiest subject, but he makes it more difficult than it should be.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Morales-Pita is the best.  He is a man of passion, and it's quite obvious he has a passion for teaching.  He explains economics extremely well, and will continue to go over something until he is sure it is understood by everyone.  He wants to be there and makes me want to be in class too.  A man of rare intelligence and class, he is a pleasur</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher!!  He really goes above and beyond what any other teacher does as far as explaining the material.  He cares about his students and wants to give them all A's.

The guy is really smart, and you can really tell he loves this subject.  I will probably take him for every Economics class I have.  He also wrote a really awesome book about his journey from Cuba.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2006<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The comment above is right....he seems like a nice guy....but he is not. His tests are vague so you have no ideas what he is going to test you on. ..and when it comes to grades he is horrible...he will not change anything and he is extremely rude as well. I had a horrible experience with him and this was just a summer class! DONT TAKE HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would recommend students to take as economics professor.

Truly cares about his students, will stop at nothing to make sure everyone understands. He posts all the notes on Blackboard and although your grade is 2 tests and participation, the tests arent bad if you pay attention in class and at the review sessions, 'seminars.'  One of the best professors I've had, worth the trip to the loop!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2006<br>Class Name: MICRO<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tough in the fact that you only have two tests to make your grade.

I wish i would have taken him first.Such a nice man and is highly intelligent.

Will stop to make sure everything is understood.  Very thorough in his lectures.

But by taking good notes and attending class you can do well. Sit in front of class and make sure he knows your name. It's in benefit to you that he does!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2004<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring as hell. His lectures do not go with what he puts on his tests. Has a thick accent that makes it hard to understand sometimes. One Final and one midterm which makes it okay i guess.

He loves teaching so much.  He is funny in his own way, very cute in a grandpa kind of way.  His class is not hard.  He takes attendence, but it counts as a good part of the final grade... It is possible to get b's on the midterm and final and an a or a- in the class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2004<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this guy, yeah he has a thick accent, but he is an absolutely adorabale old man, a good, funny teacher, just go to class and pay attention, you'll be fine.
