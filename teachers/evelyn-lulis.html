She really understands the field and is willing to help. I went to her several times and she had quick, helpful responses. The class isn't easy, but I learned a lot about the frameworks. Do the reading. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2015<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The first couple of weeks of this class is frustrating and intimidating. Once you actually get what she is looking for and understand the class, it'll be a least a month in. After that its a lot of weekly assignments, weekly labs, and participation. You'll definitely use the book for this class, its essential! Work hard, and you'll get an A or B  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2015<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>By the time you realize what she really wants you've dropped a letter grade. Assignment rubrics are unclear and she assumes you know what she wants. She doesn't really teach. Forces participation. No electronics in her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2014<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>If I wrote this at the beginning of the course, my rating would have been lower because I was always a little confused. As the course went on, what she expected became more clear. She's a passionate teacher who cares about you having a system to evaluate ethical dilemmas in real life. I think I'll always have Kant and RuleAct util. in my head now.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2014<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>The ethical frameworks were barely taught to us. We were expected to learn them all from a handout and example. We did not know what was expected and got docked points for our assignments for doing it wrong when she did not really teach us how to. All the assignments were repetitive. She seems lazy to teach and very unorganized </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2014<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a decent teacher teaching a dry subject. Evelyn knows her subject, and does her best to foster interest in her students. She is a reasonable grader, and tends to be down to earth about class expectations. Not a bad choice if you need to knock out your ethics classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2013<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't really know why everyone is complaining about her. I don't care about technology, ethics, or what the course is about, but I got an A on all my assignments. The labs are easy A's, just copy paste from text book and cite. She was super nice to me, and quickly responded to emails. I didn't participate and still got an A. It's not hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2013<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Lulis is just okay, she definitley seems very very open and respectful to students needs and what they want in a class. She always asks opinions and has you take a survey in the beginning of the course about what you expect out of a class/teacher. The class seems repetitive however and the labs are tedious. Grading is strange. No midterm.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2013<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take her for LSP121.  She seems nice enough but is confusing.  She takes stupid points off on assignments and doesn't know how to explain the material.  Two people actually got in a shouting matching in our class because they were so frustrated...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2013<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is god awful, I did not learn a thing and she is not helpful at all. You do stupid labs every week where everyone basically fails because she is so strict yet does not tell you what she expects on them. Avoid her at all costs!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2012<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's quite awful at teaching the material, I haven't learned a single thing. Hard to pay attention because I never know what she's talking about. Makes the class a lot harder in that way. Take a different professor for this class!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2011<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was an OK professor, she definitely wants you to learn the material but really wasn't available for office hours and her response to email questions always came days later. Class was interesting and I enjoyed it but she definitely didn't prepare you for the midterms and finals.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2011<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mostly an easy class, but didn't like her. Takes points off for stupid things, contradicts herself, and hires crappy graders to grade other stuff who suck as well, taking off points for very dumb reasons, then she supports their decisions to do so.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2010<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>enjoyed class and lectures. If you have a problem with her it is ur fault. sounds like an angry student being angry</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2010<br>Class Name: ETHIC208<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I see many of these ratings that sound like they are trying to change our minds and were written by a press agent. Hmmm who would doctor a eval like that&#63;                                                             I found her difficult and confrontative. . .  all the time.  I lIke the subject, but not the method.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2010<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TAKE CLASS! Couldn't disagree more with 2 evals below. She is kind,  respectful and open minded. She plays devil's advocate, but I never heard her express her own opinion. she challenges you. I struggled in the class, but she spent hours outside office hours helping me. I took another ethics class and didn't even cover the philopshy like she did.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2010<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While the class is an easy A, Professor Lulis does little to aid her students in attaining any kind of knowledge from her class. While she clearly is extremely intelligent, she lacks open-mindedness and teaching skills. Even though I got an A, I regret wasting my money on this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2010<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TAKE THIS CLASS!! it was interesting and the teacher was very respectful and helpful. It  helps to go to class, but u don't have to. she teaches how to think not what to think. Can be a hard grader, but it pays off in the end. Also, I am a better writer becasue of this class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2010<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had a great experience! She is so nice -- the nicest teacher I have had at DePaul. Problem must be with the writing tutors -- I do not think she uses them anymore -- we did not. Interesting class. Hard grader for the papers, but made me learn the material for the final. If you go to class, you can do well. Very intersting class activities.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2010<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I completely disagree with the posts below! The class was interesting and fun. She was always excited about the material. I hardly miss class and understood the material completely. She was very helpfull and alway there to answer questions. VERY fair grader. If you come to class and do the reading you can get a decent grade. She made me think.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2009<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I completely agree with the two postings below, this teacher is absolutely terrible. She is extremely incomprehensible, as well as an unfair grader. She is lazy, she approaches class as if it is a chore, and shows no interest what so ever. She would hardly qualify as community college material. DO NOT take her!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2009<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As lazy as she seems about the class she teaches (and she barely does that), she just LOVES to nitpick the hell out of your grades, and dock points for idiotic reasons. Made us use writing tutors, and then docked points because I followed something my tutor told me to change. When questioned about it, her reply was &quot;he made you do WHAT&#63;&quot; Avoid her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2009<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO not take her...She is on a permanent power trip. I dont know if it is because she doesn't have anyone to boss around at home but she always makes you feel like she is sooooooo important. She Grades terribly. Always has a very anoyying awkward lauph after everything she says. Overall she sucks!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2008<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she does a good job. i did not expect to enjoy the class, but did very much. she teaches how to think, not what to think. i was worried about my grade and gave a a bad CTI eval, but didn't need to be. she sought me out, spent time explaining things to me and i did well. i should go to the head of CTI and say how good she is</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2008<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher; never missed class. she was always respectful, kind, helpful. if you do not do well in her class it is your own fault. she hardly uses powerpoints, but does use the socratic method. by the end of the quarter, she knew everyone's names. i know a few who gave her bad review they were angry because they could not understand the materil</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Please just dont take her, for your own sake. Thats all I have to say. This is the first time I will be meeting with the head of the CTI deparment because she was so bad. Not helpful, very rude, makes you feel like an idiot, even though you are prob. right.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2008<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great! Honestly guys, she's very  smart, intelligent, and understanding. I will keep taking her classes. I feel bad that she had to teach a stupid class.

Can't type and used notepad to write in-class programs, so the majority of class was spent debugging her syntax errors. Email communication was a joke. Asking her for help on anything was like pulling teeth, would often accuse you of not knowing the material when you asked for help...what's the point of asking&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2007<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is pretty boring, but it is very easy. She can be a tough grader at times, but she also gives a LOT of extra credit. The final was very easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2007<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's GREAT!!! Really loved her. She is really smart and really funny. She is also very understanding and treats all her students like people. Your writing will get better too!! If people don't like her it's only because they must have not gotten a very good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2007<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not that hard of a class, but I have a really big problem with her because she is a java professor, yet acts like an english professor. She makes us go to the writing center, who says a paper is well done, but she disagrees and will not budge. Grades based off of grammer and how well you write overall instead of content. Very annoying, do not take.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2006<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>overall easy class. the prof has her days. one day she is super nice, one day she is driving everyone insane. she was really nice, and tried hard, but i felt like i was in high school again, so i will not be taking her again. not worth the frustration.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2006<br>Class Name: HCI440<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was very hard, but teacher was very good at explaining things.

However, if you want to learn something outstanding form this class, don't expect from this one.  I mean prof has a great attitude to the topic but all she thought you can &quot;read it yourself.&quot;  Also she has problem to explain/ clarify sometimes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2006<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lulis is hilarious! She was an okay teacher but the work was really easy. Take home midterm and final,  If you do the work (which is very easy) you should get an easy &quot;A&quot;. She even said the first week of class that no one has ever gotten lower than a &quot;C&quot; in her class. You should like your Chances and take her class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2006<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know what people are taking about when they say her CSC208 class is really easy.

Only class I never ditched! Class was very interesting and fun; concepts were hard, but she explained them clearly. I learned more in this ethics class than I did in other ethics classes.

While easy, she is one of the least intelligent teachers I have had at DePaul and I learned next to nothing from her.  She may be good as a programming teacher of some sort, but do not take her for Impact of Computing Technology - a class more suited for someone in social sciences.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2004<br>Class Name: JAVA<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best teacher i have ever had!!!
