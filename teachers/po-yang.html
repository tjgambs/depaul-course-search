Her quizzes and exams are straight-forward extensions of the homework. Her drawback is she doesn't field questions asked during lecture well. Otherwise, she's great!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/04/2007<br>Class Name: MATH453<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Quizes everyweek plus a final.

It is mandatory for grad students in math and all sections seem to follow the same syllabus.  Her quizes/test are straightforward, neither hard nor easy.  Her only real weakness is her accent, which is thick but understandable.</div></div></div></body></html>
