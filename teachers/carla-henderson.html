For the exams, basically know everything on the powerpoint slides. The midterm was much more difficult than the final. She is nice, but could never understand anyones questions and ended up having them repeated many times. For projects, take down everything she says to do. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2015<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really easy class.

She is so nice and fun each lecture was entertaining. The course contained 2 quizzes, midterm, final, and group project. Don't buy the book everything on the tests comes directly from her slides. She makes everything clear to you. Would definitely recommend her. She curves test scores a lot. Let's you out early</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2014<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Carla's a great professor. Don't believe the other reviews. You don't need the textbook and she is super clear as to what she will ask on the midterm, quizzes, and final. It's very doable and very managable. She is a great lady that has a good sense of humor. She can be sassy but students are often annoying in the manner they ask questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2013<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's such a nice lady! The class is not exactly hard, you just have to really study the study guide. 2 announced quizzes, 2 excel 1 access projects, 1 easy group project, participation and attendance count. If you're not familiar with excel and access, come to class on the day she shows you how to do it! Don't buy the book</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/03/2013<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was eh....A lot of potential to learn a lot in this class, but she is so focused on stupid definitions that are not applicable in 2013 for technology. Like was is floppy disk still term she teaches? Wish I could have learned more, but I basically relearned excel tricks I already knew. Also, do not buy book, her powerpoints suffice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2013<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT BUY BOOK. Carla creates great power points, which are the only thing you need to get an A in the class. Carla is very bright and makes class exciting. This material is not an easy subject, it takes memorizing the slides to get an A, but everything you need to know to get an A on the quizzes and tests is given to you through her lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2011<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is so rude, she needs to be more patient. I went to her office twice and she was so annoyed. Your job is to help us thats y we are paying your salary lady</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2011<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is awesome.  The class is tough.  I'm guessing those hatred didn't do very well.  She practically gives you the answers from her study guides and is funny.  Don't be fooled MIS is a hefty class.  She made it easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2010<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lousy Professor, favors woman and she reads this. Maybe now she'll know we all hated her. Avoid her if you want to actually learn.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2009<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is very easy because she teaches straight from the powerpoint slides. You are not required to get the book which is awesome.  But, she is not the brightest teacher.  Take her if you want an easy grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2008<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is so mean. She picks up little mistakes. Never use textbook. I have chance to an A, however I got 2 out of 10 pts of participation pts even I attend every single class. It makes me got an B-. I hate her class. A lot of work load.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2008<br>Class Name: ACC503<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wouldn't recommend this class, however the material is easy. The problem is that the tests can be tricky. You need to study EVERYTHING from her Powerpoint presentations. We didn't use the book so that was a total waste of money. Had projects every week which counted for 20% of grade. Good thing is that you always know where you stand in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2008<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mrs. Henderson is pretty good.  Don't listen to other bitter classmates on this site.  I reviewed study guides and notes . . . and got a B+.  She's very good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She does a good job at keeping you into the subject matter.  She also uses stories to help reinforce the complex content!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2008<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't buy the book..waste of money! She is unorganized, and grades very hard. There are 4 projects in this class. First half of the quarter is confusing, but afterwards it gets easier...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2007<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is AWESOME. As a student at DePaul for the past 5 years . . . I haven't had an instructor that was this interesting with LOTS of stories to tell about the material.  I personally want an instructor to teach from the notes so I know what to study; not those that expect me to GUESS about the TEST!  Excellent JOB!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2007<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Carla is a GREAT professor.  I appreciate an instructor that can present the material and relate it to a real setting.  Overall, excellent job at making a required course interesting and useful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2007<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So shes late to class 10 minutes everyday and you cant reach her outside of class.  But, if you print the handouts she gives you and study them, you will get an A. She nice and kinda fun and crazy.  Not very reliable, but her class is easy.  If you dont get atleast a B, its definitely your fault.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2007<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>most of class is common sense.  she does not compromise on grades.  rather easy but tests can be tricky.  don't buy the book!!! she uses all power point slides.  i read only the first chapter  and got a B</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2006<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First--DONT BUY BOOK.  she teaches from the powerpoint handouts.  She is hard to reach if you have questions and she is also very unprepared.  But its a easy class and if you have some knowledge of MIS, you'll get and A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2006<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT LISTEN TO WHAT EVERYONE ELSE SAYS!!! Carla rocks my socks!!! She is AWESOME! So easy. Seriously, if you don't pass her class, something is wrong. Everything comes directly from the slides, and she's super funny. Class was very interesting. I loved her. I wish I could take her for another class!  No need to buy the book! Thanks Carla!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2006<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Use a good piece of advise: do not take her as a teacher for anything. She is by far the worst teacher that I ever had. She is a mean person, very arrogant, she takes time off for herself and she is very hard on grading. The quizes are just as hard as the final, and she will kill you with group projects. She is a very bad choice for this calss.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2006<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class, thinking that is an easy one, like everyone said. Well, she makes it look like hell. She's killing you with an tone of work projects, in teams, very very very hard exams and quizes. It is a killer. Do not heve her as a techer, she is gone kill you, flat out. On the top of everything she does not know how to teach. She is bad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2006<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I never thuoght that I will have a such bad teacher. She doesn't know much, she doesn't know how to teach and on the top of all she is such a hard, tough grading teacher. If you diserve a A, trust me you will get a C, or a -B at the most. Clearly do not take this teacher for any kind of class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2006<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OK, Listen flat out this is the worst teacher ever. She will talk about her kids, her dog, her husband, her father teaching her to still when she was little, anything but something usefull that you can learn. People, seriously it is gona be your worst nightmare ever. She is very very very hard on grading, the class is boring, and she's bad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2006<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring class, boring material and as much as she says she has years experience in the field, well, it doesn't show. All of the examples she uses are from the text so if she really has all of the experience she says she has, why isn't she talking about that&#63; Nice curve though. Boring power point class. Not too hard, but there are better options.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2006<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>THe class sucks but it's not the professor's faults... easy quizzes and tests.. provides study guides so there's really no excuse not to get an A.... curves and really looks out fo reveryone in the class.. A+</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2006<br>Class Name: ACC503<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>People are being way too harsh...her class is laid back...you always know where you stand and you always know what is expected on projects,tests,quizzes,etc</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2006<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The teacher is not totally to blame for the suckness of this class.  Part of it is that this class is the most pointless, remeidal waste of money I have ever experienced. Carla does not make it much better, though she does try. The projects are pretty easy but her tests are ment for photographic memories and she grades based on her mood.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2006<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are not an MIS major do not take her for this class.  This class is required for commerce students, yet she makes it very difficult. Also, when she hands back grades, she does not put a single mark as to why you may have not received full credit.  She just pulls a number out of her head and writes it on your paper.  Very boring class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2006<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This instructor is a little slow... She knows what she is talking about but can confuse the mess out of you. Plus she is condescending, and the sound of her voice can be a little irritating at times. I would only take her class if all the really good Profs have been taken already.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2005<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>CLASS IS NOT THAT HARD, BUT SHE MAKES IT HARDER THEN IT SHOULD BE. PROJECTS ARE EASY AS LONG AS YOU FOLLOW HER CRAZY DIRECTIONS WORD FOR WORD. SHE IS IN A BAD MOOD ABOUT 90% OF THE TIME.  CANCELS CLASS A LOT. SHE IS ALSO BIG ON GROUP PROJECTS. OVERALL NOT THAT BAD OF A CLASS.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2005<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is really no stress. Projects are easy. There is a quiz which is kinda hard, the midterm is the same and the final is SUPER EASY. The test questions are created from the powerpoint but she can be tricky!!!! Good class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2005<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's not hard. As long as you go over the powerpoints, follow her instructions, you'll be fine. Projects are super easy. Its not neccessary to get the book either. I would take her again. She's easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2005<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Way overrated, doesnt respond to emails, 5 projects, quiz, midterm, final, rattles off mass info at end of class to get through, not nice to students, always sarcastic</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: MIS<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is such a ****. she is very inconsiderate and also unorganized. she doent know half the stuff she teaches herself. she would fail her own midterm.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2005<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is also listed under McKenzie.
