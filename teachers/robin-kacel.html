Very helpful.

This class is demanding and you put a lot of your own time to do the work. Professor is helpful and she is very flexable with each student, however, you have to show her you care and want to try to get an A. But if your up for a challenge take this class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kind of stupid teacher. She is very passive aggressive and class often feels like a complete waste of time. The assginments are easy and the tests aren't horrible, well unless you hate writing. If you don't write well, she will be kind of cruel and unfair to you. So try not to suck.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was really nice, very flexible and helpful. She really wants her students to do well. The readings were interesting, and the grading was pretty easy. I would reccomend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2005<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great professor. Very helpful and motivating. She takes you step by step to achieve good writing skills. She is charismatic and funny. She is NOT boring and she is not strict or mean. People should appreciate good professors like her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She LOVES the mediocre.  You read pointless, high school level stories.  She once said that she graded a paper based on the motivation she thought you put into it, rather than your actual talent.  If you are intelligent, then this is like banging your head against a brick wall over and over again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class started out very interesting with great literature to read and intellectual class discussions.  Then suddenly, Robin got obsessed with this &quot;essay structure&quot; crap.  It turned into a class that I just wish would've ended sooner.  Nice lady; annoying teacher...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor.
