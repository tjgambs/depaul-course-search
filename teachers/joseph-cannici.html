Final exam was tough and the information was more than human ability to cover. on-class final exam was bad decision from JEO. do not expect me to save hundreds of pages in my mind.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2010<br>Class Name: TDC425<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors I've had. Makes dry material as interesting as it can be and is very thorough. Homework was fairly tough and exams weren't easy, but you're allowed notes. If you're willing to be a good student, you'll do well and learn a ton. If you're looking for an easy class with little work, don't take it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2010<br>Class Name: TDC425<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very rigid especially to distsnce learning  students. For example, Joe will not share comments on midterm and final on COL for DL student and will require you to visit during office hours. Get serious Prof. If I can visit depaul campus why would I take DL course</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2010<br>Class Name: TDC425<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is good technically but very bad academically</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2009<br>Class Name: TDC425<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Joe is very knowledgeable in subject area.

This is supposed to be a basic survery course, but in reality is loaded with a ginormous amount of useless content.  Homeworks/media reviews are easy.  The exams were entirely retarded though.  There were too many questions that weren't even covered in class.  Whatever.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2008<br>Class Name: TDC425<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good at explaining concepts.

The subject is pretty boring, but he makes the class fun with his occasional jokes and stories. Grade based on midterm, final, 3 HW assignments, and 5 Media Reviews. The final and midterm's are a bit difficult, the rest is easy. I would take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2007<br>Class Name: TDC460<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Homeworks are easy.

His class structure is very easy.  5 1-page media reviews, 3 HW assignments, midterm, and final.  The HW and media reviews can be done anytime prior to the due date.

If you don't, definitely recommend going to class and asking questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/11/2007<br>Class Name: TDC460<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really enjoyed taking his class.

GRADING IS HARSH and there is TONS of information, so much so that we normally go a few minutes past the time class is supposed to end.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/22/2006<br>Class Name: TDC425<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent instructor.  Extremely enthusiastic about teaching and helping students learn.  Makes every effort to be clear in his instruction and explanations.  Easily one of the best I've had had at DePaul.  Highly recommend him.  Course was interesting - I had no prior background in  Voice/Data Networks but now have solid fundamental understanding.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2006<br>Class Name: TDC425<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The material is dry and boring, but he manages to make it much less dry and boring.

The material was dry as a bone and he had about 100 powerpoint slides he went over each week in class.  I was totally tired of turning in homework every week.  If you are really into voice and data take this class if not you will die or boredom.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2006<br>Class Name: TDC425<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cannici is an AWESOME!!! professor. He makes the class be alot of fun. Gives very clear lecutres and will pin point exactly what to study for the exam. He lets you use a one sheet of paper with notes.

Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2006<br>Class Name: TDC460<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really good professor. His class is a piece of cake, but you must know something about the subject before you take the class. Grading is really good. Take his class.

I didn't think the class was too hard, but it is not a subject I am interested in at all.  His test are fair and the media reviews and homework assignments are very easy.
