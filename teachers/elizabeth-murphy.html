Either Prof. Murph really stepped her game up or there are a bunch of whiners on here. The class itself is without a doubt challenging,  but Prof. Murph sets you up to win. The homework load is a bit large, but it makes the exams cake. Prof. Murph provides you will a million avenues to succeed. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/23/2014<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's really good at teaching. However, she seems rude sometimes. She gives a lot of homework but, it helps in exams.

I took her over the summer which we only had 5wks learn the material. This class is challenging but she offers minimal help, a ridiculous amount of homework due before class and just reads off the power point. I would strongly suggest NOT to take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/02/2014<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a horrible teacher. She is very rude to all her students. She almost made a girl cry during class for asking a question. You pretty much teach yourself the entire class. I would highly recommend getting a tutor if you must take her accounting class. You need the book for her class and cengagenow.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2014<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a nice woman and all, but she does not know how to teach. Basically, it's learn on your own and spend 8 hours per homework assignments (they're online- and they're HORRIBLE!) Don't take her, unless you're okay with your GPA plummeting!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2014<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: C-</div><div id="right"><div>The class was extremely hard! Yes, you have to work hard and stay on top of the material however the homework web site always had typos and errors. The midterm was far too lengthy, I couldn't finish it within the hour and a half time limit. She wants to challenge you regardless of your final grade. Avoid if you can find a better professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2014<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Murphy is an excellent professor!  It is a VERY hard class but of you are genuinely interested in learning the subject then this is the class for you.  The tests are difficult but she prepares you really well for the exam.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2014<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard subject. My criticism is that she uses powerpoint too much (we can just read it at home on d2l) to teach class rather than demonstrate difficult problems on board. Also, the constantly due online portion was a disaster since some problems didn't work and it was basically a guessing the right answer game to try and get full credit for most.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2014<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is very hard! She wants to "challenge" you in class but I didn't want to be challenged I wanted to  receive a good grade. Midterm was easy but too long not enough time to finish it. Final was doable but alot of material to cover. Make sure you dedicate enough time for this class. I kept up with the hw and stil struggled.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2013<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The material is difficult but she has her own way of teaching it and makes it achievable. Lots of HW and a tough midterm and final. The HW is very helpful for the exams. Take this class when you have the time to dedicate and you will do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2013<br>Class Name: ACC545<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The tests and materials were very hard, however if you put in enough study time, you should be fine.

She knows the material but has no clue how to teach it. Becker does a much better job at teaching consolidations. I don't think she has ever taken a teaching class because her methods are more complicated than necessary. She should could learn a thing or 2 from the guys at Becker.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2013<br>Class Name: ACC545<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>really hard course.she makes it even harder. Too much homework and projects. It takes you a whole week to be well prepared for her course in next week and a whole week again to do the homework. Then you get a B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2012<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Everyone saying Dr. Murphy is a bad teacher needs to get a clue. This class' material is incredibly difficult. Dr. Murphy tries to make the material as intuitive as possible, and is an outstanding teacher. Follow her outlines and process charts she uses extensively in class, they are essentially what the tests are made up from. Great teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2012<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Big misconception: THE MATERIAL IS HARD, NOT THE PROFESSOR. This class is NOT for slackers and those who like to "just get by". You will have to work for your grade but it will be a rewarding experiance. I was working full time & took her for the summer session and still pulled off an A-. Great professor who likes to prepare you for the CPA.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2012<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredibly hard grader.  The projects you have to do in the first half are incredibly hard compared to what she shows in class.  Doesn't follow text book then tests from it.  Doesn't explain/go through a single problem in class.  Has it all pre-setup and done in excel files and doesn't explain ANYTHING.  Stay away if you want to keep your GPA up.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2012<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is not a joke. It would be a much better class if the teacher wasn't horrible. The projects are pretty insane takes students on average approx. 6 hours. Mid Term & final are super hard. She prepares you for one thing and gives you another.. She'll teach in class how to do something and you feel confident & then proj. is a differe</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2011<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had her over the summer. Really straightforward class.  Either you take the time to learn it or you don't.  Her tests weren't bad at all, as long as you did the online hw and went to class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2011<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is difficult -- study. She's tired of students who expect to be given good grades for breathing. Majority of the grade comes from the first half of the quarter; ace those projects. (As in, start them more than a day in advance.)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2011<br>Class Name: ACCT545<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The professor had accomplished the stated objectives of the course in a POOR manner.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2010<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was like a rollercoaster ride and it end with derailment. Projects were like the hardest thing. The instructions are completely not helpful. She knows her stuff but does not know how to teach. SHE DOESN'T CARE! Office hours= why are you here, my test are not hard, it's exactly the same. It's incredible crazy this class. It's horrible!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2010<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst Professor I've had.  She is very educated but has a VERY difficult teaching method.  The consolidation projects take HOURS and HOURS (took me around 30 hours total) to do and she is very unclear with the instructions, which gets very frustrating.  I would not recommend this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2010<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>RUNNN!!! midterm was 3 hours. did all my homework. did extra problems in class. i got to see all my other classmates taking it again next quarter. never EVER had i ever had to retake a class before this.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2010<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is by far probablyctge best professor for ACC 308 at DePaul. The material is hard and she does a good job explaining the material. If you keep up with the lectures in class and put forth time studying you will do good. If people are looking to slack off then this class isn't for you. Her tests are extremely hard and you can't study for them the night before the mid-term. Just do as she says and you will be good. Overall, nice professor and has very good teaching skills.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2010<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the worst accounting teachers. the class consumes your life and the midterm is 3 hours and the grades are just above 60%. she is of no help and a poor choice for a professor. DePaul can do much much better than her. I waste of my time and money.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/20/2010<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>THE WORST professor i have ever had for an accounting class at Depaul....we never get anything done in class just her yammering on about herself, her stupid consolidation projects are pointless and we get no real guidance on how to do them....just awful. :(</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2009<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice teacher. I took ACC-101 during the 5 week summer session. Tough, tough course for me. Don't take this class thinking you will get an easy A, because you won't. I worked super hard and still was dissapointed with my grades Oh well, I tried hard. Other students were getting A's.

Tough instructor.  Not sympathetic but does explain things well.  I worked harder in this class than any other in the MSA program.  Keep up on the big consolidation projects.  The book is useless except for the multiple choice problems.
