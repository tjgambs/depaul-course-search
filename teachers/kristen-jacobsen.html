However, this does not mean that this class is easy. Get ready to do many multiple page homework assignments, and to work your ass off for the final project. Great professor, hard class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2014<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I Love her! Just Pay attention in class and it is an easy A!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2014<br>Class Name: HLTH202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't recommend her. I think this class could be easy or hard if taught by different people. She's a nice person but I think she is a very hard grader for no reason. This is a beginner research literacy class and she's handing out ridiculously low grades for article critiques, which add up in the grade. Don't do it if you don't have to.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2012<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take her.  She doesn't know what she is talking about.  Students correct her.  Disorganized teacher.  Tutors told me that the department chair tells her not to use particular examples but she still does, and often the date for them is wrong.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2012<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I LOVED this professor! She had a great sense of humor and if you respected her, she respected you. She is VERY particular about homework, but it's only a big deal if you make it one. NEVER be late or you will regret it. Also, NEVER text or she will kick you out. I found her to be fun, helpful, and nice. She made the material less dull.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2012<br>Class Name: LSP218<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Exams are hard and disorganized and  confusing.    She forgets to explain things.  I would not recommend her if you really want to learn anything.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2010<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kristin is by far the best professor that I have taken at DePaul to date. I am an English major and hate math. Which is why I am so glad that i had her because she knows how to make it easy for everyone to understand. G to EVERY class. Lots of info that in every class that you wouldn wanna miss, however, she does review. Great teacher!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2010<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's the best. I'm horrible at math so i'm glad i took her. she's a big girl but is hot</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2009<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SHOW YOUR WORK she gives partial credit. She is a good teacher and very helpful if you have questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2008<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kristin is awesome! She explains very well, her notes on her website explain things step by step. You should go to every class, as there is alot of information that is given out all quarter. She follows her syllabus to the T. There are Homeworks, Partner Activities,Project,a Midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The class is alot of work but easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's really good at explaining math concepts to those us of who aren't math-brains. She is strict on certain things but she makes it clear beforehand, so there are no surprises. I'd definitely recommend her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2008<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kristen is an amazing teacher. She is so nice and is always there to answer questions. Only 5 homework assignments per quarter! You only get homework due once a week and she is a very easy grader.  The data analysis project is a lot of work, but Kristin is very detailed about what she wants you to do! TAKE HER CLASS!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2008<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>In actuality, she is a really nice teacher.  She has online notes that you can follow off of, and she is stern with what she has on her syllabus.  As long as you stick with that, you will pass the class with flying colors.</div></div></div></body></html>
