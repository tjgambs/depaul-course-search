Marla is a tough but fair grader. She expects the best out of her students and challenged them to get better every class. If you want to go into journalism, this is a good challenge. Or it's a good way to weed out those who aren't sure what they're going into. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2014<br>Class Name: JOUR390<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I've learned more from her class than any other journalism class at DePaul. Anyone complaining is clearly just not ready to put in the work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2012<br>Class Name: JOURN377<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class involves a lot of writing, you'll have a lifestyle story due each week.  Marla is a tough grader but fair.  She knows her stuff so this class will definitely make you a better writer.  No quizzes or textbooks required, BUT get yourself an AP Style book, you'll need it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2012<br>Class Name: JOUR510<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredibly arrogant and thinks she invented journalism. Clearly picks favorites and if you're not one of them, you're out of luck. I've have a 4.0 in journalism and yet she feels the need to constantly give me B's without any explanation whatsoever. She is unclear and unhelpful. I would not recommend taking any of her classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2011<br>Class Name: JOUR278<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have been an A student my entire time at DePaul. However this professor has chosen that I am NOT one of her favorites & I continue to get Cs on all assignments that I spend 12+ hours on. Ive had 2 meetings w/ her & she gives me no reason for why Im getting the grades I do. Dont take this teacher if you dont plan to suck up for higher than a C!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2011<br>Class Name: JOUR374<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>would NEVER take a class with this professor again. not a nice lady and she clearly picked favorites. did not get anything out of this course; it was very repetitive and boring. if you enjoy writing about your community over and over again, i highly recommend this class. otherwise, take something else that is worth your time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2009<br>Class Name: JOUR279<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Journalism class so obviously it was a lot of writing, but a lot of it was in class.  A couple out of class assignments which made it difficult without much notice.  Good teacher.  Would take again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2009<br>Class Name: JOUR279<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Krause is a great professor.  She stresses in-class assignments to expose students to writing on a deadline.  Interesting assignments, sweet lady.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2008<br>Class Name: JOUR275<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok overall.  She gives grades without much reasoning as to why she gave you the grade.  Clearly plays favorites.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2008<br>Class Name: JOUR275<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would never take her class ever again.  Too many assignments/activities crammed into each class, without a clear focus.  Assigned readings not very helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2008<br>Class Name: CMN245<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her for a night class and it was pretty dull.  She isn't a bad professor, just not super engaging.  The class was easy but pretty self-led. didn't use the textbook, only the AP stylebook.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2008<br>Class Name: CMN275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher! You will get good experience and feedback and you will learn a lot.  The class I took was CMN 275, so we wrote a lot.  It was great and she is the best! Sweet and friendly and definetly understanding.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2007<br>Class Name: CMN275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take her class if you can. She's really nice and helpful.  Come to class and make sure to ask questions if you don't get something or do it wrong and you'll do great. She's nice and laid back and I had fun in her class. She'll help you and you'll learn a lot.</div></div></div></body></html>
