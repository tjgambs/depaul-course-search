Prof Foster made his assignments very clear - there would be three modules to complete every week for three weeks. There were multiple readings and one or two quizzes for each module. Readings are sometimes long. If you actually do the readings, it's really easy to get 100% on the quiz. Don't slack.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2014<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok, but didn't learn as much as I thought. A little boring. Pretty easy, though, so that's good. His bark is worse than his bite. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2011<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One quiz at the beginning of every class, with the lowest two scores dropped. Watched a movie every week and had a one-page paper due the following class with the lowest three scores dropped. Seems to be a hard grader on the papers at first, but once you get used to them you can get all A's. You MUST read and participate though!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2011<br>Class Name: HIST288<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took class during summer, MUST do the readings. There is a quiz everyday before class that weighs a solid amount in your grade. Readings are long but easy. Class discussions reflect readings, it can get dry at times but he keeps a boring subject interesting.few papers required but nothing stressful. Easy A if you pay attention and do the reading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2011<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Every class begins with a quiz on the reading which can actually be tough, even if u read. Heavy reading, also a one page paper due each week on a film analysis. You wont get a 100% on any of them, he doesn't believe in a perfect paper. 5 page paper for midterm. than you add 5 more pages for the final for a total of 10 pages. Clear on his expectati</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2011<br>Class Name: AMS275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Every class begins with a quizz, must do the readings to be able to pass. However the questions are super easy. His lectures are not boring at all and he knows how to make them relate to every day life. Midterm is ok and final paper is easy. Take him if you can, he's awesome!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2009<br>Class Name: AMS275<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! Interesting class. If you do the readings, you will do fine on the quizzes and he drops your three lowest quiz grades. The final paper is the only bad part of the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2009<br>Class Name: HST275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors I've had at DePaul. Very helpful, very knowledgeable and very interesting. Overall, he makes you think. Quizzes aren't bad if you do the readings. He's very interested in student feedback and wants you to do well. Loved him and loved his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2008<br>Class Name: HST288<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the coolest profs. ive ever had.  Attendance isnt mandatory but you have to go in order to do well on the quizzes.  Classes can be a little dry, but its history.. 7 quizzes on in class reviewed readings.  He takes only your best 5. Two easy papers.  Overall learned a good amount and he is an easy grader. If you go to class, easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>REALLY REALLY EASY B class or EASY A class.  Attendence not required although going to class will get you an A.  I didn't go to half the classes still revievid an B.  NEED to be an absolute idiot to recive anything lower.    NO MIDTERM OR FINAL just 12 one page overviews and he grades only top 8 reviews.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2008<br>Class Name: HST288<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is really nice, and the class is really laid back. Lots of class discussion on the readings, so take notes! Quizzes are 75% of grade, but they are pretty easy if you study. Small 2.5 pg paper and journal entry. Attendance isn't mandatory. Overall, easy and interseting class, and really cool guy- I would definitely take him again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2008<br>Class Name: HST280<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>his class says &quot;attendance not mandatory&quot; but... the quizzes are based upon in-class lectures.. oh.. and the quizzes are basicallly your whole grade</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2008<br>Class Name: HST275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Foster is an intelligent guy, and the material is interesting if you're open to learning about very &quot;Different&quot; stuff. Really easy, take notes on what he says in class. You cannot do well if you don't show up. Great class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2008<br>Class Name: USHST<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No final, no midterm..just quizzes and he drops the lowest score. 2 journals and 2 papers that are 2 pages long. Pretty easy and good class. The only problem is, he doesn't explain what he wants in the papers and assignments and the quizzes aren't that easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2007<br>Class Name: HST275<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interesting material... lots of reading, however. GO TO CLASS, take notes and pay attention to discussions. A quiz every week or so and all the questions come from the discussions of the readings. Small research paper, quizzes, no midterm or final. Clear explanation of material. Recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2007<br>Class Name: HST275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor provides a wonderfully constructed syllabus and sticks to it. He is very organized and helpful. Quizzes are easy if you do the reading, if you don't..he knows. Professor is understanding that this isn't your only class and tries to accomodate accordingly. Very friendly and passionate about the subject material. Fair. I learned a lot!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2007<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Go to all his classes or he will make sure you can't get an A. He gave me an 89 even though I got an A on everything I did in his class.I cut some of his classes so he punished me. The material is joke. I think I lost I.Q. points just by showing up for the ones I did.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I learned absolutely nothing in this class. The prof. isn’t very good. The class was supposed to be history of women but was far from it. We were either reading about men or about some fictional character that didn’t even exist. The prof. claims there isn’t much history for women, perhaps he needs to take a class before teaching one. I actually fel</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2006<br>Class Name: HST280<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am a huge fan! Super clear and easy format, but still really interesting class. He is so nice and helpful and his quizzes are pretty easy. More people came to Fridays in this class than i have ever seen. He really grows on you. I wish I needed more history so I could take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2006<br>Class Name: HST275<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really great professor who truly is passionate about what he teaches.  The material is all really fascinating and an interesting way to look at how history was shaped by sex. He does have weekly quizzes, but if you come to class, even having not read, you can get the notes and do fine on the quizzes. plus, no attendance policy! aka:take him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/03/2006<br>Class Name: HIST431<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting, intelligent, readings for course were varied from excellent to ehh. Prepared and interacts with students in class as if he were a student as well, learning as much from us as we from him, but that is not meant in a negative way, meaning he interacts with students well in the classroom and does not dismiss them out of hand, will take ag</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: HST275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class, great prof.  Easy A, especially if you show up for classes.  The class was one of the most interesting I've taken at DePaul.  Highly suggested.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2006<br>Class Name: HST275<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Foster is a good an easy professor. He gives eight quizzes and drops the lowest grade. The class format got boring at times, but it was still okay. He is kind of hot; but I don’t know girls, he seems gay to me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2006<br>Class Name: HST275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really enjoyed this class. The reading assignments were interesting and class discussion was entertaining. You must read everything he assigns though, otherwise you wont do well in the class. Definitly the best way to fulfill your history requirement! He's kinda sexy too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2006<br>Class Name: HST275<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>8 short quizes and he drops one at the end. No attendance required but it helps to go if you choose not to read. A lot of reading, but really interesting. He's hot and he talks about sex...wonderful!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2006<br>Class Name: HST275<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought this class was interesting and easy. As long as you go to class and get his notes you'll know what he wants on the quizzes. No final! I would recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2006<br>Class Name: HST275<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His tests are hard to do well on due to the fact that you need to write exactly what he wants.  You can be right and still get the answers wrong</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2005<br>Class Name: AMERICATO1800<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the better profs @ DePaul... Very interesting class, no traditional text, several books and short readings. Classes consist mainly of lecture but some class discussions. Honestly, his lectures are very interesting. I looked forward to them. Quizzes on the semi-difficult side but take this professor!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2005<br>Class Name: HST280<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Short readings for every class.Lectures half the class then goes over readings. 4 quizes for (20% each), half short answer, half essay. Last assignment is revision of one previous essay (20%). 3 novels to read (not too bad to read). Take good notes. Showed 2 entire movies. Encourages class particpation but not necessary.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2005<br>Class Name: HST280<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor made history very interesting and even caused me to change my major to history.  If I had the chance to take him again I would.  He is very knowledgable on History to the 1800s and has very interesting facts that I didn't know about before. Also, he aint bad to look at. We had four test and a paper based on one of the essay topics.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2005<br>Class Name: HST280<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although he seemed nervous at the start of the quarter, he turned out be a great teacher.  Not outrageously difficult, good sense of humor, understanding, and friendly. If you pay attention in class you'll do fine.  Very little, short readings, which you go over in class.  Thomas Foster is a GREAT teacher, & I would take a class of his again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/13/2005<br>Class Name: HST280<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
