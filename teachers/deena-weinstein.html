The class was only an hour and a half but she was so mean to anyone who would answer questions that it would be dead silent for the whole period and it would feel like forever. ABSOLUTELY DO NOT TAKE THIS PROF. Had her for Soc of ROCK MUSIC, should be fun right? Wrong.

I don't ever understand a word she's saying and she makes you feel bad if you don't agree with her. I don't know how people have even passed this class in the past... just wish I had known to avoid before signing up. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2015<br>Class Name: SOC281<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rude, disrespectful and condescending to students, loves embarrassing anyone who is late, yawns or doesn't agree with what she has to say.  Will also deduct points for those reasons as well. Constantly patting herself on the back for writing the textbook used in class, which she expects you to know from front to back. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2015<br>Class Name: SOC281<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>If you like being awash in a bizarre world of craziness and fury, take this class. It doesn't follow linear time or common sense. She often backtracks or goes on weird spiels and will not hesitate to immediately invalidate anything you say. One email is 10% of your grade. It's almost masochistically hilarious, so I would go for that. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2015<br>Class Name: 280<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Okay, so I've taken two courses with Deena. I wish someone told me these things before I signed up: 1. GET ON HER GOOD SIDE. If she likes you, you get an A. 2. FOLLOW HER FORMATS. She has weird rules. Follow them anyway. 3. AGREE WITH HER. She knows what she wants to hear, say it. That's how you pass. 4. GO TO EVERY CLASS. You get extra credit.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2015<br>Class Name: SOC280<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a tough teacher, but in the end, I learned a lot. Was never happy to go to her class but I did do well on the final. You have to read A TON and the outlines get tedious. Make sure you do all the assignments and show up to every class (she counts against your grade if you don't show). Get on her good side and you'll probably be ok. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2014<br>Class Name: SOC280<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Seriously, do not take this class. I'm just tacking on the nail here, but one of the most stubborn professors at DePaul. Does not make any of her assignments clear. Attempts to make assigned readings relevant to the digital era but embarrassingly fails at it. If you want an A in the course, just kiss her ass and tell her she's interesting. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2013<br>Class Name: SOC387<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Weinstein is one of the most interesting people I have ever met. She is absolutely brilliant, but extremely intimidating. She grew on me through out the quarter as I got to know her and her teaching style. Her class is a challenge, but I learned a lot and it got me to think critically. Don't rule her out. I will remember this class forever.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2013<br>Class Name: SOC280<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably the worst teacher I have ever had at Depaul.  She never clarifies anything and never answers your question clearly; and if you do have a question she mocks, insults, and questions your reading ability.  She is way to focused on the structure of you completed assignment and seems like she can care less about the content. also very arrogant.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2013<br>Class Name: SOC280<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very smart, has a lot of substance, but very proud and antagonistic.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2013<br>Class Name: SOC<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Anyone who says they do not like Dr. Weinstein clearly does not a challenge. Although she is strict on certain things, she honestly knows so much about what she is talking about and is so passionate. She is very intellectual and I have learned so much from her class. If you actually want to learn take her class! The homework load is not that bad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2013<br>Class Name: SOC330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>dr. weinstein is the best prof that i have ever had in my life....yes she is strict but so is the real world....she cares and her intelligence is deep and profound....yet she a very big heart....i have seen gone to other school for a masters....and i can still say without a doubt she is the best teacher i have ever had in my university career..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2013<br>Class Name: SOC280<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The readings are interesting, but if you're someone who benefits from class discussion then this is not the class for you. She makes frequently reductive comments and does not facilitate a welcoming environment. She frequently informs students that they're "wrong" with no further explanation, and she deducts points for yawning.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2013<br>Class Name: ROCK101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Expectation are clear from the first day.

I took her class while working on my teaching certification. She was rude, had unreasonable demands, was demeaning to students and played favorites.

Anything said in a paper or in class needs to be exactly what you mean, as it seems she lacks the ability to infer any opinion that is not hers.
