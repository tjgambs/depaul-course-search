He taught us the stupidity of texts books, and the only reason he had us buy one was to make fun of it. For your first year, 1st Englisg course, he's the man. I'm a junior now, and I still use what he taught us.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2008<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors at DePaul.

I highly recommend him to anyone who wants something more than a typical english class.  The papers are definitely different, but honestly they are easy to write and fun too. You discover a lot about your writing and make it a lot better.  Also, you get to rewrite all of your major papers. Easy to get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT teacher! Really keeps people involved! First couple of classes were strictly on facebook! He cancels a lot of classes which is cool. He isn't always clear on assignments but pretty much grades pass or fail so its really simple! Quite a few 1 pg papers but there REALLY easy to write! Definetly take him if you have the chance!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2008<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best english classes that I have ever taken. He will teach you how to write papers that will help you after college. His views on english are amazing and if you are willing to work you will get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2008<br>Class Name: ENG300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, extremely helpful.

His course is definately different from an average Eng class, but seriously, he makes you think.  And the papers are a lot of fun, I actually looked forward to writing them.  He keeps you interested, and bonus, you get to rewrite everything.  If you are up to a not-so-average english class, I definately recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved his calss! he REALLY makes you examine your writting like you never have before. The papers are hard but really make you think and learn.

He def. showed whom he liked and whom he disliked. However, easy class overall. Lets you rewrite the papers. Boring frm time to time. Did not learn much, but def. learned new styles of writing(blah). Shows videos, talks about his wife. A pleasant man if you go to his class and participate.oh yes, PARTICIPATE!Good teacher, do take him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His teaching style is definitely different from other professors. I first thought he was nice and all, but taking Eng104 with other professor showed me that he doesn't teach what we need to know! All his speech about feminine discourse is useless in the following courses, and for what we are truly asked for in academic writing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is VERY attractive.

You can tell that he loves to teach. He wants you to get a good grade in his class. I usually hate participating so I never spoke up too much I still got away with a B-. If you hate english I recommend taking his class because it's not the same old boring english classes he wants to see you think. Easy papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's very easy going, always says &quot;write as if your life depends on it.&quot; I recommend taking him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very abstract style of teaching.

He changed my life and has me think very differently about the world (in general) and not just english. His abstract teaching methods are incredible and he is a great guy.

He is young, energetic and full of fun. His papers are pretty easy if you listen in class. You can only miss one day if you have a Tue, Thurs class.. Otherwise I recommend him,you will not miss out. He makes you think about things you probably wouldn't normally think about.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really cool guy.

He is prolly the best english teacher i've ever had. Any1 who doesn't like him is probably the biggest lame. There are no rules; its just rhetoric. NO commas, grammer, or any of that. 3 papers, which your peer reviewers grade first, then you fix it and turn it in. then at the end u get to deicde how much each paper is worth. TAKE HIM!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWSOME and damn interesting and easy!3 papers, he grades them hands them back and you get to correct em and hand em bak in for an offical grade.

I was expecting to see him again this year sometime so I could get my portfolio back.  NOPE.  He is not registered in the directory through our e-mail system.  I want my kitty cat folder back.

I have never been pushed to think as much as he made me.  Yes, he's vague, but that's the POINT!  You're actually supposed to put something into your own education, and if you are willing to put that forth, he'll teach you more than you believed was possible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/04/2005<br>Class Name: CORE<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>tests, etc = easy....Really funny guy....Raises a lot of questions that really make you think.
