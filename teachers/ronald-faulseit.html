Very nice, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic about archaeology, but not really available to talk to if you need help, but that's understandably so, he works at the Field Museum too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2013<br>Class Name: ANT120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was too early for me, at 8 am. But besides that, all is good. He has done some on-site work, so he really knows his stuff.

We did a lot of fun labs and he told you exactly what was going to be on the tests. There were some long boring power points, and a couple of essay assignments but that is to be expected, you are in college.</div></div></div></body></html>
