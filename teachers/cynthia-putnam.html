She really bends over backwards to help students succeed and understand the material. Additionally, she teaches a very meaningful lesson throughout the class. She brings in some great guest speakers. If you have the chance, take this class with her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2013<br>Class Name: HCI445<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cynthia engages the class very well in discussion and presents relevant examples of how research methods are applied in the real world. The main project is iterative that you add to over the quarter. Final is a take home final. Course moves at a faster pace with lots of reading and work. Expect to spend 10-16 hrs/week outside of class. Take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2013<br>Class Name: HCI514<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excessive amount of work in course my opinion. But Professor Putnam is very helpful and an excellent teacher. She is fair in grading. Easy to talk to, and replies to emails are polite and detailed. Final take home exam was straight forward. Major emphasis is on a paper written in stages throughout the term. Take HCI514 when Putnam is teaching it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/25/2011<br>Class Name: GAM226<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A great course and a great teacher. She has spent time in the field and has a lot of knowledge to impart. We played all sorts of games in class and learned what game design is at its core.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2011<br>Class Name: GAM226<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>We play tons of games, but since this is a game design class it fits. She teaches very well but makes the class fun at the same time.</div></div></div></body></html>
