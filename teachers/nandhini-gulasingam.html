Her materials and presentations helped us analyze and get to these conclusions independently. I love how she teaches the activities to the class, it also includes step by step guide on how to do the activities. Its great if you get a little lost or want to practice yourself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/06/2014<br>Class Name: GEO242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Nandhini is great! She uses interesting examples to illustrate topics. No matter what your learning style is, she can gauge if you understand a topic, and adjust content to ensure everyone understands the materials. She never leaves people behind. My skills as a GIS user have significantly improved as a result of taking this course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2014<br>Class Name: GEO342<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The Professor is extremely helpful and kind. I am not a fan of GIS so it pretty much dragged. The tests were a bit difficult but do all of the assignments and lab activities and you'll do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2012<br>Class Name: GEO241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nandhini is a breath of fresh air. GIS is such an intimidating field, but she makes it enjoyable and exciting thanks to her clarity and extensive background working with the program. Class could have been a bit more in depth and challenging, but you will definitely walk away knowing the basics of ArcGIS. She got me excited about the certification!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/04/2011<br>Class Name: GEO441<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is one of the best teachers I have ever had.
