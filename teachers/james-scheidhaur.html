He puts the various concepts into perspective (explains that we don't actually know what energy is, for example). He's easy (took him in the summer tho ?everything's easy then). He's a bit too congenial with his students: has us call him Jim and he calls us his friends. NBD tho.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2010<br>Class Name: PHYS3<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>coolest teacher ever. hilarious, really laid back, takes time explaining and wants his students to do well. always willing to help, by far one of the best professors at depaul!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2010<br>Class Name: PHY206<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is waaay too irritating.
