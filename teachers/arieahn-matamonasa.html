She is nearly impossible to get ahold of and takes weeks to respond via email if at all. She will go back and forth with you on your proposal until you run out of time or interest.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2013<br>Class Name: IN307<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Arieahn is so , so cool.  I had her for a Psychology class and she made it more interesting. She is very approachable, though her hotness can be distracting.  Not an easy grader, but very fair and I appreciate that in a Prof.   She is very hot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2013<br>Class Name: FOUNDATIONS<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would think twice before taking Arieahn for foundations.  She is very busy and seems too busy for her many students.  If you are someone who will need a lot of help throughout the rest of your career at DePaul, you might want to choose another foundations professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2012<br>Class Name: LL250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Matamonasa is a great professor. She presents the material in a well-organized and clear manner. Her lectures are interesting and lively. She is fully invested in her classes and students' success. She is a great mentor too. I'd take any class with her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2012<br>Class Name: RSCHSNAPE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is everything academia and a professor should be.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2009<br>Class Name: SNL755<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is not an easy class but it is a challenging one that is worth taking. It is a course that you will value in our progressive society. Getting an A is very obtainable but yes, you have to work for it. You won't be disappointed. Expert in the subject matter and has a lot to offer. If you don't like to earn you grade, pick another class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2008<br>Class Name: RSRCHSEM<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Arieahn's a wonderful teacher. Her classes were lively, she challenged us, and she brought the real world into many of her lessons and plans. Would definitely take more classes from her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2007<br>Class Name: TERRSNL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Arieahn was strict yet likable. Afterall, we are at DePaul to learn. She was sympahtetic and very knowledgable. I learned more than course content from her and would take any class from her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2006<br>Class Name: RSRCHSEM<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Arieahn is an outstanding teacher.  She understands adult learners and is personally invested in the success of each of her students.  She breaks down the immense amount of work in her research seminar course into workable pieces that can be put together to create a proposal.  I would take her for every class if I could.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2006<br>Class Name: FOUNDLRNG<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Arieahn is a chatterbox that comes to class unprepared and wings it...&quot;we heard that lecture last week&quot;. She is way too busy to be of much help and somewhat on the defensive (gets mad at students). Your questions will go unanswered however, she is generally likeable.</div></div></div></body></html>
