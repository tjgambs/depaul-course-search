I don't know why people are saying he's old-fashioned (whatever that means); he's rather open-minded.  Sometimes it's hard to understand his point, but if you ask, he'll explain.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2005<br>Class Name: ARB<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You wont learn arabic, you will get an A, but you wont learn arabic.
