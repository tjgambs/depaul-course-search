It's one of those classes that really changes the way you think. His journal assignments are a little vague and the class is a lot of work, but it's worth it. Jason is very interested in his subject and genuinely enjoys teaching, especially if you need outside help. Highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2006<br>Class Name: COMPAPP2<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this prof gets a bad rap. for good reasons tho. his lectures are long, scatterbrained and can be boring, crits go for the full 3 hrs, gives class work, never lets out early. BUT he does know a lot and genuinely tries to help and communicate his ideas. craft is very important to him. take hime if you want to get a teacher thats best when one on one</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2006<br>Class Name: APPSFORDES1<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>To the person who said that he stresses print quality: DUH. It's a Applications for Design class. One of the objectives of the class is to learn how to use the printers correctly. Jason's good: my one complaint is that the demos he provides can feel a bit out of place, as they may or may not relate to the project at hand.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2006<br>Class Name: COMPAPPS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved him!!

He tells you what he likes and what you should do and then you do it, and he rips apart your project in the crit.  His crits suck, not good at all!  Avoid him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2005<br>Class Name: ART227<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jason Greenberg is the best design professor at DePaul!  He is so helpful and I would definitely recommend taking any of his classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2005<br>Class Name: COMPAPPDESI<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>not very impressed with his teaching style. individual comments were positive during work time, he's says everything is okay, and then rips you on crit day and lowers grade. puts more emphasis on print quality than actual work. not very receptive to printing problems. seems to be biased - prefers work in IL over PS.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2005<br>Class Name: COMPAPSDESIGN<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was the worst teacher I have ever had in DePaul. Avoid him at all costs. Very unclear, cannot teach, gives horrible assignmenst too much tedious work, anal, and grades unfairly. Horrible teacher, if you have to take him you are warned.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2005<br>Class Name: COMAPSDESIGNI<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was the worst teacher I have ever had. I learned nothing in this calls. He only wants you to do what he likes. DO NOT TAKE HIM!!! He is horrible. He should not be a teacher. I know many would agree with me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2005<br>Class Name: ARTANDDESIGN<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He could be really good, because he seems to know alot. Doesnt teach at all. Very unclear on assignments, redid every project to only get 1/2 grade higher. Also grades according to if he likes the design , even though its NOT HIS WORK. DONT TAKE HIM, unless you wanna do alot for NOTHING!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2005<br>Class Name: ART260<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a bad grader. He marks you down if you don't go to Kinko's to print. I spent way too much money for his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2005<br>Class Name: ART260<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow...what an awful professor. If you have a lot of money to spend on your projects and are willing to re do them over again for a 1/2 letter grade better take him. otherwise STAY AWAY! He is knowledgeable, but cant convey the information.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2005<br>Class Name: ART227<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is not a good professor. He has a lot of experience and knowledge but did not pass any of that on to his students. He also is a very unfair grader and give a lot of work to do.</div></div></div></body></html>
