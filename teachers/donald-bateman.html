If you want to know more about finance world and learn - that's the guy! Interesting lectures, bit dry-but its finance! I am taking him for 2 classes now, and I do not regret! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2014<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't buy the textbook. Don't need it. There are hw problems from it, but you can just google those. There is a midterm and a final. As long as you read and reread the powerpoints to the point of memorization, and as long as you actually answer the sample essay questions he gives you, you will be fine. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2014<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AVOID!!!! The book is over 100 dollars and is only used for 2 assignments that count toward participation which is 10% of your grade which you don't learn about till it's too late to return. The other 2 assignments are a 5 page research papers that he isn't clear on what to cover specifically about the subjects.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2013<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Bateman is one of the brightest professors out there. He has a huge experience in the Finance world and is willing to share his knowledge. This was one of my favorite classes. I really recommend this class, it will teach you a lot. Practice multiple choice questions he gives out right away on d2l and get ready to answer essay questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2013<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Man was this class BORING. He was a nice guy but was so boring even though I thought the material was interesting. He consistently says "I am from industry." The tests were not too tough. I recommend going over the multiple choice questions he gives you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2012<br>Class Name: FIN398<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Expected a lot of our case study assignments and didn't give clear guidelines to what he wanted. Midterm and Final are open book/open laptop though...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2012<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Donald is an awesome guy. Attendance is mandatory. He is very nice and understanding. Definitely knows his stuff and is willing to help. He goes off powerpoint so class can be dry at times. I learned a lot and I would take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2012<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Bateman is an extremely knowledgeable professor. He's overwhelmingly helpful, he's very nice, very patient, and even has a great sense of humor. He's not a tough grader, tests are very straight forward. My class wasn't all that talkative - so I felt we didn't receive all he had to offer, but I would definitely retake Mr. Bateman if I had to.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2012<br>Class Name: FIN398<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor.

Very smart, very informed on the subject matter, even though it's not the most exciting. Read the chapters, articles, and study the powerpoints. Don't hesitate to ask him any questions or to look over a paper before turning it in; extremely helpful!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2011<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's awesome...Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2010<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very nice professor, fair grader and a kind person overall. But! Extremely boring lectures. People are talking during his class and he says nothing to them. Looks like he is afraid of his students. Sometimes looks confused about material.Even though I tried to listen to his lectures, it was hard :) Midterm and final are straightforward.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2010<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fantastic professor. Gives real world examples that give the lecture some meaning (something professors suck at). Wealth of experience. Willing to help. Sometimes goes off on tangents, but it is mostly related to finance anyways. Overall outstanding professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2010<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love that he has real world experience because any time he gets stuck with his slides he just talks about experience. Class was so straight forward no surprises really fair grader. Class can be rough but if you go there will be no surprises on any exam. 2 mini papers, two exams, and attendance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2010<br>Class Name: FIN398<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Would not reccommend... take Karen instead.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2010<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>fun class, hard class.don't expect anything higher than a B with hard work put in.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2010<br>Class Name: FIN398<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor!!!This is a financial planning class and we actually did a real-life project! very interesting, helpful and interactive class!
