He was teaching the class I took for the first time and was pretty disorganized, but in the end it was pretty successful. I do think he speaks too much English for an upper level Spanish course. Love him as a person, so-so as a teacher, but I would definitely give him another shot :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2009<br>Class Name: SPN126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The absolute best professor I have had at DePaul!!!!!

I think his accent is Chilean. Teaches so you understand the basics. Test after every chapter, comps, and orals. some HW too. Class is fun because he is interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2008<br>Class Name: SPN124<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher. I've always wondered why my Spanish teachers didn't explain difficult concepts to the rest of the class in the most simple, comprehensible, and useful way possible. He does this. Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2008<br>Class Name: SPN124<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really good professor.  He really wants his students to do well and he was always willing to help and made himself really available.  He made test review sheets even though he wasn't supposed to.  He has an accent, but it's not bad at all he's lived here for like 25 years or something.  4 quizzes, 2 compositions, 1 oral 'exam'. Take him if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2008<br>Class Name: SPN105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bernardo is not a good teacher. He speaks in english the majority of the time and there isn't much class participation. I think my spanish got worse with him as my teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2008<br>Class Name: SPN105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is really incredible. He grew up in Chile under Pinochet, if that means anything to you, and he's always got something interesting to say each class. He's not a very tough grader, and there isn't a single D or F that you can't talk your way up to a C. He's nice, and pretty funny. Take him if you have the opportunity.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2008<br>Class Name: SPN220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Profe Navia is probably my favorite teacher that I have ever had at DePaul.  He is very insightful and really piques your interest in the subject. He will make a point to talk to every student personally to find out their opinions and progress on the course. If anything, take him cause he's definitely easy on the eyes :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2007<br>Class Name: SPN104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Can't go wrong with Bernardo.  He's nice, he's helpful, he's funny, he'll cut you serious grading slack just because he likes you.  As if that weren't enough, he's a good, engaging teacher and he knows his****.  Definitely take him for ALL 100-level Spanish if you possibly can - you'll learn what you need to and have fun doing it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2007<br>Class Name: SPN207<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bernardo is a wonderful teacher and a great guy. He is genuinely interested in what his students have to say and treats them like adults. The most difficult part of his class is that he doesn't spoon feed you the information. You practice the material in class, but usually I had to learn it outside of class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2007<br>Class Name: SPN202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bernardo takes the spanish language and transforms speaking into an art form.

He is not, however, the best at teaching grammar. I recommend taking the class for the experience and having a tutor or taking the time to read the book to help you with grammar if you're not already good at it. If If you don't understand, ask. He happily answers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2006<br>Class Name: SPN104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>amazing~ there is no way you can not like him, and in most girls cases fall in luv with him after the first day of classes~ I think the best thing about him is that he is completely honest with us about anything and everything-definitely take him if u can</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2006<br>Class Name: SPN105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is the best teacher I ever had at depaul.

He makes a boring Spanish class bearable, with his hilarious stories. You will learn, despite the fact that the workload is easy.
