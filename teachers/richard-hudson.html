Straightforward about what is on our quizzes and tests-right from the lectures or the reading notes he gives you. His voice drives me up a wall though, I can hardly focus during lecture, and he gives way too many "asides", or things we don't need to know for the quizzes or tests. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/13/2013<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Being a good writer did not really help in this case (it really wouldn't).  This professor simply wants to give students bad grades rather than help us to do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/13/2013<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was probably rather interested in hunting for faults in our work rather than wanting us to do the assignments at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/28/2013<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The reason why clarity is poor is because he did not do a good job of explaining instructions especially for many assignments. He also does not give proper comments until after grading.  Don't take a class with him.  He may have been good before, but that is not the case at all today.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2013<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He graded the homework too hard. He also did not do a good job of making comments on rough drafts. Moreover, his requirements were more of a capstone requirement than a focal point.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/13/2013<br>Class Name: BIO126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hudson has a great sens of humor and comedic timing which plays into the understanding of the material.  He tests predominately off his lectures, which are quite thorough.  I would take his class again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2012<br>Class Name: BIO126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Hudson is great! I loved the 3 hour long class, he made it really enjoyable.  His assignments were easy and he's really nice and funny.  Pay attention to the lecture because the book is not used at all.  He's easy and a really good teacher. I would deff take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2012<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this class is definitely not the easiest, but i LOVED dr. hudson. he's by no means a perfect teacher but he's very receptive to student feedback. he's so nice and really, really wants to help his students. he actually made a 3 hour lab enoyjoyable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2011<br>Class Name: BIO162<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His class seemed pretty straightforward and easy to follow seeing as I hadn't taken a science class for a few years. His tests and quizzes were nothing unexpected and mostly from lecture.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2010<br>Class Name: BIO115<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just avoid him. At one point i noticed how he started giving me bad grades, and yet my answers on the quizes were right! hmm..Im pretty damn sure i answered the questions on the final correctly and yet, i some how failed. Interesting. He based on the final on quiz questions. I studied all and..failed. Avoid him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2009<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very nice guy, but his hw assignments are too boring...his labs directions are not clear in any way...his quiz review are not on the quizzes...depaul sucks the big one for having this class as a requirement. go bears.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2009<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A really nice guy and a good teacher. Lab class + Summer school + Hudson = Perfect combination. Maybe too many little assignments, but to be honest they were all really easy! Highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2009<br>Class Name: LSP101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He gives too many tedious assignments.  Extremely boring homework.  Nonetheless, the assignmets and quizzes are very easy.  Not as difficult as other classes, but the homework is all busy work. You should get an A if all asignments are completed. You decide.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2009<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I actually loved Hudson. He grades fairly and lets you know what's wrong and what's right. He's very helpful and always available. He can be a bit boring and nerdy, but overall I did learn things. He's lenient and spacey. If you do all the work, you're pretty much guaranteed an A. The work isn't rocket science either.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2008<br>Class Name: BIO115<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, interesting class. I can't believe people are complaining about him... compared to other profs Ive had at this school, he does a good job teaching and he's a nice guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2008<br>Class Name: BIO224<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The teacher means well for his students, but he is incapable of teaching efficiently. If you want an easy A, take this class. However, if you actually want to learn something, don't take it. Plus (except if you want to keep it like me), the book is almost USELESS (only use it for the figures). Teacher usually cannot answer questions well. Still OK.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although very disorganized, Hudson is a great guy who means well. I thought the class was very easy, but you must keep up with the readings if you want to do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2008<br>Class Name: BIO224<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So Hudson basically teaches this class terribly. Try asking him a question, common response is &quot;I don't know, but I can find out.&quot; Teachers need to know the subject to teach it and he doesn't know jack about physiology. Plus the powerpoint lectures are random facts that don't get the point across. Mostly quizes combined MC and SA questions...miswor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/12/2008<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not just saying this, but he really was the worst teacher i have had at DePaul. he shouldnt even be a teacher, stupid busy work for assignments, completely scatter- brained, and BOOORING.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2008<br>Class Name: BIO115<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>terrible class.  it's all busy work, he should not be a teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2007<br>Class Name: BIO115<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sometimes a little unclear, but definitely is conscious of that. If you are not a biology or science major, this class is for you. Some of the homework assignments seem like English assignments, which can just be tedious in a 'science' class. However, overall not bad at all. Take Hudson!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2007<br>Class Name: BIO115<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great teacher. He is very flexible about alot of stuff, except attendance. Attendance isn't mandatory, but if you do come, being late is frowned upon. Overall, he is a good teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2006<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Hudson was not the most organized all of the time, but most us weren't either!  He is passionate about what he teaches and will help you at any time!  As long as you pay attention and do most of the reading, this class is not hard! I learned some basic things in the class, as well as interesting facts I would have otherwise not known!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2006<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Hudson is a great teacher.  If you don't understand something, he more than willingly meets with you whenever and clarifies your issues.  If you actually put effort into his class, DO THE READINGS and study for the quizes, you will EARN a good grade.  He is an easy teacher if you try in his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2006<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a very nice man..reminds me of Mr. Rogers &quot;wont you be my neighbor&quot;.  But he is disorganized and unclear in his lectures. He doesn't not have a set plan or agenda. But his homework is easy. If your nice to him, he'll go easy on the grading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2006<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very nice man but should definitely NOT be a professor.  He is unclear about what he wants from you regarding in class assignments and manages to confuse himself more often than not. You also tend to spend alot of time doing worthless activites. He is also an unfair grader.</div></div></div></body></html>
