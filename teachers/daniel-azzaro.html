I really hear nothing but good things about this guy. Took him last semester and I had mixed feelings. The guy seems super nice and cool, but I wish class was a little more serious. Never thought I'd say that. But I just couldn't handle the constant joking with past students. Frustrating at times, but overall, class was ok.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awful. He might be better in his element (prad classes) but this course that he came up with was such a stitched-together weak excuse for a course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD392<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors I've ever had. Hands down. Every lecture was interesting and engaging. He is incredibly funny and genuinely cares about his students. A real college professor. Doesn't care about attendance, but rather that you grasp the material. He gives minimal work and understands that students have lives! TAKE HIS CLASS!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredible professor and has 30+ years of experience in the advertising and marketing business so he is very knowledgable. I highly recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Simply amazing!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2011<br>Class Name: PRAD392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've never had a class with him; I graduated a year ago from DePaul and live with two girls who still attend there. With that said, ALL I HEAR ABOUT IS DAN AZZARO so he must be doing something right.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2011<br>Class Name: CMN291<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher he is very clear and really tries to get the class involved.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2010<br>Class Name: CMNS291<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Azzaro is cool with me. He's really corny and his handwriting is illegible. But he's super smart and knows everything about the advertising world. He's an average grader.</div></div></div></body></html>
