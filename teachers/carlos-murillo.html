During last year's new play workshop at the athanaeum he routinely dissed the play to the actors and design team.  The man completely lacks even the most basic ability to interact without being awkward and he lacks any modicum of professionalism.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2005<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was okay in the end. Grades harshly and critiques are scary.
