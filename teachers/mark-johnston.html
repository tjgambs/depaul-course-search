He is a good person, I just feel I did not learn much from this class as a result of his teaching and it is unfortunate.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2011<br>Class Name: SPN301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The guy is lazy and clearly does not care about teaching.  He makes it very difficult to learn anything in his class and designs assignments that have very little relevance to course material and function more like mindless busy-work.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS CLASS.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2011<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mark is the best. The class is fun and he gives in class work but it is easy. The midterm is a little tough but he lets you use notes on one of the sections. Overall great class no problem to get a A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2010<br>Class Name: SPN104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the best spanish professor. He was extremely helpful and really made the class interesting. You couldn't regret taking his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher at DePaul!!!  Loves what he does and it shows.  Makes the class so interesting and the presentations were fun to do...and yes he is easy to look at for an hour and a half.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2010<br>Class Name: SPN104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good, fun professor with a clear understanding of Spanish, and on top of that is very casual and personal in class. My only issue was that I thought he relied much too heavily on in-class speaking group activities we students did amongst ourselves, which doesn't really help me learn Spanish at all, and that was a bit disappointing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2009<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His sophomore seminar is awesome!  He keeps it very interesting and explains things very clearly.  He loves what he does and therefore teaches it well.  2 presentations which were actually fun to do.  Very easy class and a joy to attend Take him! Oh and he's for sure good looking.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2007<br>Class Name: SPAN202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First of all he speaks great spanish! I agree he's one of the best professors I've had. Has a funny sense of humor and easy to talk to. The class was fairly easy, alot of homework but again it was easy. It would be in your best interest to attend his class, you'll learn alot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2007<br>Class Name: SPN202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hands down the best professor at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2006<br>Class Name: SPN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As a dude, I won't comment on the whole George Clooney thing, but I would say he is an excellent professor. It's no wonder he's the head of the modern language department. He is absolutely one of DePaul's greatest assets.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2005<br>Class Name: SPANISH220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT PROF. Good teaching style. Laid back. Funny. You learn a lot. Grades very fairly. Always willing to help. Wonderful Man. TAKE HIS CLASS!!! Also, I wouldn't say HOT, but he does sort of have a distinguished, George Clooneyish look.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2005<br>Class Name: SPN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2005<br>Class Name: SPN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a wonderful professor.  I wish I could take him next quarter but he is not teaching the course I need.  He is the chair of the Spanish department.  He is very funny and makes class very fun.  He is not boring.  Also, just for fun he does have that whole older attractive man thing going on.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: SPN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher!!!
