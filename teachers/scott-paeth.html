We had 4 papers, pretty clear expectations and he was always willing to meet outside of class to help clarify anything. Good at connecting reading to discussions. Participation in discussions is a must and you have to do at least some of the reading so you can contribute. An understanding and helpful guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2015<br>Class Name: REL251<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Paeth is a very intelligent guy, and makes many references throughout his lectures to help understand the material.

This class is exactly what we should be going to college for -- regardless of the workload, he genuinely cares about the material and does his best to help you through it. Deeply intelligent (it's hard not to have an intellectual crush on him), kind, and funny.

Be sure to stay on top of everything, attend class, and take lots of notes! I was dreading taking a religion class, the class discussions were awesome, and he's also funny, nice, and more than willing to help if you're lost.

With that said, do not take his summer class if you are looking for a blow-off. Took it just to get the credit in and worked pretty hard for the grade.

Prof. Paeth is very nice and interested in the subject matter. There is alot of reading, but most of the material is thought provoking. There are 2 short papers and 1 long one and thats it really, besides reading and attendence.

While there is a lot of reading for this class, it is not always required to participate in class. We did not always stay on topic but none-the-less learned a ton. No test. 2 short papers and 1 long. He gave several extra credit chances.

A.) Doesn't talk about the reading in class B.) Expects you to read 7 books over 9 weeks C.) Requires attendance.

There are 3 papers: 2 small, 1 research (final), and weekly online postings. He's really interesting/smart, and as long as you ask the right questions he?ll stay on topic of the books.

I think this man is the king of books, if you visit his office they are literally every where. Needless to say, you'll do a good amount of reading.

He's very well read and that makes discussions interesting. Participation is important and it doesn't have to relate to the readings so speak up. Ask for help on papers if you're confused. Proofread your work and you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2009<br>Class Name: REL262<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Paeth expects way too much reading.  There is little reason to read the books as the discussions rarely if ever have anything to do with the readings.  The class seems interesting.

He does make you read a lot and depending on you class the discussions may go off topic, but having the discussions go off topic is the best part of the class. The readings are relevant to the course and he chooses them for a reason so do the readings.
