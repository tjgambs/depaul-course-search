No study guide for tests that covered EVERYTHING. Often doesn't explain things very well, just kind of assumes that the students have a lot of knowledge about chemistry, so no real explanation of anything. Class, subject, and teacher are disorganized. Not my favorite class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2011<br>Class Name: CHE103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Whipple is a nice guy and is knowledgeable and passionate about this subject. However, his expectations of nonmajors are just way too high. You are not going to read 30 pages of fine print chemistry AND answer extra problems AND take online quizzes AND be ready to take a quiz on that every week when you have work to do for your major.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2011<br>Class Name: CHE103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take this class unless you are a chemistry major</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2011<br>Class Name: CHE103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The previous class section is wrong. It's not CHE201.

He seems nice, but unhelpful at all. NEVER respond email! He expects you to understand everything by you own from the textbook. His lecture is extremely unorganized. You have no idea what he's talking if you are a non-science major student. NEVER take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2011<br>Class Name: CHEM103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As an adjunct faculty, he is not accessible after class. He is passionate about the subject that he expects so much interests and dedication from evryone in the class. however, most of the people take the class are not science major,which makes no sense for him to create so much work to do and expect students to know everything from the book. BAD!!</div></div></div></body></html>
