With each day we would have to write a scientific review and also more assigned papers throughout the quarter. Lots of fun, but lots of writing as well</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2009<br>Class Name: ENG309<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard, but good for your growth overall.

I loved our class workshops and he always made sure to point out both the things that needed improvement and the things that were well done. He was firm about doing the readings and class participation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/31/2008<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the biggest hacks at DePaul he blatantly plays favorites. He is very passive-agressive and has no strength of character, an effeminate bourgesois characteristic of the Illinois northsore, he does not teach but rather perpetuates his own narcissism. A true coward he will hold it against you if you write something he doesn't agree with.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: ENG291<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If only I had a time machine.  Anton is terrible.  He seems friendly and approachable, but he is way too demanding and overly sensitive.  If you miss class, don't do the reading, or don't have an assignment one day, be prepared for a tantrum.  The class is very high school, except Anton isn't clear about assignments or his expectations.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2007<br>Class Name: ENG490<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easily the worst professor I've had in my combined six years of undergraduate and graduate studies. His instruction is minimal, favoritism runs high, and he's rarely available when he says he will be. Save yourself $1,500 and open an account on Mediabistro.  They'll give you all the same info on how to pitch to magazines with none of the headache.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2006<br>Class Name: ENG309<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was less than impressed with Anton on virtually every level. During ENG 309 this fall, He was sort of two-faced -- a nice &quot;laid back&quot; guy in the class room but aloof and unhelpful one on one (he'll tell you to write about &quot;interesting places, things, etc. you and your friends do&quot;). There's also no doubting he plays favorites with his students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2006<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ted rocked. He is totally chill and laid back. He makes me laugh. He gives very open assigments. I took him for creative writing, and didnt miss a class. I loved it.

A little spacey, but good feedback in class. He doesn't grade anything, though, so you just end up w/ a grade at the end of the course. It's kind of arbitrary.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/04/2005<br>Class Name: ENGLISH<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was one of the coolest professors I ever had!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/03/2005<br>Class Name: NONFICTION<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ted is amazing and I was lucky to have him as a writing prof.

I would take him again. My only problem was that he was a little disorganized at times and I only learned my grade the last week of class. He's a writer just like us who seeks publication.

I didnt get the hearts& circles. He claimed some true stories werent true enough for him or stories at all. He didnt make a lot of sense and would laugh while we tried to take the midterm and finals.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2005<br>Class Name: TRUESTORIES<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Professor Anton! He's so random and bizarre--But he's brilliant.  The class set up can be intimidating at first because everyone in class is reading and critiquing your papers, but its so helpful.
