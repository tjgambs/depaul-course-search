Usually looks high while teaching, also because of his baseless comments every other minute. Does not know his stuff, sometimes wastes hours on a single averagely relevant topic. Never take his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2014<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy A, but an extremely boring class. the midterm literally took me 10 minutes to complete because it was that easy. If you can take sitting in class for 3 hours at night take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2013<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Impossible to not get an A. Although the class was boring at times (a lot of that was due to the fact that it is a 3 hour night class), Mr. Staron really knows his material and has a vast musical background.  I liked him a lot. I would recommend the class if you need an arts liberal studies class that you would like an A in... or if you like music</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2013<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class, everything is pretty much handed to you. However, he is an absolutely awful teacher. He knows his stuff, but does not know how to actually teach or engage a class. Also makes snide comments sometimes that are quite unprofessional.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2013<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly the worst teacher I've ever had. He knows about classic music but his "lectures" are commentaries of songs. The quizzes, midterm, and final are straight from the book and are the only components of this class that are relative to the topic. Easy A if you have a wide attention span; goodluck not sleeping.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2012<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's an easy A, if you attend class (attendance is 15%). For me, I had a hard time going to class. He is so boring, it is difficult to stay awake the 3 hours. He repeats a lot and the music we learn is not exactly stimulating. Tests are easy. He gives listening quizzes which can be difficult if you aren't motivated to listen to this stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2010<br>Class Name: MUSIC100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take him! He is a really nice guy and you can tell he loves music. He knows the class is not for music majors so you do not need any prior music experience at all. Class can be boring but the class is fairly easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great and Extremely Easy Professor! Gives you the questions to the listening quizzes and Midterm and Final aren't hard at all.  Can get boring at times.  If you have an interest in music, this class will definetly be helpful and interesting.  Love this guy and it's an easy A!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2006<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is pretty easy overall! 5 listening quizes it is not that hard just listen to the music! and he tells u the exact questions on the midterm and the final!
