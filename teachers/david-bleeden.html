But he got repetitive so lectures got boring.  Helps with papers if you need it, which is great.  You can tell he loves Philosophy, but sometimes he seemed to want to be an English prof because he wanted us to become better writers not learn the material. Not bad overall, but not my favorite.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2013<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Oh my God I love Prof Bleeden. He is so down to earth, so crystal clear on his lectures and assignments and so helpful both in and out of the classroom. He offers additional help with papers. He is patient and approachable. Lots of writing but his lectures are so thorough that you will know the material so well by the time you write your papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2013<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>David is simply brilliant. I learned so much from him. He is truly interested in helping you out and makes sure you come out of his class learning lots. He offers to help outside of class whenever you need it. He makes himself very approachable too. I learned so much from his insights. Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2013<br>Class Name: PHIL101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved loved loved David. He is the perfect role model for high school and college kids. He's everything you'd ever want to be as an adult. He's cool, edgy and very well rounded. I didn't know what to expect about philosophy and I wound up loving it as a result of his teachings. He's hilarious too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2013<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>David is coolness personified. He's edgy, sporty, brilliant, articulate and an engaging professor. He elaborates his topics clearly. He does not attempt to complicate the understanding of philosophy quite the contrary. He takes the time to explain and to make sure you get it. Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2013<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was interesting,I expected to dread it but I really learned a lot. He pushes you to think for yourself. He is very smart and will go over something again in a different manner if you didn't understand it. He grades you on two papers:midterm and final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2012<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He may be one of the most talented teachers at DPU he is extremely intelligent which means he explains things perfectly to a degree that you will be able to understand and keep up HIS GOAL IS TO PUSH YOU TO THINK FOR YOURSELF and it works show up to class listen to his comical yet interesting lectures and write the 2 papers he assigns...A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2011<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's consistent and understands topics. Grades are based off of two papers, second builds off of the first. Allows the first midterm to be corrected in final, which can lead to another grade higher, for the midterm grade. He keeps the class moving, and tries to keep his personal opinions to himself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2011<br>Class Name: PHL101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Bleeden is very intersting and smart guy. He made the class really interesting. You really shouldn't miss class because you'll be lost next time you come.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2011<br>Class Name: PHL232<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The only con is that he travels a lot to random places like Greenland and Jamaica and what not and therefore he will take forever to return papers and essays. Don't get behind on the reading or you'll kick yourself come finals/midterms. Overall helpful an kind.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2011<br>Class Name: PHI201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great teacher, is very helpful but really challenging at the same time. He teaches the class on a much higher level than what it really is. The only problem is understanding the material, it takes a while to read and understand the material which will be most important on the final paper. If you want to really challenge yourself and how you think the take this class, if you don't then stay away.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2011<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher with a great sense of humor.  Does go threw text with you line by line but you really do have to ask questions and take notes and the papers will practically be done.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2011<br>Class Name: PHL232<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took him for PHL 232.  He's a GREAT teacher!  He just wants you to comprehend the material.  Read and take excessive notes during lectures and your papers will be a breeze! He goes over all of the material you read typically sentence by sentence to help you understand the language. If I hadn't already fulfilled my PHL classes I would take him again</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2010<br>Class Name: PHL232<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.  He really wants you to learn the stuff and the lectures are a basic outline of your papers.  You read and then he explains everything you read in class. Also a fair grader and very understanding.   Often gave extensions. Take Him!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2010<br>Class Name: PHL234<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>David, is actually a very awesome phl teacher, the material is difficult but he understands it is , and as long as one gets the material done somewhat right , hes happy. He is very understanding , and though he does say the words ok&#63; and right alot , he gets to the point.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2010<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely fantastic professor. I have taken him for 2 classes so far and truly recommend him. He provides very insightful and helpful feedback to students and is humorous and passionate about his subject.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher, great guy, super intelligent. He is great at getting back to people from emails and he helps so much when writing papers. PHL 100 wasn't too interesting as a Sophomore in a class full of freshman but then again that material is dense and boring. He worked with what he had, made understanding it much easier with great charts</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>pretty easy, no tests or quizzes which is even better. just follow the readings and have an opinion</div></div></div></body></html>
