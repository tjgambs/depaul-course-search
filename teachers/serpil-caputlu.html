As long as you do the hw and follow the steps shown in mymathlabs you'll be fine. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2015<br>Class Name: 135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div> She is very organized and includes the course calender in her syllabi with the dates of the quizzestests.  She does some daily quizzes as group work, and do review before the tests. She answers the students questions. She give office hours and stay longer if students needed. She does power point presentation and solve extra problems on the board.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/08/2015<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>All of the homework is done online through mymathlab, which includes detailed instructions and examples, and allows you unlimited tries to get a 100, which is nice. However, expect to teach yourself all of the material in this manner. This instructor only spends about 15 minutes giving muddled lectures. The rest is dedicated to confusing quizzes. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/14/2014<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Couldn't understand anything she said. Easy class because she uses mymathlabs and that is how I learned everything. All class I would sit on my computer and do nothing. Did not need to listen in class to understand material. Go to class, do homework and you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice lady, she just wanted everyone to get a good grade.Going to her class is mandatory but it was pointless.I just sat on my iphone the whole time and got an A because she makes it that easy. Quizzes are like 30% of the grade and theyre open-notes and w/ a partner. Uses MML which is great. Just do your homework and study for the final and get an A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2013<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall, I regret taking this class.  She cannot teach but has us use mymathlab which is useful.  She occasionally confuses herself and does not respond to emails.  Unless you have no other options I would go with another teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2013<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a very nice lady. Her power points are almost completely pointless, but just do the homework and you're fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2013<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Homework doesn't take long to do, mini quizes before each class that are straight from the homework.
