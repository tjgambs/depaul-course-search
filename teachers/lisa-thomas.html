I absolutely loved her and would take her over and over again. She treats students like adults and although cares about your grade, it's up to you. I would always recommend her!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2013<br>Class Name: HSP101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Lisa is really nice and fun as a professor, but she relies on students to read the book and just discusses the main points in lecture. She doesn't actually teach anything and rambles a lot. The midterm is open book and notes and the final is a paper. It's an easy class, but you won't learn anything.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2013<br>Class Name: HSP100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr.Lisa is the best teacher I've had at DePaul thus far. She is knowledgable, extremely helpful, and genuinely a great individual! She is very clear on what she expects from students and is more than willing to help anyone with questions regarding class, job, internship, even study abroad. I HIGHLY recommend taking her courses! Dr.Lisa is the best!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2013<br>Class Name: HSP100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I definitely recommend this professor. Midterm and final are both take-home exams.  One five-minute presentation. Very interesting and helpful introduction to the industry--don't think twice, just take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2013<br>Class Name: HSP100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher! She is very interested in the subject and will do anything to help. Attendance isn't mandatory but she likes you better if you attend most classes. Very easy assignments and you only use the book for the take home midterm and final. I would definitely take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2013<br>Class Name: HSP101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take home midterm and final, one 5 minute presentation, one paper. Seriously, take this professor if you have the opportunity. She is nice and it is so easy to get an A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2012<br>Class Name: HSP349<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Thomas is one of the greater professors at DePaul.

Don't really need to buy the textbook. Take home exams for final and midterm plus one project. Hello easy A! My favorite class at DePaul</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2012<br>Class Name: HSP339<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Knowledgeable,helpful, upbeat,friendly professor whom takes great interest and pride in everything she does. Didn't follow a textbook for this class, but she didn't need to due to the nature of the course. Worked hard to research everything about nonprofit foodservice management to relay the information to us. Very unique, fun classroom experience!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2012<br>Class Name: HSP100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Lisa is very straightforward about how she wants things done. She is strict with assignments being turned in on time but she simply wants us to learn to be on time for the real world. She is awesome.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2012<br>Class Name: HSP100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Lisa is super cool and nice.  She is very knowledgable about the industry and is very passionate about it but the class wasn't challenging at all- good or bad depending on what you want out of this class.  It's really easy and there aren't any tests.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2012<br>Class Name: HSP100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Lisa is fun, loving, and knows the industry. She loved working and now loves teaching. Her personality definitely fits hospitality and that also makes her a great teacher! She doesn't like assigning typical homework. She assigns homework that is useful in the actual hospitality industry such as presentations and papers (that are like proposals)</div></div></div></body></html>
