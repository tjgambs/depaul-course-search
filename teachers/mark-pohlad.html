Most class sessions is just come in, take notes from his lectures, do some reading for the next class session. The exams are pretty straight forward, just memorize the art piece and it's time period.

You'll love his classes!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2010<br>Class Name: HAA265<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Pohlad has a wonderful sense of humor and his passion for photography is beyond expectations.  His lectures are very clear and is willing to help with any questions you may have via email or even phone.  However, at times Mr. Pohlad makes arrogant and close-minded comments directed to various aspects of the class. Overall a great teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/27/2010<br>Class Name: ARTHIST<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Pohlad is nice, engaging and very intelligent.

Great personality. He personally relates to each and one of his students and really tries his best. He teaches well & is extremely knowledgeable. But don't be disrespectful or anything. Even if he is nice to you, you can tell he kind of has favorites. But unless you are extremely rude, (it's hard to be with Mark!) it should be OK</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2009<br>Class Name: HAA260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prob. the best prof. I've had at DePaul. Exteremely knowledgeable about art history and makes class so much fun. It can be a pretty boring subject but he kept me interested throughout the entire class. Not a hard grader at all, just wants you to know the subject. I would take any class he was teaching</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2009<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pohlad is one of the best. very helpful, very straighforward, jokes around in class and is very interesting. The class basically consists of a midterm, final, one 2pg ppr and a 7 pg ppr at the end.Grades the papers easy. tells u what is on the final and mid term. Take Him, this is a great class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2009<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So good. I love Art History -- but, still, do you know how hard it is to keep a three-hour Art History class interesting&#63; I don't know how he does it.

Not too hard, just get your stuff done.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2009<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher I've had at DePaul so far. I had him for Architecture and every class was a great experience. He's extremely helpful, and very easy to talk to outside of class. He's a pretty moderate grader, if you attend all the classes and take notes you're guaranteed at least a B+</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2009<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mark is a great teacher who will help you get started at DePaul.. i took him for discover chicago architecture..

He knows what he's talking about and isn't boring to listen to, either, which is important in lecture. Participate in class, he appriciates that. I would suggest going to every class you can because he highlights what you need to know in the book, which isn't everything. Recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2008<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>amazing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2007<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a great professor--he loves people who can critique or analyze things.

He is very knowledgable about photography but seems to think he knows everything. He is very opinionated and thinks he is always right. He is a hard grader on papers so start papers before the due date and let him read the draft. Not the worst teacher at DePaul but not the best. If you need to take the class it is bearable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2007<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took him for achitecture class.
