However, the amount of reading is ridiculous. She expects you to spend 3 hours for every hour in class, thats fair enough, but the reading and preparation for class will take you more like 6 hours a day. She made russian history way more difficult than it should be.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2008<br>Class Name: HIS421<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Demanding course, but this is college.  She put forth a rigorous syllabus.  Because of the course, however, I am better prepared to succeed in the future than I was before.

Shes friendly but that will go away if u fall anything short of her expectations from you. Definetly not a walk in the park - must put in time and effort. Shes respectful but challenging and tough.

But this was one of the most rewarding classes I have taken; I learned a ton. If you take her class, keep up with the readins (cant stress that enough), if you do that then youll be fine. She is very helpful if you go see her after class so do it.

She had moments of coarseness towards us but only rarely.  Generally a personable, articulate, incredibly intelligent, patient professor.
