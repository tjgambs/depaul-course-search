If you do the optional homework questions, do the readings and show up to his class, you should be fine.

Dr. D made the stuff very interesting and even fun. He is a true diamond in the rough. He is dedicated and has his own org. website to help students. If you put the effort it(2 hrs a day) you'll get A's like I did.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2008<br>Class Name: ORGCHEM<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Dr. D for organic way back in 2000!  He was, without a doubt, the best science prof at DePaul...and there were a lot of good ones to choose from.  He's smart, funny, patient, and caring.  He's got a really great vocabulary, too...lots of big words!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2008<br>Class Name: CHE171<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr.D is a really good teacher. His voice can be monotone, but the material is interesting and well presented. Orgo is hard work, but he is very fair. Go to class every day, do the homework, get decent grades in lab, and study hardcore for tests and you will get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2007<br>Class Name: CHE171<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is amazingly helpful.

Complete the homework assignments for extra credit on the first 3 exams not the final. Nonetheless, he tended to write for too long on the board ignoring people with questions. Review the notes and complete the homework assignments and you'll do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2007<br>Class Name: CHE171<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome prof!

He is always prepared, encourages questions and is a fair test giver/grader.  He only concern is that you understand what is going on. Many pple in class think orgo will be their best section on med/dental tests.

Papers were pertinent to the material and largely based on personal opinions. It would be hard to do poorly. Just a tip - express your opinions often. Also he pushed our final paper back several times due to our high stress-level. As long as you make an effort, he is happy to work with you as far as deadlines go.
