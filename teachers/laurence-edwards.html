If you are remotely interested in the class, you will probably do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: REL268<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sweet, lovable guy! Rabbi Edwards is extremely caring and completely understanding towards his students. Easy class - but like the other rater said, lectures are extremely boring. Wish he would have added some experiential learning or activities to liven it up. All around great guy, though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2011<br>Class Name: CTH212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kind of hard not to get a good grade in this class: 6 quizzes, 3 2-3 pg, papers, and one final. Very lenient when it comes to grading and gives study guides. Extremely nice, but the class is a bit on the dull side (he just lectures). One of the easiest teachers.</div></div></div></body></html>
