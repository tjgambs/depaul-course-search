Gives insight of working in the marketing and advertising field. Requires you to bring an article in every class, and only gives out 4 quizzes. Other than that, it is a midterm, group project, and a final. Would recommend on taking his class! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2015<br>Class Name: PRAD244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Leff is a veteran in the advertising world, so expect a little arrogance but awesome insight on marketing/adv/PR. He reiterates a lot of examples during lecture, which I think is a good way to remember concepts. There is a midterm, final and group project. Also a couple minor quizzes and you have to turn in an article each class! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2015<br>Class Name: 244<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Everyone ranted and raved about him, and yet during my class, I thought he was one of the worst professors I've had at DePaul. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2015<br>Class Name: PRAD334<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>This was the second class I took that he taught and it was just as good as the first. Mr. Leff has some really funny stories and is always trying to engage the class. He is very knowledgeable in his field and tells it like it is. There was a minimal amount of homework which was nice. Take him if you want an easy A, he's the man!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2014<br>Class Name: PRAD244<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Leff is great. He is so knowledgable in his field and enthusiastic and always wants to know if were learning. When you email him questions, his responses are a bit short and vague. Overall though, he is a really great guy and really cares about his students. He does not take attendance but to do well you need to show up.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2014<br>Class Name: PRAD244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bright man, very intelligent,entertaining and interesting.
