You may want to bring a laptop, but it's not totally necessary, however a lot of info is online so I find it helps with note taking. The tests are awesome because she lets you know exactly what to study. If you study, you'll do well. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2014<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice  Professor. She can be unorganized and moves fast with lectures. Overall, she is a good and easy professor. If you are an obnoxious student you are not welcome in her class. Oh, if you do not show up to class, that is a hit on your grade. There is only one test (midterm) a group project and a final paper of 8 pages.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2014<br>Class Name: 101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall she's an average professor. Only one test through out the quarter. Really unorganized and sometimes contradicting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2013<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was my first class at DePaul and it was pointless. I have no idea what I learned. She moved really fast through the power points, rarely discussed the readings, and didn't explain the final paper or the group project. The class was a joke.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can confirm what the previous student posted. She tells you to go to the reading reserve to find the reading but half the time it isn't even there, so she just tells you to catch up, which can be very cumbersome. Do yourself a  favor and take someone more organized.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is very easy and frustrating at the same time. Let me explain why. First of all, she gives you too much busywork. The readings are easy but there are just too many of them. Second of all, many of the readings are in the E-reserve but most of the time the readings are nowhere to be found or the E-reserve site is down.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Acts as though her class is the most important one we are taking even though it is a sophomore seminar, does not provide adequate explanation for longer assignments on the syllabus or on D2L, easy grader but the class is a nuisance and material is extremely repetitive. Given the choice, I would not take Prof. Khalifeh again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2013<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lots of busy work. Never explains anything well. Only good thing is there is no final. Group project is not well explained at all and most of the class is just working on it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2013<br>Class Name: SOC381<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an okay teacher. She cancels ALOT of classes for you to meet in your groups. She has other students teaching other students within the groups. She seems to be an easy grader but dont take it for granted.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2013<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interesting class.

Very interesting topics and discussion. Assignments include reading articles & answering a few easy questions, book report &final presentation, and a final paper which is more of a reflection paper.Nice lady,tries to make you THINK about real world issues, which is refreshing from other "memorize facts" classes</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2012<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Khalifeh was a good teacher.

Very easy grader. If you get your work done, than she'll give you a good grade. Also she will try to help you out a lot so you get a good grade.

But she doesn't lecture all the time, and encourages working with others which is nice.  She's not too hard of a grader so as long as you do what's required you can get a good grade pretty easily.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>if you have a problem getting something in on time or understanding something from a lecture, she is very helpful and understanding.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2010<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's alright, pretty easy for the most part. The lectures get kind of boring and she gives out a lot of &quot;busy work&quot;, but I found a lot of the topics interesting anyway. Not bad overall.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/12/2010<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this class.  Although, I do think she provided a lot of busy work (daily assignments & quiz's).  I suppose it was because it was an 8am class, but as long as you read the material she assigns you will do great!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2010<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>2 exams;easy group project; 1 final paper (a reflection of what you learned in the class ect.) She almost scared me out of her class on the first day, but I stuck through it and got an A (a  surprise b/c I got a B on both exams) The exams cover A LOT of material (multiple choice); the group project was easy and fun; I learned a lot;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2009<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her for Soc 101 and it was super easy! All we did was take practice qzs online (not graded) and and watch documentaries. I think she lectured once. 20% of your grade is a group project that took about 45 minutes to complete. My group got a 96%. She's very clear, and doesn't have an accent. Attendance is graded, but you can just sleep.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2009<br>Class Name: SOC290<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is rude, condescending and wears every emotion on her face. this class is supposed to be about the arab world adn most we do is watch youtube videos. the class lacks structure, academic and theoretical depth. its an easy grade if you can stand tedious, pointless assignments,  reading not worth while, and her VOICE for 10 weeks,</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2009<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT  TEACHER!

She teaches like it is a high school class: attendance is mandatory, exercises are tidious, tests contain questions not covered in the material...  She is not very approachable for extra help, questions, or concerns nor is she flexibile or willing to work with you if anything comes up.  You can teach yourself better than she can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2009<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes an OK teacher. She very intimidating and not very approachable. Theres a quiz every week on the chapters/articles read. Theres a lot of reading. No final, just a final paper.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/01/2009<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She a O.K teacher. Make sure you READ EVERYTHING SHE GIVES YOU. She quizzes every friday on chapters that were 50 pages long. If you don't enjoy reading every night you might want to try another teacher. She is very stern and not alot of fun.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2008<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was like high school. I love sociology but Prof. Khalifeh just has you read repetitive stuff. Its basically impossible to do well on the tests unless you memorize the book! Also, a kid next to me was talking to me during class once...she totally embarrassed us for it and picked on me for the rest of the quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2008<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>we have a test every friday. 2 or more articles and questions every week. along with a journal entry. you basically teach yourself everything. she dont go over anything useful. attendance is mandatory.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2008<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really hated this teacher and this class. Her voice is annoying and every class was like a trip back to high school. Had to drag myself to class because attendance was mandatory. I would not recommend this woman.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2008<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was ok. There were too many words to memorize. Some articles just made me sleep. The class felt really boring. It was like I was falling asleep all the time. Some stuff were interesting but others were too boring. I didn't like it. TOO MUCH READING, most are boring. She's nice though. Take another professor if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2008<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>all busy work, lots of group work, 2 essays-which are really reviews for the test. just type the Qs + ans. all easy stuff. u can read the terms & review at end of each chap & pass the tests.

She treats you like a freshman in high school.  Be ready to teach yourself and read a bunch of worthless articles.  You literally have to drag yourself to class and attendance is madatory.  She doesn't really get anything and her reflection papers are basically a huge waste of time.  Take someone else if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2008<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Felt like I was in highschool again.  Alot of overhead-outline use.  NO ONE participated. She was not engaging at all.  The class was pretty straightforward and easy to pass but you have to drag yourself in.

It is only an A if you GO to class, and STUDY for the tests/quizzes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2005<br>Class Name: SOC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>easy A but if u want the A show up to class,she grades by a point system, 3multiple choice tests(240) 2 quizzes(100) and final paper(100), attendance and participation is 60 points, nice lady but the class is so easy it's boring,common sense stuff, don't think u can show up for the test and that's it, atleast come to class once a week.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2005<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is all busy work.
