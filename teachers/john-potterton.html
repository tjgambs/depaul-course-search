He did not cover any of the topics that we were tested on, nor did he relate anything from the book to the materials presented in class. He does not like PowerPoint or using any kind of outlines for his students. He disregards what they have to say.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2011<br>Class Name: HSP350<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am a Hospitality minor in event management, and I was looking forward to taking this class. needless to say this class was terrible thanks to the professor his teaching style is poor and disregards anything his students have to say and I was even more disappointed to learn that he is teaching HSP 354 ( I will NOT be taking that class)</div></div></div></body></html>
