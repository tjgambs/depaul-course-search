Couldn't really understand him and everytime you asked him something that slightly contradicted his thinking he would look at you with an egocentric grin and not answer what you had to say---NOT A GOOD PROF.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: PHL234<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow, difficult and a lot of work.

Worst prof at depaul for sure.  dude just sits there and reads of some paper to you, what an awful teacher.  lots of reading and he grades hard as hell on papers.  cant understand what he is saying and nobody ever talks in class, soo boring.  don't let the high ratings fool you he sucks.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2006<br>Class Name: PHL234<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Too much work for a class that is NOT in my major.  Too much reading, too many papers and the presentation with a paper was a bit much.  I understand work must be done- this is college- but it could have been better.  Honestly the best part was the trip to the prison. Would never do it again but it was a valuable experience. Take him but beware.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2006<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didnt know crap about philosophy and really still dont know much but got an A. So I guess if you show up do the work right his papers its all good. Really not that tough of a grader if you use common sense.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/20/2006<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was quite an experience! I got more out of this class then I expected. Tough grader thouhg!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/20/2006<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a hard grader and we had to write a lot for this class. I had to work hard, but learned a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2005<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is a cool teacher.  very easy...all you do is read the chapters and he goes over them in class.  there is a few papers due but the class over all was a breeze. there are also in class assignments so attendance is important.  easy A! TAKE HIM</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a character. I would def. recommend him. All you do for hw is read, which isnt even necessary bc the reading is hard to understand and he goes over everything. He has somewhat of an accent. And in a wierd kinda way...hes kinda cute. lol. just take him. He's awesome and really helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You don't get any homework except to read. If you don't read, don't worry because we go over everything in class.  This quarter, we'll have had three graded assignments, two easy papers, and one relatively easy final. Also, the prof. seemed really weird at first, but now he's cool with everyone and makes weird but funny jokes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2005<br>Class Name: PHL234<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>what a crazy guy. i was a little worried about this class at first, but gerard is nothing to be afraid of. the class was a little boring and he didn't seem very comfortable talking in front of the class. he also seemed like he was making up things as he went along. easy grader, the quizzes don't count for anything, paper, no tests, i got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2005<br>Class Name: PHL234<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think that he is a very intelligent professor. I  almost enjoyed being in his class. Besides a few pop-up quizes PHL 234 is a great class. The amount of work is reasonable (no midterm) + Prof. Kuperus is a fair grader. He really tries to make his class fun and I think that we have to appriciate that. Personally, I would have take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2005<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ehhh doesn't seem like he knows what he is doing at all... he can be fun at times, but i wouldn't really recommend him.. also a bizarre grading system</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/08/2004<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take him for Business Management. He is a marxist and thus has a pretty biased view against business. You watch a bloody Michael More movie in class. Came in looking to learn and left with a bunch of quotes by marx.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A nice guy, but very boring. I had a hard time convincing myself to go to the night class. He seems to expect a lot, but then grades easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2004<br>Class Name: MGT223<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>boring and unclear</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2004<br>Class Name: PHL234<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He gives you a good explanation of things. He encourages participation. He grades people pretty easy as long as you don't act like an idiot in class. Do the homework and just be on his good side.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2004<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Laid back professor, doesn't do anything. Voice your opinion in class discussion often, but beware on assignments, he's the kind that you should write what he wants to hear.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2004<br>Class Name: PHIL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2004<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Deceptively hard. He requires a lot for the essays but is a very easy grader. Class activities and videos were very good. I recommend, but do not take the night class.
