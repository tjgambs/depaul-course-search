Shoots down a lot of answers in class and doesn't have real managerial experience. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2015<br>Class Name: MGT335<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>He thinks his class is the most important class at DePaul. Be prepared for unclear projects and impossible multiple choice tests. He has no real world experience outside of DePaul and expects way too much from his students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2015<br>Class Name: MGT335<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Need hearing aids after this class. He pretty much screams the entire lecture. Oh and every class is made up of one solid, long lecture. AVOID</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/21/2015<br>Class Name: MGT335<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow that project though..... Most unclear assignment I have ever had. Do not take this class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/19/2015<br>Class Name: MGT335<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>One of those teachers that assigns a project that is ridiculous and then proceeds to only teach about that project the rest of the quarter. Project is worthless. Would be better off giving lectures and TEACHING about the actual topics. He is extremely passionate about HR and believes you are just as passionate as he is. No real take away here...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2014<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's dedicated to the topic. He loves it and therefore expects you to be respectful and attentive during class. Therefore, attendance does count toward your final grade. Has a group project that lasts all quarter, it's not too bad but if you absolutely hate group projects then consider elsewhere.  Tests are mostly multiple choice and short essay.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2014<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>The subject is easy but he acts like its difficult. He explains the same thing over and over but never actually explains what you need to know. He loves answering questions but his answers are just questions. He is a stickler for his grading but won't give a rubric unless asked for. Overall you can get a decent grade but be annoyed while doing it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2014<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Koys is an adorable older man who loves his job and really cares about this class.  Towards the end of the quarter his lectures are a little hard to sit through because they're so boring... but overall the class is not hard at all!  Just pay attention in class, fill in the notes he gives you, and study for mid-term and final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2014<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Though the lectures and class aren't the most entertaining, Professor Koys tries his best to keep everyone engaged. Main grade comes from midterm and final, there are also a few assignments. Not a hard class but to get an A requires some effort. Overall recommend. (Here's another chili pepper for you)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2014<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>He really enjoys giving class, is clear, the only thing i have to say is that you shouldn't get the book for this class, its useless. Here's your hot chili pepper Prof. Koys</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2014<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy, very clear with the material.  He's a little rigid with his grading system so don't screw anything up.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2014<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>He's a great teacher and explained to the class that he is waiting for the day he gets a hot chili pepper.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2014<br>Class Name: MGT250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Veryyyyyyyy tough grader, but it's necessary in the long run to prepare you for a real job. Guy knows what he's talking about and can teach you some very important stuff. Take him if you get the chance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2013<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>funny guy, good class, i highly recommend it. simulation is a blast</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2012<br>Class Name: MGT307<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the worst. Biggest pansy I have ever met, doesn't explain how the tests will be, the simulation is a waste of time. May be different for MGT 300, but for 307 I suggest anyone else over him. Didn't learn a thing and I now hate HR</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2012<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy but pointless assignments.  Super annoying and does not motivate. Knows nothing about other professions but management. He is boring and does not clarify his directions on his assignments. Do not even try to argue with him he will not let you get a word in and your always wrong. Oh if your stuck with him set all your career goals LOW.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2012<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His undergrad course must be much better than his graduate course. Zero structure to MGT 555 course. He seemed proud of the fact that he does not have any real world experience outside academia.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2011<br>Class Name: MNG307<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is really nice! He clearly explains what he wants, gives you a lot of hints. For an A read the textbook!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2011<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>hes an easy professor. not too much work 3 assignments that are pointless and 3 tests. he is overly picky and extremely annoying to listen to. i wouldn't recommend him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2011<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor. 3 writing assignments and 3 tests. Being extremely helpful is an understatement; don't be afraid to go see him during office hours. Outside examples are not the greatest (they all relate to DePaul). Easy A if you put the effort into it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2011<br>Class Name: MGT335<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Basically reads from the PP.  Attendance does not affect grade. He is a very nice guy and will go up and beyond to help his students. There are two projects and two tests. I would recommend him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2010<br>Class Name: MGT307<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>3 tests, 4 written assignments. Class consists of just lecture, just show up even if youre not paying attention. You need to read the book since he doesnt go over everything from each chapter thatll be on the tests. Not very difficult if you put some time into it. Do your best on the papers, theyre easy but are each worth like 15%. Recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2010<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>3 tests, 3 written assignments.Tests are very easy if you go over his handouts.Assignments are stupid, but easy.He does subtract points for the dumbest things, but oh well.He doesnt count attendance, but if you dont go dont expect him to be generous when time for grading comes.Lectures are boring, but all you have to do is show up and hell remember</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2010<br>Class Name: MGT307<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very smart guy and always up-to-date with his stuff. Enjoys to lecture and enjoys working with students. Highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2010<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's too bad enough ppl haven't rated him. He is repetitive and not at all up to date with students. He enjoys taking points of student's homework and will not explain why. He needs to get out of his own little bubble.  Attendance is not mandatory, class extremely boring because all lecture/powerpoints. Tests are right out of the powerpoints.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2010<br>Class Name: MGT307<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very smart professor. Teaches you a lot. Gives you guidelines for the 5 assignments, and study outline for the 5 quizzes. Review his handouts & read the textbook if you want an A on the quizzes. No attendance policy. Ask qustions to make the class more interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2009<br>Class Name: MGT307<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nicest professor. He tries to use the class to prepare you for finding a job after graduation so you atleast get something out of it. Lectures can get a little boring, but he does the best he can with the topic, HR. Grade is 50% homework and 50% quizzes. Quizzes and homework are every other week. Quizzes are harder than you expect so read the text.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2005<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst educational experience I've ever had (even though I recieved an A).  It's not that he's unintellegent - he just lacks the ability to look outside his own limited understanding and framework.  Also - grades very subjectively and will belittle the class at times.</div></div></div></body></html>
