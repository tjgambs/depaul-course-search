She's willing to help you out on your spare time. She gives you a list with all the possible assignments and with your possible grade. Basically based off the assignments you choose to do, get you the grade you want. I highly remcommend her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2006<br>Class Name: RELSECT<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sucked.  Tried so hard to make things interesting but would always just make things complicated.  Her readings were boring and she never really &quot;taught&quot; she had us present and get in groups and talk about what we read.  Unbelievably boring and had too much work that was unecessary</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2006<br>Class Name: REL291<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's fantastic ! if you are willing to study, im sure u will get a good grade on her class. and some of her material is really interesting (especiall about the tortilla and the movie speech session).. I highly reccomend u to take her class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2006<br>Class Name: REL103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The whole class was a bunch of nonsense. The three text books were a bunch of nonsense. She's a feminist that likes to talk in an incoherent language. It's true you can choose what assaignments to do, and can predict your grade based off of that. BUT A RIDICULOUS AMOUNTS OF POINTS ARE NEEDED FOR AN A. THIS CLASS WAS A ROYAL WASTE OF MY TIME.</div></div></div></body></html>
