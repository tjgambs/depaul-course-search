She connected things to the world.  She was incredible and her course was one of my favorite that I have taken, and I hated philosophy before her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/20/2011<br>Class Name: PHL232<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Birmingham is an overall wonderful person. Make sure you take notes in class and read over them before quizzes. I would highly recommend her to anyone. I took my first philosophy class ever with her and thoroughly enjoyed it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2009<br>Class Name: PHL230<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Birmingham is a very kind professor. Her exams are not extremely difficult since a lot of the answers are covered in her lectures. Although there was no required textbook in the class, we were required to read 6 books. If you take her, be sure to speak loud and clear and make your point heard because she seems to have trouble hearing sometimes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2007<br>Class Name: CTH240<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really do not enjoy Philosophy whatsoever, so I hated this class.  She was a really tough grader too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2007<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super relaxed atmosphere!  Exactly how you want your philosophy class to be.  She might seem like a space case, but she knows what she's talking about.  She just wants you to figure it out for yourself instead of having it spelled out for you.  If your brain is geared towards that kind of thinking, try to get her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2007<br>Class Name: PHIL206<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you love philosophy, and it's your life or your major, take her class.  If you don't care much about philosophy, or are indifferent about it, take her class. She's crazy intense about everything, and you HAVE to come to class to understand anything, and even if you never miss class (like me) you still won't know what is going on.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2007<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice, if you have a problem with your grades she is very helpful and is very understanding....she loves participation...its 20% of the grade!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2007<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Birmingham is one of the most interesting and enthusiastic professors I have ever had.  She makes the concepts easy to understand, and is always available to talk to.  Takes drafts of papers and is not a hard grader.  She is great!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2006<br>Class Name: PHL300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>provides salient anecdotal examples to help augment her lectures.

She is a horrible teacher who assigns way too many books, rushes thru the material, and grades hard. Seriously unless you actually want to work your ass off, or kiss hers, DO NOT take her as a professor.  She has made me hate philosophy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2006<br>Class Name: FOCALPOINT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very intelligent, interesting teacher and class. She is a little flighty, but I enjoy her class a lot. She assigned a million and one books, but you dont really have to read any of them. Discussion based class, and whatever is talked about in class is what you need to know for papers/final!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the class is about freud and other philosophers...not what i expected...generally easy 2 presentations, 2 essays, and a final, but 9 books to read durnign the qtr...n we get to all of em!!! teh class is alot of discussion, i would not recomend</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2005<br>Class Name: PHL200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class during Winter Intersession and I highly recommend it!

She assigned about ten books for the class and expected everyone to have read them all. Very helpful and clear, but be prepared to do a lot of reading. O yea, and participate a lot in class, that really helps.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2005<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Okay, the lady is nice! The work is okay, the material interesting. Her expectations were freakin unrealistic! All I have to say she isn't a tough grader, but swallowing what she expects takes a couple of glasses of water!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2004<br>Class Name: PHLEVIL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought that she was very interesting.
