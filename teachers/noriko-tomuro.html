Her assignments aren't too difficult. Tests are on computers. Its not easy, but then again no 300 level CSC class is</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2014<br>Class Name: CSC309<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: Rather not say</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is an extremely hard grader. The assignments are very difficult and there are 2 test (final and midterm). She is not very clear and thinks we are all experts in C++ making it a very hard class. Don't take it if you don't have to, TRUST ME. She takes long to respond to emails as well and her extra credit assignments are worth nothing</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2012<br>Class Name: CSC261<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tomuro is a very nice teacher. The notes of the lecture is clear and she did a lot to help students understand the problem and finish the homework.Select her class if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2012<br>Class Name: CSC261<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this online and I found it really difficult. The midterm average for online was 62 for the whole class. I would suggest taking it in class because online made it so much harder. She's not too bad of a teacher. I found that a lot of the class examples did not relate to the home work enough and that made it hard. Shes a pretty fair grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2011<br>Class Name: CSC393<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice teacher, hard grader, accent is frustrating at times because when you're already having trouble with the topic missing words hurts.  However, that and her hard grading on HW are really the only two missteps you can point out.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2009<br>Class Name: CSC578<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her course was tough and she was strict when graded homework. She cannot explain very well in words. Maybe she's not a good speaker. Anyway, Prof. Noriko is great. She give a lot of details about what's wrong in my homework. Also, when I emailed her to ask questions. She quickly responded and explain very clearly. I love this professor so much ^^</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2009<br>Class Name: CSC578<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very friendly and helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2008<br>Class Name: CSC262<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you had a hard time learning C++ or struggled a bit in 261, this is the class for you!  Amazing teacher that knows what shes talking about.  One of the fairest graders I have ever had.  And guess what, if you need help, SHE WILL ACTUALLY HELP YOU UNDERSTAND IT.  Do yourself a favor TAKE this teacher for 262 and I promise you wont regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/17/2007<br>Class Name: CSC262<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I got so much more out of this class (C++ 2) than I did with C++ 1.  While she can be difficult to understand, she posts all of the notes on a web site which is organized and always up to date.  She is pretty forgiving on homework assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2006<br>Class Name: CSC578<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has a very nice personality and she is very helpful.But I found her presentations rather confusing.She mixes the books slides with additional things and her presentation is not straight forward. I think she can say the same things in easier way without puzzeling it so much.However, I like the course and it was good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2006<br>Class Name: HCI<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>FREAKEN COOL TEACHER...COOL ACCENT, AND SHE IS SMART AND FUNNY...NIGHT CLASS WAS NOT BAD AT ALL AND THE HW IS NOT BORING!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2006<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i love her personality! shes very easy going which makes class less stressful. sometimes lectures were a little boring, but i didnt mind so much. shes really understanding. i would take her again for sure!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2006<br>Class Name: CSC262<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tomuro is the best teacher I have ever had. Not only did I learn alot from her class, but I also have it memorized. She teaches everything in detail in class and she also assigns a fair amount of homework that forces you to apply the topics that you are learning. For each assignment, she gives a thorough explanation of what you need to do and how.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2005<br>Class Name: CSC578<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, however, class is a little bit too easy for a 500-level class.  She is passionate at her stuff and knows it very well.  One of the best teachers at DePaul. - And one of the teachers who dares not to give away the solution of an assignment before its due date.  The homework assignments are fun but a lot of work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/20/2005<br>Class Name: CSC578<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Does not understand the foundations of the topic and has a hard time explaining concepts logically.  Many topics are simply presented as fact and when asked to elaborate, she cannot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2005<br>Class Name: IPD399<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I went with her on an international trip to Japan and if it wasn't for her I, along with 1/2 the group, wouldn't have had any fun at all. She is very friendly and a great teacher in almost everything Japan. Simply awesome. Take this class if you just need an elective to graduate or for fun =)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2005<br>Class Name: CSC309<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tomuro is a good prof but a little boring, i know it is the matterial but she doesn't break it up and make it a little fun. Not a easy class for sure. You will need to program day and night to really understand C++.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: CSC252<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, she explains everything very thoroughly and often repeats herself so it is hard to not understand what she's talking about. Her midterm was exactly what we have been studying, there were no surprises. I'd take her for another class if I got the chance</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/27/2004<br>Class Name: CSC309<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teaching style. Made sure we all understood projects and used some snippets of code to get us started.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/17/2004<br>Class Name: CS417<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>2 years since I took her classes; she explained and demonstrated tough CS topics very well, despite non-native speaker. I wish she/her teaching style and capabilities were used for discrete math (BTW, I hate math profs because they demean non-math people)</div></div></div></body></html>
