Dr. Suglia still treated me as if I participated daily, and he gave helpful feedback on all my papers.  He typically answers emails within ten minutes, so if you need a question answered it isn't a drag to reach out. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/10/2015<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>LISTEN UP.  Dr. Suglia is a REAL scholar.  He wrote Table 41 the novel.  If you read Table 41, you will surely understand why Dr. Suglia is the greatest writing professor at DePaul. He is more than willing to meet with students outside of the classroom (even on weekends).  Take WRD 103 with him, if you can. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/30/2015<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>He is absolutely brilliant.

Although I did learn something from him, I would say I wrote too much in this class. I spent to much time in this unimportant class. For people who want to get their English credit out of their way DO NOT TAKE HIM.  Find someone else. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2015<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Dr Suglia....3 papers due he is a hard grader, but gives you extensions, allows you to redo your papers for higher grade, 2 extremely simple quizzes, and just come to every class...I got an A!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2015<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Suglia is really passionate about English. He offers extensions on papers, and only have three papers to write the whole quarter. Two quizzes on the readings he assigns, but they're easy if you read. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2015<br>Class Name: 103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>He is the best teacher I have ever had.

Go to class, talk about examples of certain pieces and then you have a week to write an essay.  You email him your paper and he sends you a grade. You can ask for an extension if you'r busy and he also lets you revise your paper for a better grade after listing things you need to correct.  Easy A very nice professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lets you re-do every assignment you've ever done all quarter: quizzes, papers, assignments. Also gives extensions if you ask! You do have something to do every week for this class but its really hard to not do well in his class.

There is an essay every week, which sucks, but it is doable.  Final portfolio is a huge part of grade and you must attend class, or you will miss a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>His lectures are long but great! If you ever need an extension on a paper all you have to do is ask BOFORE the assignment is due. He is my favorite professor at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very enthusiastic about his lectures.

SO passionate about things that there is literally no possibility of falling asleep in class. He grades very fairly with options to make corrections, which is SUPER generous. Has some very unique (and strong) opinions and is willing to explain them to his students. Overall, I learned a ton.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The instructor was enthusiastic and energetic about subject matter. During lectures he can be ambiguous about directions and expectations. Professor Suglia was extremely helpful with suggestions and helping writers find sources. He was a bit anal about small literary, grammatical, and spelling errors. Assignments were not weighted fairly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Suglia is a great professor. Unlike many teachers at DePaul, I actually learned how to become a better writer under his instruction. He's extremely passionate and cares about the success of each student.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's really one of the best writing teachers I've ever had. He's more than willing to customize the class to your interests. Also very willing to go the extra mile as far as reviewing your papers before you turn them in.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice guy, and extremely passionate for writing and teaching. He definitely needs to manage his time better though. He is very cultured and knows a lot. He makes class not a drag, because the only project is about the topic of your choice, and he helps you out strongly.Is very strict on english language usage. Good professor overall. Good luck!</div></div></div></body></html>
