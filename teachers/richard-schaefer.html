He is such a boring boring boring teacher.  I don't understand why there are happy faces for him.  He does not teach anything outside of what is written in the book, but still requires attendence in class.

Yes, the reading and homework is time consuming (so learn time management, duh), but not difficult. Those who failed or found him too &quot;hard&quot; are slackers. Study=easy test=good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2008<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Im not sure why people are stating his class is not hard. This class is extremely HARD for a 101. It is very interesting and 3 papers are easy, but the exams are HARD! You have to study and attendance is mandatory.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2007<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>cool and fun teacher..he wrote the book we use so he knows what he's talking about..3 papers, bonus is available..takes attendance and about one chap. of reading due per class. very funny and makes class interesting with his own examples. very clear and power points help us follow along</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2007<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i liked this class...its not hard. just go to class(he takes attendance) and turn in the assignments on time. ther are only 3 papers and 3 tests...NO FINAL!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2007<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HE is really funny.

He helped me with some questions I had and cleared them up. He also gave us TWO extra credit papers we could write instead of one so we could boost our grade. I thought the class was interesting and he made me laugh</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2006<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy class...two papes required for the whole quarter..and they consist of answering questins. Just do the reading and you'll definately get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2006<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy enough class.  Just keep up with reading... no hard studying required really, just read through the sections.  The workbook really helps a lot.  He is quite generous with grading; he even allowed more extra credit because he felt the class needed it.  2 required &quot;papers&quot; are a piece of cake- just answering questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2006<br>Class Name: HONORS300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked Dr. Schaefer. The material was very fascinating, had 2 papers and 2 exams. THe papers weren't hard but beware of the definitions on the exam. They can easily add up to a letter grade difference. That's why I suggest keeping up with the reading, in addition to the class notes (good notes too not crappy ones) and you will get an A out of him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/19/2006<br>Class Name: SOC401<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was a graduate course and I really truly felt like he gave me a better grade than I deserved!  He had fun videos to watch, we skipped a few classes for one reason or another, and he let us go early every night we had class.  I think he was one of the best teachers ever....maybe it helps that he used to be the Sociology chair!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2005<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is kind of annoying and the class is boring. The book does not get interesting until half way through it. It is an easy A if you spend hours studying the text(I would suggest the work book also, saves time) and he does offer extra credit. The class is not good or bad just a class. Spend time knowing all the vocab, words terrible grade scale.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2005<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Schaefer is a very nice man and he tries to make the class exciting, but the material is introductory material, mostly definitions; So, I think he does the best he can with the material he has. Just beware your grade is only based off of 3 tests. They arent excruciating, so if you study, the class is an easy A. Plus there is easy extra credit.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2005<br>Class Name: SOCIOLOGY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The classes only seem long because he lectures for an hour and a half but at least the material isn't that hard and somewhat interesting. He's a sweet old guy that cares about what he is teaching. He also gives you extra credit opportunities! There are only 3 tests but not bad at all!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2005<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the most boring class I have ever taken.  The tests are ridiculously hard and there are only 3, so study really hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2004<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BORING, he definitly has favorites and what he says will be on the 3 exams he gives is never what is really on them, STUDY STUDY STUDY for his exams</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2004<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His tests are ridiculous and and if you get lower than an A on one you get less than an A for the quarter. Boring as hell too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2004<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved the class at first- but it became harder and harder to stay awake during it. If you do take his class, make sure you have a couple shots of espresso in you before you go. His tests we're only easy after some serious reviewing and I could do without the monotonous voice..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2004<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You folks are failing to mention that this man actually wrote the textbook. Open the front cover and you'll see a picture of his smiling Irish face. Yes, this man knows what he's talking about and saying that, you know that his lectures won't deviate from the text b/c he wrote it. Study hard, ace it</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2004<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Be prepared to do a lot of reading! He is a really good teacher and loves sociology so he keeps the class interesting. The text is actually quite good and he explains every aspect of it clearly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2004<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this class. It was so damn interesting. Most of the lectures in class are right from the book and most of the questions on the tests are too. Also, he tells you exactly what to study for the tests.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2004<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OK, might be boring at days, but this man is WISE and knows SO much more than you think. Interesting topics and is very aware of how the world acts and behaves.  Tests are EZ if you pay attention ;) only 2 tests, final. interesting subject...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2004<br>Class Name: SOC<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BORING, BORING, BORING, that's all I have to say. Who cares if he wrote the book, he's a terrible teacher. Just cause you write a book doesn't make you a good teacher. Do NOT take him...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2004<br>Class Name: HON204<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>so...the assignments are creative, but his grading sucks. i'm convinced he picks favorites, and if you're not one of them, you're screwed...even if you really work hard...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2004<br>Class Name: HON204<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It wasn't a hard class by any means although it could have been a bit more interesting.

The assignments were challenging but creative, and allowed me to see parts of the city I normally wouldn't have visited.  An overall good experience.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2004<br>Class Name: SOC1<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok... lets just say he's brought in playboy to show the class.

This guy may have an ego the size of Texas but he earned it! The man wrote the textbook and did the research. Great class! Great teacher!

The fact that he wrote the book and STILL has so much junk to say makes his class so boring.  Everyone fell asleep in this class.  One midterm, a final, and two papers.

Honestly my 12 yr old brother could write a better book than he did.The worst part about it is he rarely tested over the material we covered in class.
