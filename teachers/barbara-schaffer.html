She's smart and doesn't lecture on the topic before you write the essays but she lets you think for yourself and encourages class discussion. come to class, pay attention and do your rewrites. you will ace it. she changed the way i think.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2008<br>Class Name: ENGSECT<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Love her, she is amazing.

Thinks way too highly of herself, and is not at all kind.  AVOID HER!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/09/2004<br>Class Name: AMS250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A tough grader but allows (and encourages) rewrites for everything, so her criticisms are helpful for papers. Very energetic and passionate about subjects covered- it was obvious that she really enjoys her students and teaching. I'd take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2004<br>Class Name: AMS250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice, helpful, and picky. Lots of reading for this class and 3 papers (including a final). She will let you rewrite your papers, but is really detailed in what she wants. Overall, she is down-to-earth and pretty cool if you get to know her.  8.5/10</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2004<br>Class Name: HON100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A great teacher, even though she's not the brightest woman in the world.

She teaches like a high school teacher. Yelled at some kid for not taking notes during a movie... Also does the re-write on EVERY paper thing to force more work out of students. THIS IS COLLEGE, LADY!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2004<br>Class Name: WMSAMS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's fantastic. she'll rip you a new one with the papers but you can rewrite them as many times as you want and it doesn't matter if you turn them in late. she actually cares about her students and is really easy to talk to outside of class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2004<br>Class Name: WMSAMS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>one of the best at depaul. very cool, if a bit flighty at times. her classes are fascinating and you will learn a lot, and though she's a very tough grader on papers, she'll let you do a rewrite and if she likes you, she doesn't care much about deadlines.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2004<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is brilliant and a good amount of challenging.
