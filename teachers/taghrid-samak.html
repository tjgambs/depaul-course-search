Would not recommend. Is too quite and incomprehensible.

She is pretty funny, but kind of quiet. I'd recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2010<br>Class Name: LSPLSP<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was pretty easy,but  by the first week you'll want to hit your head against a brick wall. She explains things in a way that is easy to follow, but when she answers the same questions over and over to that one students that &quot;just&quot; can't get it the simply but time consuming activities will get on your nerves. Bring a pillow and blanket.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2010<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, very helpful. Provides a very straight forward approach to the material. No projects, just short homework and in class assignments. Midterm and Final were easy. No one should have a problem doing well in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2010<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hated this class but I loved Taghrid. She is so cute and helpful. Knowing that she was always going to be helpful and grade you fairly made suffering through a class completely uninteresting to me tolerable.</div></div></div></body></html>
