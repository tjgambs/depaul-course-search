You don't have to buy the book, but you must attend every lecture becasue that is what the tests are based on.  Essay questions aren't that hard.  35% of your grade is based on a research paper.  I would recommend getting into a smaller group, like 2-3 people.  Take him if you enjoy learning.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2010<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unstructured, hard to follow, and the tests are really tough!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2010<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would never take him again.

But you learn- isn't this what college is all about. Midterm, final, and a group paper. Buy the book and read it, use the online study- the midterm and final have multiple choice from the book. Take as much notes as you can because you'll need it to study from.  Extremely knowlidgeable professor. It was a pleasure sitting through his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2009<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible!his lectures are all over the place, with no clear structure or order.tests are ridiculously long and hard.he certainly knows his subject but his teaching methods and grading policy are terrible.don't waste your time and money and don't ruin your gpa.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2009<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He tells you to not buy the text, but you have attend his lectures or get notes b/c his exams are based solely on lectures.  Really easy mult choice, but tough on essay Q's. Group research paper...tough grader.  One of the best economists at DePaul.  He works at the Chicago Fed. Take him if you want to really learn something.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2008<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DONT EVEN THINK OF TAKING A CLASS WITH HIM !!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/09/2008<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid him if you can.  No instractions at all. No use of textbook. Nobody knows what to study for his mid or final. + he is tough grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2008<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not purchase the book.  He will say you will use it but he has no idea where what he is teaching matches up with the book (chapters on syllabus do not match material).  Exams are not that difficult but the paper can be somewhat lengthy depending on your topic.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2008<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Midterm, Final and group research paper....Textbook is useless, there's nothing in his exams that are from text. He explains everything quantitatively, and hard to understand the theory and concepts the way he presents it. Don't do group paper with more than 3 people. Exams are half objective, half essay. He's tough on essay.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/31/2006<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Test are difficult!

NO HW Straight Lecture. His lecture is very very very confusing and I could never read what he wrote (he wrote on the dry erase board)The tests were pretty challenging because his wording makes no sense. There is a huge curve.  ended up surprisingly with a B</div></div></div></body></html>
