It was her first time teaching 101 so I tried to cut her some slack but she was just okay. I think she will get better with time. But she is willing to meet with you any time!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>She's repetitive. "Easy" class if you read the ENTIRE 40pg/class articles-Expects you to know small details. Doesn't get to the point until the last 10mins of class. Picks on certain people. The course itself is okay, but her sources are not reliable. Participation points. Course was about race&ethnicity but she added sociology and literature.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awful class.

This class required a lot of reading, writing, and class participation (including online discussion postings), but we did learn a lot about Race & Ethnicity. Class was demanding at times with a large load of work but course objectives were met.</div></div></div></body></html>
