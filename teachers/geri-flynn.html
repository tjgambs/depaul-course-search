Prof. Flynn use to be a counselor and it shows. I loved this class and her. The quizzes/tests were right from the books - you have to read. They were easy too. Final ended up being two small paper assignments instead of a test.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2012<br>Class Name: REL220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Religion and Psychology, seems weird but it was actually extremely interesting. Not super religion based. Take this for liberal studies requirement. She's hands down the nicest most caring professor I've had. Lots of reading -> lots of in class discussions. Exams are kinda hard. Learned a lot of applicable life skills, took a step towards wisdom.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2012<br>Class Name: REL220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Flynn is so passionate about this class that it makes it great. The reading in the first half of the quarter is kind of boring but the discussions are good and the papers are easy. She tells a lot of stories for her own life. This class is really interesting</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2012<br>Class Name: REL220<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's super sweet and understanding. Basically the whole class you just talk about your personal experinces and feelings, so it's not a boring lecture.Although she isn't very clear about the reflections. I usually write good papers and she said mine needed more clarity. She also doesn't respond to emails, atleast when I tried once.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2010<br>Class Name: REL220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Textbook: 1 (Need to read whole thing for course). Grade is highly depended on participation so prepare to speak up. It's an easy A if you know what you're talking about and if you want to understand more about Religion and Psychology. Overall, 8.5/10.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/29/2010<br>Class Name: REL220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Flynn is genuinely interested in the subject she teaches, which makes the class that much more enjoyable to be in.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2009<br>Class Name: REL225<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is easy. Minimal material to learn, don't need book, but must attend class. Be sure to get to know her well personally because she finds her favorites on day one. She is also very optimistic, so when participating make sure it is &quot;something she would like to hear&quot; or agree with. Not a very fair grader, but pretty simple class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2008<br>Class Name: REL225<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Flynn is such a nice lady. She always stimulated class discussions, and chose very good films to show in class. Take this course, easy A, and quite fun if you like movies!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2008<br>Class Name: REL220<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Was in class everyday. Got A's in everything. Participated but not everyday. Ended up with a 0/10% for particiapation. So basically if you don't participate every single day more than once, you will get 0. Trust me theres not inbetween. She sucks with the participation thing. Really unfair grader!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2008<br>Class Name: REL220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Material is not hard if you read. Papers are easy. She is vey big on partiicaption. It's 10% of your grade so if you are not actively involved in the discussions you will get a grade LOWER than what you deserve. so be prepared to participate. Over all not bad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2008<br>Class Name: REL225<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. Very easy A. The 2 tests are easy, otherwise you write 5 film critiques and watch a movie every class. She's a very sweet lady and the class and the discussions are not very religious.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2008<br>Class Name: REL220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is really easy. Attendance is mandatory only allows two absences. Make sure you do the readings there pretty short. 2 really easy tests, one 4 page informal paper, and a final exam.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2008<br>Class Name: REL225<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A great teacher.

Before taking the class I was sort of dreading the religion part of it, but she really made it pretty interesting, and it was not hard to do well.  Definitely take her if you have the chance!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2007<br>Class Name: REL220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really wasnt looking forward to this class, but it ended up being awesome. She is so sweet and understanding. It is pretty easy class and it was actually pretty interesting. There is a lot of class discussion, so if you're not into sharing parts of your life dont take it, but if you are this class is great. Love her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2007<br>Class Name: REL220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this class was very interesting not to mention very easy. she explains the work really well and keeps it simple but at the same time you learn a lot. the exams and assignments are not too hard. you dont need to be a psych major to get an A. discussions are fun and educational and she even gave us a take hm final. recommend her to everyone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2007<br>Class Name: REL220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She does act like a therapist. However, if you pay attention in class you will do well. Tests are easy in my opinion, just study the note sheets. Ok class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2007<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is a very nice lady who encourages participation. She talks to her students as apposed to at. She belives that it's important not to just lecture students but to allow them to speak as well. Not much homework in the class but some readings. the tests were okay.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/14/2007<br>Class Name: REL220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was SO BORING and useless that staying home and sleeping would be more educating. The woman is supposed to a porfessor, NOT a therapist, but she tries to act like one. BORING, USELESS, DEPRESSING, WASTE OF TIME CLASS!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/14/2007<br>Class Name: REL220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible teacher, talks about depressing things in life (death, sorrow, greef). I did not learn anything. Talk about wasting time. This is the class! The teacher just talks about what she believes in.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2006<br>Class Name: REL220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really great teacher.  A lot of reading but it is not necessary, you just have to study the handouts and take notes during class. Participation is big in this class - if you do participate she will do anything she can to help you.  I would definetly recommend taking her, she's great</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2006<br>Class Name: PSYCHANDRELIG<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Flynn was an amazing woman.  She always gave personal anecdotes to help the class understand concepts.  Sort of a lot of reading, but not neccessarily needed to pass the course.  Listen in class and take notes and you should be fine. She gave 3 or 4 tests throughout and the final was NOT cumulative!  Take this class--you won't regret it!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: REL220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is a great teacher and also nice lady. it's ture that there are tons of readings for this class but I pretty enjoyed this class. you will not regret this class if you do your things.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2006<br>Class Name: REL220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>boring boring BORING. if i wanted to talk about my feelings, i would have found a therapist. beginning of the quarter, it was all &quot;history of psychologists&quot; and then the second half of the quarter, grief and feelings. you take 3 tests, which are easy, and then final is a take-home. but seriously, i have never EVER been this bored in a class before.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/01/2006<br>Class Name: REL220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>so unhelpful, class is super boring and i dont like her teaching stlye...she was rude and not easy 2 approach...dont take her!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2005<br>Class Name: REL220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i asked her 4 studying tips and she said well just participate more in class! she didnt give me any helpful study tips..she's one of the worst teachers I have come across at DePaul.

She gives clear instruction and notes--you have to study for the tests which are short answer/essay, but as long as you take the time you will do very well. Flashcards are really helpful for this course for memorization. Fairly interesting material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2005<br>Class Name: PSYCHANDREL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgeable.
