She is one of the nicest professors I have had at DePaul and really cares about her students. Assignments are somewhat difficult in how we are to analyze several poems and compile a journal. Sometimes we were to write an original poem in 5 minutes and share with the class. Good class, I definitely learned something new.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2010<br>Class Name: LST309<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great instructor!

I took it because EXP learning requisite, but I really, and I mean really enjoyed the class.
