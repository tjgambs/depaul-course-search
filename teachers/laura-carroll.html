She was also a rather harsh grader. Often, I did not understand why points been deducted. I don't feel I benefited in any way from taking this class. Overall, it was a horrible experience and a complete waste of my time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2011<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>&quot;Laura&quot; told us this was her first college class, and we could tell.  She was INCREDIBLY nervous, and was very unclear.  While I felt for her, do not take the class.  She really doesn't teach much of anything - but grades tough.</div></div></div></body></html>
