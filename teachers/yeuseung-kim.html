The material isn't hard, there's just a lot of it. Prof. Kim is very clear about the material and has in class exercises to understand the material. One midterm, one final, and a final group project making a media plan. I learned a lot in this class and didn't mind the work. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2015<br>Class Name: 244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Kim is fantastic. She knows a lot about the advertising world. I definitely recommend her class for both PRAD majors and non-majors. She isn't easy but the class is not hard. She is very clear in what she expects of you and how to get the best possible grade. She does want you to come to class, gives some pop quizzes, and is very helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2014<br>Class Name: PRAD379<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome!! So helpful for PRAD majors. clear powerpoints in class, minimal hw that is collected twice; once at midterms, then at final. 2 exams, and one big group project. Easy but also really interesting/relatable for PRAD major. Take take take!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/25/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD379<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is the reason I got a job directly out of college. Media Planning for the win. SO helpful. Yes  have to work hard, but what you learn actually helps in the real world.
