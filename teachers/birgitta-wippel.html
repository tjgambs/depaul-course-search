I would never take a class from her again and she really made me reconsider my major.

She is a rookie, her test are hard and she totally sneaks things in on the test.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2004<br>Class Name: ORGCOMM<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2004<br>Class Name: COM<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She&#8217;s really annoying.  She actually brought a whistle to class in an attempt to control us. Everything is on PowerPoint so pretty much anyone could teach this stuff.  I&#8217;m not a Com. major but if I were I&#8217;d think about changing my concentration.  Try to avoid this nut job.

HAS TO LEARN HOW TO MAKE SUBJECT MATTER FUN. She can become dry and force the class to drag. Also has trouble controlling the class, embarass a few students and that will stop.

Because of Wippel, I am no longer minoring in Communications. Everything she does irritates me...unclear, unsure of herself, class is monotonous & a joke, and I've honestly learned nada.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2004<br>Class Name: CMNTHEORY<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>weird one.  good intention of teaching btu doent go through</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2004<br>Class Name: CMN360<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is boring, and she uses way too many overheads. Papers are a waste of time - her expectations are unclear, and she grades you down for that. Brought too much of her personal life into class. But, she is nice, and generally fairly accessible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2004<br>Class Name: COM361<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I couldn't stand her.  Her tests were ridiculous and the papers were a big waste of time.  She should actually test on what she teaches over and over and over again during her lectures.  And I hated hearing about her kid.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2004<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree that her accent is very annoying, and she teaches public speaking, as if she is the one giving a speech.  we go over the same things shes taught everyday.  I learned more in high school, and the class is a waste of time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2004<br>Class Name: 251<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you see wippell's name on the list, you must no matter how much her time fits in your schedule AVOID it.  She is not sexy and her accent is totally annoying.  Her test are not from the book or lectures.  In fact not sure how where they come from.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2004<br>Class Name: CMN<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not the greatest teacher and isn't very clear.  On the other hand she is very sexy.  A nice body and a slight, super sexy Swedish accent.</div></div></div></body></html>
