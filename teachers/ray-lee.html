If you do everything he says, you will learn a lot and get a good grade.  If you don't... you will probably hate him.  He's the most challenging design professor at DePaul in the best possible way.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2009<br>Class Name: ART228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ray Lee is awesome!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2008<br>Class Name: ART227<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ray is really boring, but his assignments are meaningful and I  learned a lot. He really wants to give his students a feel for becoming a professional graphic designer.  I would def recommend taking him.  Just do all your work and apply yourself and you'll get a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/12/2008<br>Class Name: ART228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As always, I love Ray's classes!  If he likes you, you are a tad bit better off, but its not hard to get on his good side!  Don't take anything he says or does too seriously.  This class was great and I learned a lot!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2008<br>Class Name: ART101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>good designer, extremely awful teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/22/2008<br>Class Name: DIG220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WORST TEACHER AT DEPAUL! I have never been so let down my any professor. He expects everyone to be a professional graphic designer and he gives no constructive criticism...he could careless about his students. No Exceptions, it is his way or an F...Who takes off awhole letter grade for not stapling there paper!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/26/2007<br>Class Name: ARTSECT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is by far the best design professor I've ever had.  He assigns what seems to be a lot of work, but the end result is worth the workload and I've learned so much from each assignment.  If you make the effort to keep up with the workload, show up to class and actually participate, you'll do well with him and respect him as a professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2007<br>Class Name: ART104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Lee is awkward as others have said.  When I asked him for help on a drawing he did embarass me in class and it was unnecessary But, he is pretty leniant as long as you are respectful and sensible.  I got an A.  So take him if you're willling to be responsible and attend all classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2007<br>Class Name: ART227<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Aside from his complete awkwardness in any social situation...Ray pushes students to do their best but doesn't always do it a very subtle way.  While he is degrading, I can say that I definetly grew as a designer because he is so picky and hard on students.  Just do what he wants on the projects and you'll be fine</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2007<br>Class Name: ART201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOME Teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2006<br>Class Name: ART201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ray was understanding and very open about your own ideas, and helpful in sparking ideas. He is critical in critques but honest overall. Most importantly he was fair.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2006<br>Class Name: ART<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Most horrendous teacher ever! Ray Lee has no place on a college campus. He is rude, unhelpful and completely lacking any qualifications to teach. Never, ever, under any circumstances, should you even consider taking a class by Ray Lee. The only thing I learned from him is how to be insulted.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2006<br>Class Name: ART227<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unless you enjoy being insulted and degraded, do NOT take this person under any circumstances.  He has one of the most foul personalities and takes out his own misery on his students.  I have no idea how this completely unqualified man got a job at DePaul.  He should not be allowed anywhere near a classroom and should be in the unemployment line.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2006<br>Class Name: ELECTRONICTB<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honeslty one of the worst teachers I've ever had.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2006<br>Class Name: ART227<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WORST TEACHER EVER! all i have to say is don't take him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2005<br>Class Name: ART<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE A CLASS FROM THIS GUY!!!  He has the worst personality on planet Earth and he is completely rude and irrational.  He picks and chooses who he likes and if he doesn't like you then you are screwed.  He bites.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2005<br>Class Name: CREATINGART10<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2005<br>Class Name: ARTDESIGN<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you have the option of taking someone elses class I would do so, that is if you want to be stressed out of your mind....Ray is nice to you if you get on his good side, but otherwise....watch out.  He overloads the homework and then emails you even more after that, so if you don't check your email you're screwed!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2005<br>Class Name: ART101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ray is the best teacher I've had in the art and art history department. He defintiely doesn't take any crap from students, but he is very helpful and is always in his office, so he is easy to talk to. He works as a professor and a freelance designer, so his input is very helpful. His demonstrations are very clear.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2005<br>Class Name: ART101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT! I repeat...DO NOT take a class with this unqualified and unreasonable teacher. His insipid personality only adds to his dull and frustrating teaching methods. Instead of utilizing a student's struggle as a positive challenge, he simply laughs at the student's frustration and offers NO aid. Avoid Ray Lee like the plague!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2005<br>Class Name: ART101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ray is very irrational and loves to give poor grades... he is unhelpful, unreasonable and inconsiderate... keep away from his class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2005<br>Class Name: TYPOGRAPHY<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>whoever gave ray a chili pepper is out of his/her mind. he's unattractive AND hard to work with.

Sometimes he goes a little fast, but just make sure to ask questions and you will be fine. He is a really good teacher and is reasonable. I learned alot from him, just do what he does on the excercises to get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2005<br>Class Name: ART101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ray doesn't take much **** from students. He started out relatively easy, but at times he seemed very bored and uninterested in teaching (perhaps it was the 8:30 a.m. class&#63;) If you follow his instructions, and ask questions (which he really encourages) - do your assignments and you'll be fine.</div></div></div></body></html>
