I think it is more work than the classroom, though. There are lots of assignments but you can work ahead on most of them. Don't take if you don't like online group projects. The textbook is expensive and boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/08/2010<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Completed Christina's course online.  Learning take-aways were few.  Professor was generally unresponsive to requests for interaction.  I know she receives high marks for her classroom sessions, but I was unimpressed with her online course.  Class featured no quizzes or tests. Avoid the course if you are serious about increasing your knowledge.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/06/2010<br>Class Name: MIS674<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was much more challenging then MIS 555 as it went further into system design and implementation. Dr. Outlay presented the material very well and made her expectations crystal clear from day one.  I would definitely recommend this course and professor as it was extremely useful for real world applications.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2010<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am just finishing my MBA, it makes me wish I went with an MSF instead. No quality add, online format should be for convenience, when in reality you are made to participate nearly daily on a inferior blackboard format with sub pare and poorly recorded presentations and assignments requiring pricey,text. Teacher is good, content is lacking.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2010<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Outlay is the best of the MIS professors. She is very nice. She does give quizzes but they are not timed, but still completely useless. There are three papers due (two of which are 3-4 single spaced pages). There is a group presentation at the end. No final, no final exam class in Week 11. MIS is still useless, but she is a very good teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2010<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Outlay=Outstanding professor. Relevant knowledge to the business world.Helpful and accessible.Weekly quizzes,3 projects and 1 team project. Highly recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2010<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr Outlay definitely knows her stuff.  She is really interested in making sure you learn and retain concepts from class.  I would definitely take her for MIS again.  You have weekly quizzes, weekly case studies to discuss, a few papers and one group project.  She is very nice and always willing to help in any way she can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2009<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Christina Outlay is an asset to DePaul. What a wonderful, thorough, very knowledgeable instructor. MIS555 is definitely her forte. Lots of reading, short untimed quizzes, no mid/final. Syllabus is crystal clear and precise. Learned a lot!!! Take her class you will not regret it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2009<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OMG Dr. Outlay's class is a LOT of work, but it was way more beneficial than I expected. Her (high) expectations are explicitly stated but Dr. Outlay is down to earth and explains things in a matter anyone can understand. It's worth taking her class. It's not easy but if you do all the work you'll get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2009<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class online and would recommend this format.  Class &quot;participation&quot; involved simple postings to Blackboard; so long as you DO them you'll do fine in the class.  Very easy, but not very engaging or interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2009<br>Class Name: MIS674<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The instructor at least for this class was useless. Assignments were do on Sunday's but instructor was never available from Friday afternoon until Tuesday. Her assignments were unclear. This was an online class and she did not post any new lectures after week 5. Most of her postings a total of 4 for an 11 week class was done from UTUBE videos.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2009<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Outlay is very knowledgeable and a great teacher.  You?ll get a good overview of the IT world through this class.  Weekly quizzes, but they are online and if you?re familiar with the subject matter you will do fine.  Overall, a very enjoyable class and a pleasant professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2008<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would absolutely recommend Dr. Outlay for MIS 555.  Don't be frightened that 40% of your grade is participation!  As long as you go to class and show some interest you will get full credit for this.  No midterm or final exam!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2008<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Material is a bit dry, but she encourages discussion.  Only con - group paper/presentation, but if you have a good group, then it's not a problem.  No exams, but a lot of busy work.  Quizes aren't timed!  Worth taking her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2008<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very explicit expectations for this class; if you do the work, you will get a good grade.  Dr. Outlay is fair, but will give you tough questions during your presentation.  Book is not so great, but case studies were very interesting.  Dr. Outlay is highly recommended for MIS 555,</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2008<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best MIS 555 professor by far.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/23/2008<br>Class Name: IS511<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed this class. It was a lot of reading and in class discussion. If I had the chance I would definitely take her again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2008<br>Class Name: IM210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Christina is wonderful!  She is very intelligent and definitely has a passion for teaching.  She is also very personable and very understanding.  Definitely would recommend taking her for this course and any other one she may be teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2007<br>Class Name: MIS000<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is definitly one of the most impressive Profs I've had at DePaul. Definitly knows the topics well.. explains concepts clearly, down to earth but wants everyone to learn.... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2007<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was very organized with expectations clear and concise.  She is a very good professor and explains things with clarity.  She is explains things well also.  I would take her for another course in a heartbeat.  The book is useless and she assigns a lot of reading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/04/2007<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of readings, every week a short timed quiz, case study.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2007<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is very well organized, the syllabus and expectations 100% clear. Usually quizzes weekly, a group presentation for final. Lots of in class debate, but very dry material. Main time consumption is in the weekly reading, but otherwise not difficult. Outlay makes it as fun as possible. Take her!</div></div></div></body></html>
