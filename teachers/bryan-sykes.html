Daily attendance is mandatory. Assignments can be difficult and even confusing. However, Professor Sykes is always willing to help, if you truly want to learn. Take advantage of his office hours!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2012<br>Class Name: SOC305<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Sykes is incredibly intelligent, and well spoken. His class was hard, and I found his midterm to be TOO hard. His powerpoint lectures get boring, and he includes too much info on slides. Be prepared to work hard, and do a great research paper. He is a nice guy and does offer extra credit.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2012<br>Class Name: SOC220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful and an excellent professor.

He's great! He is so supportive and encouraging. Very helpful and willing to extend himself for the students. The final was not that hard despite being &quot;cumulative&quot;. The group presentation was not that hard either. As long as you go to class, pay attention, and keep up with the material, you will be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2011<br>Class Name: SOC220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was not what I expected. I expected to learn about theories of Crime, instead we were presented with statics with very limited exposure to any theories. One group project(easy), 10 page research paper, and Final based on Everything! He's new to DePaul's QTR and fell behind and now trying to rush us thru toward the end.</div></div></div></body></html>
