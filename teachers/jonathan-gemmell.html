He is one of the few professors at DePaul that actually make you want to attend his lectures.

Homework, quizzes, and tests are easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2008<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
