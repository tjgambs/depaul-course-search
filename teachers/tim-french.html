If you don't read the text book be prepared to fail because the class is a discussion based class.  I recommend this class if you are a chemistry major. If you are a biology major i would not recommend this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/14/2015<br>Class Name: CHE140<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is hard. French had amazing lectures though, but the tests were very difficult. Definitely go to his office hours and work with him through the problems. He's a super cool guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2015<br>Class Name: CHE132134<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Tough grader, but lectures are informative</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2014<br>Class Name: CHEM130131<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: WD</div><div id="right"><div>Took him for both my chem 130 and 131; chem130- lectures are interesting, but the homework assignments are nothing like what he lectures aboout chem 131: hard grader and his TA isnt helpful at all you have to kiss butt to get answers and he wont let you leave til youve solved all calculations. dropped the class after failing in both things</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2014<br>Class Name: 135<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's the best chemistry professor at this school.  I found this class to be very difficult but I went to all the classes, SI sessions, read the chapters, and did all the HW. Lots of work but I ended up with a good grade. Anyone that gave him a bad grade didnt work for it enough and thats not a reflection on him. He is helpful and really funny. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/31/2014<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>French is easily my least favorite professor I have ever had. The assignments were repetitive and tedious, and they did not properly prepare you for the exams he gave. He is an extremely harsh grader, using it to assert his superiority rather than to teach and assist learning. I would not recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2014<br>Class Name: CHEM131<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do NOT take his class. He is a harsh grader and thinks he is better than everybody else. I would say he is one of the worst teachers I have ever had.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2014<br>Class Name: CHE131<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, however a really harsh grader.  He explains everything and as long as you study and take notes then you should be fine!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2014<br>Class Name: CHE134<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DON'T TAKE!!!I'm not one to complain about a prof but holy crap WHAT A JOKE.I never studied so much for a class and have ended up not passing. My class was taught by a diff prof and then was thrown in w his after 3 weeks. He acknowledged us being behind and gave us an exam anyway. Him nor the dept do not care that most of the class was failing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2013<br>Class Name: CHE135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>THE WORST TEACHER I HAVE EVER HAD. Please avoid at all costs if you value your GPA. His exams/labs are graded harshly and the department does not care if the class is failing, or that half have dropped. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2013<br>Class Name: 135101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Over half the class has dropped, and or failing. The department seems to not care that us failing is a reflection on the teacher not us. He is the harshest grader and his lectures/homework are not helpful. It wouldn't kill him to use a power point either instead of scribbling all over the board, so we can't read the notes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2013<br>Class Name: 134102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far the worst teacher I've Everglades for a general chemistry class. His exams are all like final exams he doesn't curve he doesn't give extra credit he's very arrogant doesn't care that students fail his class. If you have other options avoid him at all cost.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/03/2013<br>Class Name: CHE131<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely difficult class. Harsh grader, he's funny in class & overall a nice guy, but in general, wouldn't suggest him if you have any other options. He came to DePaul from Harvard and still teaches as such...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2013<br>Class Name: CHEM132<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>absolutely sucks as a teacher. Wouldnt reccommend anyone to take him. Way to mean, way to harsh at grading, and way to ignorant. Thinks he's better than everyone and way too much sassiness. He takes off points for every little thing, doesnt encourage students at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2013<br>Class Name: CHE132<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE HIM IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO. He is a VERY harsh grader. Gives little to no partial credit, and takes off alot of points for small mistakes. He may be available outside of class but is very intimidating. At least half of the class dropped by the end of the term. Has no passion for the subject.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2013<br>Class Name: CHE100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Difficult teacher, not too helpful even when I emailed him asking for help with homework. Harsh grader. Son, just don't.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2013<br>Class Name: 133110<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class difficulty isn't too bad but he is harsh when it comes to grades.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2012<br>Class Name: CHE131<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an awesome professor. He takes the time to make sure students understand material and is always available outside of class. I had no prior experience in chemistry and the class was extremely challenging but if you go to class, do homework, and study it is doable. He is a harsh grader, but other than that hes great!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2012<br>Class Name: CHE100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I always do very well in all of my classes-except this one.  Everyone in our "100 level class" was failing and many dropped. He can be very sassy. He is a visiting professor from Harvard and can't teach to save his life. Harsh grader, moves fast, difficulty understanding you are new to the info, does not care if you fail.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2012<br>Class Name: CHE100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is friendly and is available outside of class for extra help.  He assigns homework every week, has three exams and a final.  If you study, you should do well!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2012<br>Class Name: CHEM100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Intro level class where the knowledge of chemistry is not required. Dr. French failed at keeping this in mind and assumed that we had prior knowledge. Test grades are very low in his class. I found this class very difficult and I was in higher level sciences including chemistry prior to taking this class. I do not recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2012<br>Class Name: CHE131<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take him for chem lab! He is a very harsh grader, and does not make his expectations clear. He is very sassy. The comments he leaves in lab reports are rude and uncalled for. Do not recommend.</div></div></div></body></html>
