I originally hated this kind of stuff, but he made it so interesting. He's very intelligent, GREAT lecturer, VERY neat,and wants you to get it.... I can't say enough about how great of a teacher he is. Take home mid-term and final (ea. 40% of grade), 20% is part. so speak up! I recommend him to EVERYONE.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2008<br>Class Name: PSC150<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor; a little boring, but I think it was more the material than him.  Class is very structured, and while attendance is not really mandatory, being in class and taking notes will help you tremendously!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2008<br>Class Name: PSC340<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is my second class with this professor. That alone should tell you something. He's a fair grader and has a dry sense of humor-typical of poli sci professors. I would continue to take classes with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2008<br>Class Name: PSC340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had 2 classes with him. Very intelligent professor with a very sweet disposition. Fair grader. Attend lecture and take notes (he gives great notes) and you'll do fine. Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2007<br>Class Name: PSC242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>PSC242 is an awesome class by a very intelligen professor. It is definitely one of the best classes I have taken at DePaul. Give him a raise!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2007<br>Class Name: PSC242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Second class with this guy. Covered history, theory and contemporary issues of US foreign policy. Very informative. Learned tons. Fair grader. Highly recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2007<br>Class Name: PSC242<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very smart and intelligent.  However, he has a horrible way of teaching.  All he does it stand at the board, write notes, and lecture.  As a night class, it was painful.  DO NOT TAKE!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2007<br>Class Name: PSC242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Joo used to be a contract killer in Hong Kong before he became a professor at DePaul. I one time saw him slice up a student who insulted his honor. He cut the kid from nose to nuts with a playing card (I think it was the Queen of Spades). I coughed one time in class and I was forced to be forgiveness on my knees. He's a very hard man.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/02/2007<br>Class Name: PSC150<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>a very BORING lecturer but you do gain a lot of detail on political thought. No text but there are weekly readings that seem optional (You will need to know them for the take-home midterm and final, your only grades in the class) Go to class and speak up during the few discussions, it can change your grade!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2007<br>Class Name: PSC344<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't be intimidated at the first class.  This course is very relaxing.  Especially night classes.  There are two papers for the midterm and final.  He does take attendance.  However, no one ever came to most class sessions.  Easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2007<br>Class Name: PSC342<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My favorite professor.  Extremely knowledgable, and has a clever and very dry sense of humor.  Ask him about anything, and he can talk about in detail for hours.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2006<br>Class Name: PSC150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the first few weeks are extremely boring but dont drop out of the class because of that! this class gives you a great overview of theories of political thought. he really knows what he is talking about, is very kind, and answers questions well. if you take notes and dont do the reading you will get a B. if you actually read too you will get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/18/2006<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As long as you pay attention in class, you'll be fine. Also, the more you participate, the more he'll remember you- which is a plus for your participation grade. A lot of readings, but all you have to do is skim through it because he explains everything in class. Both a take-home midterm and final. Great, can be both funny and serious prof. TAKE HI</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2006<br>Class Name: PSC253<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really cool guy. Funny in his own way. Really in depth notes that help come mid-term and finals. Not too demanding, but get ready for an intense cram for the paper(s), other than that, really not too bad. Class can get slow sometimes, but it happens in all classes. Take him, he's cool.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2006<br>Class Name: PSC150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very good professor. is very smart. class is interesting. there are good readings, and he is an easy grader.  makes it really easy to speak up in class and voice opinions</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2006<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very interesting</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2006<br>Class Name: PSC253<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Goes over all the readings so you dont have to</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2006<br>Class Name: PSC150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2006<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am taking his HON201 and it is very interesting!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2006<br>Class Name: PSC150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely, one of the best courses at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2006<br>Class Name: PSC150<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably the worst professor I've ever had. Some reasons for this are I feel he was not very clear, very aloof, discourages most discussion, and, at least when I took the class, he knew maybe two or three students names by the time it had ended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2006<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked the first half of the course where we analyzed Adam Smith, Karl Marx and Karl Polanyi. It was very interesting and informative. On a negative note, readings were heavy and dense. So, if you are not REALLY committed, do not take this course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2006<br>Class Name: PSC150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know about other courses but his PSC 150 was GREAT!  I learned tons.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2006<br>Class Name: ASIANPOLITICS<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2006<br>Class Name: PSC150<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought this professor was soooooo boring! I wanted to just stick a needle in my eye through every class. He has a heavy accent, which you will not understand that much, and he isn't very clear on some things. Try to avoid this professor at all costs!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2006<br>Class Name: PSC253<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Like the other reviewers say, Professor Joo conducts his classes as 100% lecture. Personally I find that really boring and not very helpful. He frequently leaves out important facts and creates the impression he does not have a firm grasp on the material. I guess some people like his teaching style, but it's so boring I can't even pay attention...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2006<br>Class Name: PSC150<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was nice enough. I got an A- without really reading the assigned material, but instead just attending class and taking notes. He never takes attendance, but unless you want to read, I'd recommend going.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2005<br>Class Name: PSC150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Joo is very organized and clear with his lectures.  Each class is 100% lecture.  His accent and handwriting can be a hard to understand at times, but he speaks slowly.  There is a ton of material to learn and so much reading, it can be overwhelming.  There are only 2 papers for the class, which is good and bad.  He is fair in his grading.</div></div></div></body></html>
