He is not friendly or funny in a way that I appreciated. Overall I just found him very frustrating. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Markwell was very unclear about most of the assignments and was unclear about what his expectations of us were</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really enjoyed Markwell's class.

Fair grader. Doesn't assign busy work. Can be a bit snarky at times but I would recommend him for WRD 103 and WRD 104.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Markwell is very passionate about what he teaches. He is always eager to help his students, but he is not afraid to be critical of poor work. He likes people who speak up in class. I would recommend him highly for someone who likes English and writing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is funny, but he's really rude and dry, so you have to be able to handle his personality. He'll call you out for every wrong thing you say, and challenge every argument. Doesn't hand out As; you must work hard for them. Very arrogant and full of himself, but he's not sensitive so you can voice your emotions. Didn't LOVE him, but he wasn't awful</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/03/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Quite possibly the very worst class I've taken at DePaul.  The instructor is very arrogant and rude.  For example, this session the entire class was seniors and day one he said (a direct quote) "Your all seniors so I can pretty much assign whatever I want and you have to do it since you can't afford to fail or retake this class".  Don't take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor I have had so far. Attendance is mandatory (that includes lateness). Reading quizzes are awful. He isn't very helpful and doesn't reply to emails. Obnoxious and kind of rude. I'm an A student but this class was dreadful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Scott is a cool person to talk to, he has no reservations on what he'll say. Homework: not hard but you must earn your grade. He also doesnt give out alot. The only real pain is the reading quizzes, which were my bane of the class. Basically: not a class you can BS but if you try even slightly you'll do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoy having Professor Markwell. He's really good at forming interesting discussions in class and makes it less boring. He's not the easiest grader, but he's also not extremely difficult either. Overall I enjoyed his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2012<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Markwell is an awesome professor. He is definitely not an easy, and makes you work hard for an A, but if you put in actual effort you will do well. He is very sarcastic, and isn't shy about his political beliefs but I loved that. It made the class much more interesting. Come to class ready to work and you'll be fine. AND DON'T BE LATE.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm a transfer student that had to take WRD 103 as a junior. I figured the class would be easy, and it was, but I fear for the freshman who come into this class and have to deal with an ill-prepared professor. He often loosely described the assignments in class and you could only guess what he would actually grade them on. Doesn't use D2L.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2011<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a good teacher, but I found him extraordinarily arrogant. He was always talking about the generation he teaches being the least literate and how incredibly inept he thought we were. He generalized everyone to fit his notion of young people. He needs to find a new profession if he hates younger generations, frankly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2011<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Markwell is great. Don't listen to anyone telling you otherwise. He actually makes you work for yourself and won't spoon feed you. Plus, he's freakin HILARIOUS! Take him if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2011<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is such an ass, he makes it a big deal if you email him and ask for help. He never answers your question directly, and makes everything confusing. Overall he just is not helpful at all</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Markwell is great! The comments here don't do him justice. He knows what he's talking about and plus he's HILARIOUS! I would definetly take him again. The textbook we used was Exploring Languages. So don't bother buying the others until WRD 104.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's really full of himself and rude. From talking to others who had different professors, Markwell made us do more work than what they had to do. However, he actually kind of knows what he's talking about compared to some other wrd professors</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Markwell is overall a really helpful professor and will answer any question you have. He is always willing to set up a meeting and is clear when explaining things. He expects a lot out of you but I feel that after discussing other WRD classes with friends, you will take the most out of his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The man knows rhetoric and will pound it into you. His class was challenging, I carried a ton away from it. Take this class if you actually want to learn from WRD 104. Don't take it if you can't handle being the butt of a joke, hard work and a smart professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The dry humor cracks me up, although some peopled don't get it sometimes. He is a good teacher, but you need to ask questions or else he will keep going.  He knows what he is doing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There are lots of sections of this class. I highly recommend avoiding Markwell. You will dread going to class and hearing him use the fact that you are a captive audience to be his soundboard for lame jokes and male chauvinist remarks. I should have followed the instinct to drop him after the first class session.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is a distinct line between sarcasm and being condescending and obnoxious. Professor Markwell crosses that line on a fairly regular basis. If you enjoy learning concepts of argument that you should have been taught in middle and high school, then by all means take this class. Since I was transferring, I dropped this class. You should too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/22/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I completed all the assignments, tried to get feedback to improve my work (Markwell is vague and inarticulate), attended most classes, and walked out with a B+, having learned very little. I felt that the class was a waste of time and Markwell's lectures and tangents mostly just revolved around his desperation for approval.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome dude, just a tough class. Don't expect to get a good grade in the class either, because he doesn't seem to grade higher than a b+. Still a really cool guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take Markwell. I am an A student and despite meeting with him to discuss how to improve my work, I only pulled off a B+ in his class. He was no help when I met with him. He is arrogant and is clearly teaching freshman to feel cool & they don't question him or point out his many flaws. I'm confused that he was rated hot...he's not at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/23/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great professor! runs a fun class and some of the assignments are enjoyable. will help you with papers and responds to e-mails very quickly. not afraid to speak his mind. very blunt but if you put the effort into the class, it will pay off.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of people think that he's really outrageous, but I think that's only if you're used to conservative teaching. You write solely on one topic a year, it gets a little redundant but it's helpful to learn different forms of persuasion. Semi-difficult grader, I tried my best for an A but I got a B+ instead.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2008<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a fantastic professor. Take it from someone whose first language is not English. I am not a strong writer either and he went out of his way to help me. He's funny and compared to other professors his assignments are not as long or as many. If you're not into sarcasm then do not take him. He kept me awake after coming from Eco and religion.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is really good.  i hated him the first couple of weeks, but he grew on me.  he cares a lot about you learning.  he does pick favorites, but he does this based on who will talk in class.  AND, if he makes fun of you, just make fun of him back, he appreciates it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/03/2007<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very funny man. His jokes are very riskee. He made me laugh while learning ENGLISH! He was well informed and he is entertaning while he teaches.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Smart/funny teacher, he can be demanding at times but you will leave his class knowing your****. I worked for an A, but got a B+, still his grading is fair.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is flipping amazing. You actually LEARN in this class and improve your writing skills. Its not a blow off class and its not impossible. Just make sure you invest time into your papers and it will be awesome. Hes very helpful and is willing to take the time to talk with you. I took him twice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/13/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Go to class everyday and do NOT get on his bad side!  He picks favorites and is a wannabe actor who thinks his bad jokes amuse the class.  Not an easy grader and grades with his moods.  Made a rude comment to me about smelling like cigs.  A**hole</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2006<br>Class Name: EN104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's good ! at first, he may looks a lil bit scary with his course material.. but his jokes really made a difference(although sometime it's a lil bit too much) and very2 helpful outside / inside the classroom.. I reccomend u to take his class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2006<br>Class Name: ENG<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very very obnoxious... kinda picks favorites...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are laid back and have a good sense of humor you will like him, but if you are uptight and get offended easily you probably aren't going to like Markwell.  I thought he was funny as hell and made class interesting.  However, he is not an easy grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a somewhat obnoxious indivdual that can be humorous as well. Participation is major here so it is very important that you show up to class everyday. Do not except anything easy here...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Is a decent teacher i guess...

The man is not arrogant, he does not have an agenda, he is not insulting, and he is damn good at his job, which is to TEACH RHETORIC.  It is not to help you have a nice GPA, you have to do that on your own.  The man is fair.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is great. The assignments were compelling and the papers were pretty hard. If you do the work, participate in class, and put lots the time into the papers, you will have no problems in this class. His lectures in class are very broad. He doesn't spoon-feed you concepts, nor does he hold your hand through the course. Fun guy. Good class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2005<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree with the guy who said that anyone who liked this man is faking it.  I was in his course last year; he spat out stupid jokes, gave overwhelming assignments, had a HUGE ego, was very unhelpful and generally viewed that whatever he said was gold and the rest was rubbish.  He stated that he had his cell phone on &quot;only for my agent.&quot;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A good guy, down to earth, but always takes potshots at Bush and other conservatives at any given chance. Other than that gripe, he's enjoyable and has good humor. Readings he chooses are fun and well picked, but the topics he wants you to understand can be broad and vague. I did not enjoy the class because the writing style needed is odd.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not too hard if you know what he is looking for. He jokes around a lot, which is great! Makes the class VERY enjoyable. He is extremely helpful and willing to make an effort. Lots of homework, but it's simple stuff, nothing that takes more then 15 mins before class! (except for the papers) Take him, he's an awesome prof! Strict on attendence.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2005<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No. Don't do it. The only people that enjoyed this class, are faking it because they're so scared of him and are still sucking up to this guy.  His jokes are not funny; they are offensive.  His remarks make me question how he is a professor. No matter how many times you revise, there will ALWAYS be something wrong in your paper.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2005<br>Class Name: ENGLISH103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very intelligent man, and makes things fun.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/19/2005<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Despite the mixed reviews, I think that if you can handle an instructor that considers you an equal, and refuses to &quot;kid handle&quot; you - then you would probably enjoy him. He's funny and self assured, and a great teacher. He is also not afraid to level with students and be blatently honest, which, can be a rarity. Try him!

He's a decent grader-but you have to work to get an &quot;a&quot;- which is funny cuz it's english 104...not some crazy advanced class. I think he was made fun of a lot as a kid-he's taking it out us in his later years. He tries too much to be the &quot;cool&quot; guy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2005<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2005<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Markwell is a very funny guy, he makes class fun BUT he is really conceited.
