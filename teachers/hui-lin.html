She straight up lets you know what is on the exams and she has 3 exams to spread out instead of just the basic finalmid-term so 1 test won't hurt you that bad. She also has review sessions before the test to go over material that will be on the test and understanding the concept. She is the best. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2014<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor.

If you do the homework and review problems she gives before exams you should be fine. Her exams are kind of long though so there's NO time to dwell on questions you don't know.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2014<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Lin is an exemplary educator. Her lectures are clear and intuitive. Her pre-exam review lectures are right on point with the exams. But most importantly, Porf. Lin genuinely cares about her students, and is always an email away if your feeling lost. She even goes out of her way to host optional exam reviews during non-class hours.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2014<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is not a bad teacher but I wouldn't take again. Group project wasn't worth it. Went through some things rather fast. Tests can be confusing if you don't study enough. I won't say to not take her, but be prepared to work. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2014<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Lin is a very professional, nice professor. A definite must take if you are an accounting major, and always willing to help. She is very understanding and gives lots of extra credit. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/25/2014<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher. Would take again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2014<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good professor. She cares about her students. Easy A if you do homework.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2013<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Lin is a great professor who was always willing to help students. It is a tough subject matter, but she makes the topic as easy as possible. I would recommend taking 306 or any other course she teaches to all students. You will work on CPA exam questions, while actually remembering the principles behind them. Definitely take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2013<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Best Accounting professor at DePaul. Gives the class an option to either take 2 exams or 3 exams during the quarter. Take the 3 exam option! There's a group paper which is manageable, and homework. If you do the homework you will get full points. She gives extra credit too.  If you don't get at least a B in this class, good luck in life!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2013<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The business letter is easy, you get EC throughout the course for easy stuff - like submitting a paragraph on a professional event you went to. There is EC on all 3 tests. Group project is a little difficult but not bad. She tells you exactly what is on the test and will do whatever she can to help you understand and do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2012<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The most dedicated professor ever. She genuinely cares about her students and after spending 7 years in undergrad she has inspired and taught me the most. Teaching comes naturally to her and would do wonders as a professor in any classroom. Anyone who doesnt do good in her class didnt even try a little bit because i didnt try too hard & did fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2012<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>EXCELLENT professor.  I'm an accounting major and usually HATE it.  Professor Lin made accounting bearable and I like the way her tests were broken down into two chapters each.  She always explains everything thoroughly, so I didn't feel left in the dark like I normally do.  I would take her again if I had the chance, one of my favorites.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2012<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was super easy as long as you study,. Her exam was straightforward from review and homework</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/19/2012<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am currently enrolled in Prof Lin's class and acc 306 is a tough, as expected. However, Prof LIn does everything she can to make it clear for students and I think she is an excellent professor.  Just read the book, go to class, and study!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2011<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Grades based on Homework, Midterm, Final, Group project. Tests are hard and you will need all the time you can get. Nice teacher but runs through material and practice problems.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2011<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her tests are really hard but she gives a decent curve. Really nice but doesn't really know how to explain the topics clearly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2011<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is a business letter, mid term,final, homework, and group project. She goes so fast through the material. She expects everyone to understand the Accounting. Only 3 As in my class. 93 or higher is an A. It would be better to take Recchia or Trendell. It will be worth the wait and well worth picking those teachers as they fill up quick.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/09/2011<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Solid teacher. Very helpful.

I'm not the smartest in Strobels, but here's my opinion. Clear, open to office hours, easy work for easy points, a fairly easy team project, 3 tests with 2 chapters each. The tests are tricky though. Studying definitely helps but just be careful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/13/2011<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2009<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ignore the last rating on ACC 102.  Dr. Lin was a good professor - sure she had high expectations but she was also willing to help.  The class was hard for an intro. class but she made us think and not just memorize everything.  I enjoyed her class but expect to work hard and earn your grade!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2009<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Has no teaching experience at all, and you can never understand what she is saying.
