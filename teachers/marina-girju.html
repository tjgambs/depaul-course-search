She is a tough grader on the essay portion of the exams but gives you ten of the multiple choice questions during the review. There was a group project (2 papers and presentation), midterm, final, attendance and participation.  Shes not the best but not the worst. If you have no other good options take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2015<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Read the material, study it, get a good group, and participate.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2015<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great professor :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2015<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>she is very helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2015<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>She is very helpful.

I obviously want to learn, but at the same time if felt like too much was being thrown at us at once.  My advice would be to spread out things a little more, give some more EC, and shorten the exams just a bit. With those things, she'd be set. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2014<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good class. Lots of teste and exams and applied projects. Lots of studying but all material? are prezentei well, lectures are recorded, lots of stories given as examples. Tough grader for class participation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2014<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent class. She makes it look easy, but there is a lot to learn with lots of details. Exams are hard and long. The professor is very knowledgeable, professional and always ready to help. She is available any time for questions. Learned a lot and loved the stories. Math seems easy but it is not. You learn marketing in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2014<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Half the class is online which was a complete joke. The midterm and final had an online portion that was 50-60 minutes online, so Google searching was convenient. The midterm and final are EXACT questions from the study guides. The group project is an absolute joke and everyone got 100% on everything. Good blow off class, but not good for MKT Major</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2014<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Girju is a great professor. She is a very knowledable marketer who backed up the class material with her experiences working for Frito-Lay--very helpful to know! LOTS of extra credit opportunites. One thing I'd wished was better was her clarity in lectures. Sometimes she was hard to understand. Anyway, she is great and also a sweet person.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2014<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>She was a good professor very knowledgeable and she is very cool. She keeps the class interest and if you go to classes you get a good amount of extra credit which is always helpful!!!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2013<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have never had a teacher act more unprofessional to end a class. Did not control lengths of group presentations. Most groups got 30 mins. Cut the final two groups off before 10 minutes. Blamed whole class for having terrible final exam grades when they had good midterm .Completely changed my view of her. Look at your test before u criticize us.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2013<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a sweet lady. Class is super easy and she gives out extra credit like it's candy. Definitely recommend taking her if you need to take this class.</div></div></div></body></html>
