His 102 summer class was so fun and I took his Chicago radio history class as an elective over intersession and it was great.  Scott is a good dude.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/02/2014<br>Class Name: MCS389<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His first, second, and third concerns are making sure that he seems "cool" in front of the class. Actually teaching you information is fairly low on his priority list. That said, he's a fair and thorough grader. Take him because you want access to good equipment, not because you want to learn from him. Otherwise you'll be disappointed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2014<br>Class Name: MCS341<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Vyverman is THE best. Passionate about what he teaches and wants to pass on his knowledge to you. Always willing to chat with you about schoolwork, your final paper, or life in general. The class is three quizzes, a final, and a final paper. ALSO that voice. A+ Highly recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2014<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Literally one of the best professors out there. Woke up everyday excited to go to his class and was extremely disappointed when it was over. Take him! Absolutely great experience.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2014<br>Class Name: COM102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Vyverman is definitely funny and has a great sense of humor. His classes are pretty straightforward - he has some facts on a powerpoint and then he talks a lot and has a mix of interesting and nonsensical information. Sometimes his opinions and offhand comments rubbed me the wrong way but definitely 10/10 would recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2013<br>Class Name: COM102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have taken 3 classes with Prof Vyverman. They are not hard, but not easy. If you show up and do things on time he is more than willing to forgive a transgression or two. A passionate guy. A good teacher with a huge array of obscure pop culture knowledge.  Seriously. Vyverman is good peeps.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2013<br>Class Name: L111116<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fun class.

He is an expert on radio and absolutely loves what he does. Personally, I found him to be a big kid at heart. He is extremely lenient and often times tries to make funny jokes. If you want an easy A, then definitely take him. You will still learn at the same time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2011<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I absolutely love him. He knows so much about radio, and it shows. He's funny, and he's one of the most laid-back professors I've had. Legitimately teaches life lessons and lessons about radio that aren't preachy and clearly come from experience. It was a great first class at DePaul, and it was a ton of fun. Plus, you get Billy Goat food!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2010<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely easy class.  Do not buy the newest version of the text book and it will save you about $100.  Allowed to miss one class, but a majority of the class was never there.  Discussions were often very interesting</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2009<br>Class Name: RADIOBROA<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The radio broadcasting class wasnt too bad. you get to broadcast live from the depaul radio station. its pretty fun. one thing i didnt like was that when you broadcast, you do it with a group. and your grade depends on your own, and your group's performace. i thought it was a little unfair for my grade to suffer if someone in my group didnt do well</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2009<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>pretty easy class. visit radio stations. one midterm.. all from his notes, you really dont even need to read the book. research paper towards the end but it isnt bad. the guy knows his stuff although he can come across as cocky at times.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/28/2009<br>Class Name: MSC339<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is amazing! I look forward to his classes because he is very entertaining. Class is challenging, but as long as you apply yourself, you shouldn't have a hard time. He really has a full grasp on radio and is a perfect person to teach the class because he has field experience. He's Great! I definitely recommend his class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2009<br>Class Name: EXPLRCHIC<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Vyverman was one of my first teachers at DePaul, i had him for Chicago Quarter. He knows his**** about radio and it completely passionate about it; however, i feel like i learned more life lessons from his radio class than i did about radio. For being 40 something, this guy knows what's up. Take him. He will not disappoint.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2008<br>Class Name: CMN341<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors I've ever had in communication--he'll answer any question you have and try his best to be helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2008<br>Class Name: RADIO202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok I sorta agree with the last person after being in his class so far. You like him because he is the opposite of academic professors, on the other hand you realize why those people are actual &quot;Professors&quot; and he is not. easy A but prb not for you if you are serious about Radio. Thanks!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2008<br>Class Name: RADIO101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's funny but he also a bit arrogant even though he knows his stuff. My biggest problem with him was that he didn't seem to actually care about his students. take him because he's an easy grader, but don't expect him to go above and beyond what a real professor does for his students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2008<br>Class Name: ROCKRADI<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ive said it before and ill say it again...Best Professor I have ever had...I actually look forward to his classes, because i know it is stuff i will use.  If you have the chance to take a class with him, you must do it.  I dont understand some of the ratings on here, but forget those.  He is a great PROFESSOR!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2008<br>Class Name: CMN341<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Vyvermen twice and I liked him a lot as a teacher. He was funny and class didn't seem to drag. I learned a lot from his classes. I'm taking a History of Broadcasting class now, and it's a breeze thanks to him. Everyone saying mean comments don't know what they are talking about and are not very nice people!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2008<br>Class Name: CMN341<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've taken him twice now because I think he's a great teacher.  I always look forward to his classes and if you study what he teaches you then you will always get a good grade.  Some of the comments I've read on here about him are ridiculous.  Ask anyone who is not a moron- Vyverman is definitely one of the best comm. profs at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2008<br>Class Name: CMN339<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Teacher f you thought radio broadcasting was a hard class, you just did show up.

He's more real than other professors at Depaul. I like his comments and jokes, they got me through the class. I would definetly take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2007<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is one of the most interesting professors at DePaul.

Yeah he does talk about himself, but he does it for a purpose. Take his class and you will probably like it. He doesnt ask for much, and hes more laidback than some people let on. I would definitely take him again, and enjoy going to his class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2007<br>Class Name: CMN339<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this class blew. hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2007<br>Class Name: CMN339<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He talks about himself alot, doesn't really guide you in the studio all that much, lazy professor if you ask me. Rambles on and on about himself, didn't even care to allow us to introduce ourselves on the first day.I barely heard students talk. Football played attitude indeed...I have lost ALL interest in Radio after this class. Such a waste of spa</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/18/2007<br>Class Name: CMN339<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Teacher!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/07/2006<br>Class Name: CMN339<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He works at Dairy Queen to make extra money.

I don't think he's arrogant-as other people have posted, if I knew my radio history as well as he does - heck, I'd be just as confident as he is!  Let's not confuse confidence with arrogance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2006<br>Class Name: RADIOPRODUCTIO<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Scott thinks he is right no matter what anybody tells him.  He once compared his radio ratings to that of mancow during the time he was on the air.  Waht a joke.  Only thing interesting is that you get to be on air for Radio DePaul.  Too bad it's a requirement.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2005<br>Class Name: EXPLOREISP102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors!!
