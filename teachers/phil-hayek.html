He will give a reading and then during the next class, show us a youtube video that is not only entertaining, but relates to the class.

Also, fantastic facial hair.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Phil is a great professor!
