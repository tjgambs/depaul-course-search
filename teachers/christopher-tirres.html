Clearly Tirres doesn't expect people to have jobs or any other responsibilities aside the class because he assigns a ridiculous amount of work. I've taken summer classes at Depaul online before and none of them had this much work.  Also all the dates on his syllabus are wrong. No help there.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/13/2015<br>Class Name: 257<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Chris Tirres is an AMAZING professor - if you actually want to learn. "Death" is NOT an easy A class. I fell behind a few times because he expects you to have homework handed in multiple times per week. I suggest taking it to learn a lot, but also: make study guides, do the readings (or at least skim), and then all the tests will be SO EASY! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2014<br>Class Name: REL257<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Tirres is a very, VERY smart guy. I enrolled in the class thinking it wouldn't be too hard and thought it'd be a good way to clear my religion credit-- if this is how you are thinking, stop now. Don't take this class unless you like heavy, heavy reading, homework due 3 times per week, and tests with essay questions. Very hard class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2014<br>Class Name: CTH182<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Tirres is amazing at what he does. He knows his stuff and is willing to help. What I loved most about him is his learning assessments. He gives out questionnaires in order to gain feedback from the student about what he can change in the way he runs the classroom in order to increase our learning. He genuinely cares about his students.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2014<br>Class Name: REL113<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super nice, learned a lot, and had a fun class, however he does give out  a lot of readings and work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2012<br>Class Name: REL257<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy that really cares about his students, but you have to teach yourself everything with 3 assignments due a week (Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday). All of them require a good amount of reading and comprehension so don't think this will be an easy class. Plan on committing at least 4-5 hours a week to it if you want an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2011<br>Class Name: REL113<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is the bestttt teacher at depaul. he tries do hard to engage his students. he is funny, passionate, interesting, and adorable</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2010<br>Class Name: REL257<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is not even about &quot;Death and Its Beyond!.&quot; Tirres barely teaches but assigns long readings and mandatory blackboard postings every night. The exams are straight facts tho, so basically memorize the readings, write it down, and you will get an A. You will teach yourself in this course but still be required to attend every class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2010<br>Class Name: REL113<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really helpful and is very knowledgable. Shows interesting movies. Reading is crucial for online questions/ comments. Stresses participation and attendence. Tries to be funny, sometimes is. Overall fun guy who makes class engaging. Brought a dance group to class to teach us some moves towards the end of the quarter. Easy grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2010<br>Class Name: REL113<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor! Came into this class not interested in the subject, but left enlightened. There is a lot of reading but there are actually quite enjoyable. Also, he gives you so many extra credit opportunities its hard not to get and A in the class. His teaching style is so great and unlike any professor I had before. Take him for religion!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2010<br>Class Name: REL113<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is quite enjoyable. We watch films, do readings and have discussions based on those readings. We listen to Latin music that relates to the theme of the class. Tirres is a good professor and is very outgoing. There are readings for almost every class and they can be pretty long, but it is college. Deal With It.Keep up with the readings.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2008<br>Class Name: REL113<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't mind this class. A good option for a religion requirement. 2 essays, one midterm, homework. Pretty lenient grader and nice guy. The material is ok, but nothing too exciting. I would def. recommend the class though. Tirres is a class act.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2008<br>Class Name: REL257<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is ridiculous!!! and Mr. Tirres is like a bad joke. Not only that he doesn't know !*#& about death and cultural traditions, he will make you teach the class in his place. I find him somewhat politicaly manipulative... YOU WILL NEED TO WRITE SHORT SUMMARY 2 TIMES AWEEK,4TEST,2 RESEARCH PAPERS AND FINAL. STAY AWAY!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2008<br>Class Name: REL257<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is not about death and its beyond!!!I am an A student.Mr. Tirres don't know anything about the subject. he can't teach anything in class. He will ask you to read 1000 pages and then summry them(because he have no idea about them)He will try to push his political and religion agenda on you. 3 midterms,R.paper 4page,final 9 P.do not take</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2007<br>Class Name: RELIGSECT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>simply a wonderful teacher, his enthusiasm is contagious. very knowledgeable on the subject as well as effective teaching methods. he wont bore you, he changes things up every class. relies heavily on reading, and the tests are hard unless you do the reading and pay attention to class discussions. will work with you if you need extensions.</div></div></div></body></html>
