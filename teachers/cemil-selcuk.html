He is not very personable, but explains always if someone asks or has a problem understanding. Attend class, you will have a quiz every time and this is part of your grade.

Most professors at DePaul are not very good at teaching this subject but Professor Selcuk is the exception.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2009<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a smart guy, good professor over all.

He does his best to make this class interesting but the material is boring. I got a B in the class and it was tough for me. The online only version of this class has open book tests and I would take that section had I known.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this guy is super nice. definitely take gsb420 from him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy professor -- if you are good at math. Professor Selcuk speaks extremely quietly, so if you don't have the mathematical aptitude to begin with then you'll find it hard to follow. While his tests are multiple choice, some of them are incomprehensible word problems from the text. Overall, this is the version of GSB 420 to take.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cemil is a very nice guy. Sit to the front of the class so you can hear and see his work on the board. This is the worst class of the program overall.  Cemil is probably one of the top two at teaching it. Homework each week which takes about 2-3 hours. Test are multiple choice but difficult. I got an A-.  Cemil or Epstein are your best bets!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is alot of work (you go through alot more chapters in the book the other classes) but I would still recommend it over the other GSB 420 course b/c the exams are multiple choice so you have a better chance of getting a good grade.  You have to work hard for it but you can get an A.  Good Teacher, but alot of work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/26/2008<br>Class Name: ECO380<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The material is difficult, the book is useless, can't understanding a thing.. His lectures are boring, but at least better than reading the book. On the positive side, he knows his math and explains well if you ask questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cemil is a good teacher.

Very disorganized and difficult to understand; if you sit beyond the 4th row in class, you won't hear a thing.  oh...lowest A was set at 95%!  who does that for a graduate level course in stats&#63;&#63;&#63;  minitab software is used for homework which is useless in the real world, should teach using excel.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2008<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Attendence is not mandatory, all HW is online on applia, you pay $70 for applia with online book. Midterm is straight off practice tests and book. Doesn't speak english well but know's his Econ. Aplia HW + Midterm + Final + End Presentation = a preety easy A. I'd take him again.</div></div></div></body></html>
