Her lectures are long but they are very interesting and relate to real life. She gives many examples relate the concepts to the real experience in life, so it makes me understand easily. Not only that, she also post all of her powerpoints and study guides. I learn so much from this class.

I walked into it loving psychology, and walked out loving it even more. The lecture's were interesting and funny, and she connects everything to something in the real world, so it's that much easier to understand.

Would definitely recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2013<br>Class Name: PSY317<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A good professor that made good use of our time. Topics were interesting and highly relatable. I did have her for a 3 week course though, a lot of reading but well worth it. I felt underprepared going into her tests, but came out with high grades on both.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2012<br>Class Name: PSY317<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredible course. Excellent teacher who kept the material fresh and pertinent with analogies, anecdotes and class discussion. Was tenative to take an intersession course (because of length of lectures) but Professor Luhrs kept me interested the entire time, every time! Minimal work; study for exams and ask questions and its an easy class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2012<br>Class Name: PSY317<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr.Luhrs is the best.

Very helpful, friendly, and down to earth--not at all one of those people who gets off on being in a position of power. Take a class with her and have a smoke with her--ask her about her life...pretty interesting stuff!

The TA and prof did not communicate with each other and I didn't learn anything.  I wasted my time going to class to sit there and listen to people's life story it felt like a therapy session.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2011<br>Class Name: PSY305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Luhrs class was awesome.

Time consuming</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2010<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her employment, much less position as a department head at Depaul makes me embarrassed to be a student at Depaul.  We learned nothing, weren't challenged, and were allowed to use our books/notes on tests.  Toatl blowoff class, easy A.  I played video games on my phone the whole quarter and got an A.  This class and teacher are an absolute joke.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2009<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class. You have 3 tests for the entire quarter and they are all open book, open note, open lecture notes. Going to class doesn't matter because she lets you use the power point slides and the book on your exams. Read the chapters and print out the power points and you will get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2008<br>Class Name: PSYCH305<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy, she really doesn't teach, she talks more about her personal life than than the txt book.Easy A but you really don't learn anything useful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2008<br>Class Name: PSYCH305<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT Prof!!  A little difficult to get in contact with - via email, etc., sometimes takes a bit long to respond.  Otherwise, easy, as long as you show up, read, and take notes!  Would take her again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2007<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easiest class I've taken at DePaul. No hw except for 5 projects that can be taking a survey or writing a 1-2 page summary of a psych article. Also an easy final paper. Puts all lectures on blackboard so you don't need to go to class and barely use the book. Really nice, approachable and wants you to succeed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2007<br>Class Name: PSYC105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's really nice and she really wants to help! Psyc 105-106 was a breeze as long as you go over the powerpoint.

Even though some of the classes were canceled last quarter without any warning, she did try her best to get people involved.  The class is fairly easy if you do all the readings.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2007<br>Class Name: PSY305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Going to this class every afternoon was a complete waste of time!!!  I do not know what any of these students were talking about--she is a horrible professor!!!  Yes, the class is not difficult, but I came to learn something.  This is not a good class to take especially if you are a psychology major (don't learn anything new).  Easy, but terrible!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2006<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2006<br>Class Name: PSY305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Its funny how we pay DePaul $20K+/year for school and they **** us out to community service projects.  Oh well, this class was easy, Luhrs is cool.  Don't go to class unless you want to hear about Lurhs' personal stories and the stories of disaffected youth, just read the short stories in the syllabus.  Cool lady, easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2006<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really great sense of humor, interesting class, tells great personal stories for examples and extremely kind woman.

She's increadibly funny and personable, the 3 hour classes fly by with her.  The work load was easy: 2 take home tests, 1 paper and a presentation.  And she is an easy grader.

Her main goal here was for the student to actively connect psychological ideas and principles to the realm of social justice...which of course requires the student to think outside the box---NOT to expect her to tell you everything. A fair and easy grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: RESEARCHMETHOD<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very clear, powerpoints straight from book and tests straight from powerpoints which are e-mailed to everyone.

Extremely unclear. Easy class, though, ethier do the readings or go to class, I don't think both are necessary for an A.  Nice woman, just needs to TEACH, I learned about students personal lives, not PSY, spent 1 day on Soc Justice. Nice, but a bad teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2005<br>Class Name: PSYANDSOCIAL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teacher I have ever had.
