Field trips were to boring places/pretty sketchy places, homework/readings was boring and made no sense, lectures sounded repetitive. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2014<br>Class Name: ART200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Harp is incredible. His class "Art and Artists in Contemporary Culture" changed how I viewed art, which is a big deal if you are an art student (like I am). He's very knowledgable but still listens to students in a serious way. Very nice, funny, and interested. He's also a straightforward and fair grader. Definitely recommend. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2014<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He can be a bit unclear at times, but his class was pretty fun. One day, he literally told us to wander around for two hours.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2014<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was terrible. I signed up for the Explore class Photographing Chicago's Landscapes expecting to be taking a photography class. No. All Professor Harp wants to do is lecture us about the word landscape. Also, he grades the weekly papers on whether or not your interpretation of the reading matched his. TAKE A DIFFERENT EXPLORE CLASS.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2014<br>Class Name: ART118<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Harp is awesome. Honestly just participate, and respond to readings even if you don't understand and he'll love you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2014<br>Class Name: ART118<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Harp was nice and passionate about photography but sometimes class was boring and the subjects were confusing.  Only 1 photo assignment, a few papers.  If you like history and philosophy of photography you will like it.  If not, take a different class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2013<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Harp wa sone of the BEST Depaul profs I've taken!

The class is almost entirely classroom discussion with five or six field photo assignments.  Talk as much as possible even if you think you're wrong, he prefers any kind discussion as apposed to none.  There are readings due every class but they're short, and some films as well.  Take one of his classes he's grea</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2007<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>most boring class ive taken so far but its easy and the guy is really nice he tries his hardest to make it easiest for you. not much work and grades easy as long as u show u put a lot of effort into it. highly recommended for focal point</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2006<br>Class Name: ART325<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love him as a person, but the class readings and lectures are so boring that have the class falls asleep. He is enthusiastic about the topics but the movies he makes us watch are stupid and boring. But he is a wonderful man and knows his stuff. He is helpful and can motivate you when it is one on one with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2006<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
