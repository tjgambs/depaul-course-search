My favorite professor at DePaul by far. She is just such a kind person and made her classroom a very comfortable space to learn in. She encouraged us each to do our best and expected grade A work from each of us, but with her encouragement it was easy to do. Can't wait to take another Stephanie Howell class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2014<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved taking Explore Spoken Word with Stephanie! Such a wonderful, open minded lady. You have to keep a journal, give three presentations during the quarter, take a handful of quizzes and a final exam (its a paper) for your grade. She's really wonderful though, and you go on quite a few outings together. No textbook, she has all readings online.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2014<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stephanie Howell is a great professor.

Discussions were open, it's a non-judging zone and really fun. We talk about REAL topics and watch documentaries that pertain to real life.

The reading material is not scholarly. She's out of touch, still talking like we live in the 80s or 90s. She's also not very open to any viewpoints outside of her own. Easy class, to be sure, but if you're interested in the subject and have some gender studies background knowledge, don't expect much.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/29/2012<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was one of the best teachers I ever had a DePaul.

Took her for LGBT Civil Rights, I found the topic very interesting and enjoyed the class discussions. She is very kind and considerate towards her students.

You're lame if you don't rate her well based on the class content that you're too narrow-minded to digest (yes, this is directed to the LGBT classmates). Shes fun, she cares, shes understanding. Attendance required but it's worth it to show up. Not hard but not blow off either.

She has an interactive teaching style rather then lecturing for the whole class.  She is very fun and likes to make class fun.  Every class there is a question of the day such as &quot;What is your favorite pizza place&#63;&quot;  She is quite an interesting person but I love Stepahine and her class!  STRONGLY RECOMEND!!</div></div></div></body></html>
