Not just in college, but my whole school career. The professor rarely explained anything, overcomplicated things, left out vital information from tests, and waited until the last day to grade anything.  If this hadn't been required for my major I would have dropped it within a week.  Avoid at all cost.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/20/2010<br>Class Name: IM220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Whole class hated the way he ran the course. Didn't seem well planned (lots of repeat from IM 210), presentations often ran overtime. Said straight out he didn't know actionscript very well (whole point of class). Partner & I managed an A. If you've never touched the adobe suite--avoid! Didn't grade things on time. Good guy but shouldn't teach.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2010<br>Class Name: IM220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take this guy! He did not grade any of the homework until the last day that grades were due so basically you have no idea how you are doing in the class until you receive your final grade. Stay away from this guy unless you like having someone screw with your gpa with his terrible grading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2010<br>Class Name: IM220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is ridiculous. He needs to be fired and an unfair grader. He reads directly off the ppt lectures and does not explain what you really have to do for an assignment.  Winter quarter the Dean of Students was contacted and AMAZINGLY we all passed. I wonder why...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2010<br>Class Name: IM220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is terrible he the semester is over and he has only graded one out of the 5 assignments that we had 1!!!. Its hard to do the next assignment when it is built off the previous one and you do not know if you are doing that one right to begin with. Stay far far away from this guy he's terrible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2010<br>Class Name: ITIT<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is by far the worst professor I've had at DePaul.  His teaching method is so hard to follow. He doesn't grade ANY homework so you're completely lost the whole time. And he never responded to any of my emails. So if you're not an IT major I would really advise you to not take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2010<br>Class Name: IM210<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was incredibly boring. I pay too much on tuition for a teacher to read directly from the powerpoint slide which has info straight from the book. The midterm was very hard and the final is incredibly easy with EC questions from midterm on it! This guy doesn't really know how to teach.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2010<br>Class Name: IM210<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Goes through material way too fast and clearly doesn't like teaching. Could be a good teacher if he slowed down and relaxed a bit. I don't recommend taking a class from him until he gets a few more under his belt.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2010<br>Class Name: IM210<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He...is ok. Just for reference, the highest grade on our midterm was like a 77. You be the judge of that. Take it with caution</div></div></div></body></html>
