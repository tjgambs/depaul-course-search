She never went thru the syllabus & is SO unclear about hw instructions. Then she grades however she sees fit, not according to her guidelines she previously gave. EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING. Do yourself a huge favor & take it with any other prof! If it wasn't too late, I'd drop it.

She challenges peoples'common misconceptions in a level headed and kind way.

Dr. Farah is interesting and nice, but if you don't do the readings, you won't get anything out of this class.  She rarely covered any important material in class and mostly just talked about herself.  She also assigns alot of homework and attendance is mandatory.  She is very passionate, just unorganized.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2006<br>Class Name: WMS200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible class!!!!  The class was full of feminist who were so full of themselves it was laughable, she herself wasn't that bad, but she never bothered to stand up for students with different opinions and basically allowed immature girls with too many outrageous opinions run the class.
