This is a freshman level class that consumes more time than all of my intermediate Finance classes combined.  Useless assignments and useless lectures.  He is a very tough grader.  This course should be removed from the university.  The entire class time feels like pulling teeth.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/28/2014<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: C</div><div id="right"><div>I rarely rate professors poorly because most of their teaching styles and expectations can be understood and adapted to...however....This professor makes this easy course needlessly confusing, avoids giving help (or does so with an attitude) and scatters necessary information around for students to play hide-and-seek in order to find.

These bad ratings scared me before the class started, but I didn't think it was bad. His assignments are so easy, the major assignment is the research paper which you work on for like half the quarter!

But he tells you what he expects in the online lectures. 4 cases, 1 case due every week, the longest one is 1.5 page. He let you do drafts and 1 rewrite for the first 2 cases. Watch the online lectures! They help your cases a lot. Weekly quizzes, the lowest score one is dropped.

This class is a waste of time. And this opinion comes from a guy who writes tons of email and communications in the real corporate world. He punishes for creativity and personal touch.

Enthusiastic. Yes, he's picky but for good reason. Will learn something. He's not very helpful b/c he's paranoid that will give away the &quot;solutions&quot; to writing these cases. However, put in the effort & it'll pay off.

When I say he's a hard grader, I mean he tells you nothing about what he looks for when he grades, and he'll rag on you for not including the most insignificant details.

He is a very hard grader. Everything is very dated the book hasn't been published in 10-15 years. When other classes are doing resumes and other relevant things we were doing memos that aren't used in offices anymore. He is not clear on what he wants and hasn't realized that the business world uses e-mail now!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2009<br>Class Name: WORD202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!! Biggest ass at DePaul. Not only is his class pointless (drafting e-mails and office memos) he is an extremely difficult grader.  Diction and a style of writing that would get you an A in any other Word class is at best a B in his.  Do yourself a favor and take this class with a different professor.  Boring, rude and a tool.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2009<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>if you want an A, just listen to what he wants on every assignment. Making your own ideas and assumptions will pretty much fail you. He is a rough teacher, but allows rewrites and gives alot of notes when editing, so just change it to what he wants and you got the A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2008<br>Class Name: WRD204<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One word says it all.  Pathetic.  I have never met a professor who grades so unfairly.  He is a slightly prejudice person. Overall, I think a small bar of soap is more knowledgeable than he is.

His class was challenging but informative.  He demands a standard that I think all University students should be able to meet.  I saw that someone wrote that he was mean-that is bunk.

He is not a very nice or approachable person and his grading is ridiulous. I have never gotten below a B on ANYTHING and I got a C+ on a paper I worked really hard on.

You will have no idea what this man is asking for on his &quot;papers&quot;.  I literally revised a paper by adding bullets and changed my grade on it from a c+ to an a.

The professor is not bad at all; the secret is following his suggestions. If you wanna do things your own way you're not gonna do well.
