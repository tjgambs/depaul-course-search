I have taken him for two classes already and he is amazing. His classes are always super interesting and engaging. He definitely expects you to put forth effort into his class, but he is more than willing to help you in any way he can.

At first I was worried that he doesn't use powerpoints and only writes his notes on the board before each class, but it ended up being my favorite teaching style. Tim is so passionate about his studies and makes everything insanely clear. The topic of this course specifically blew my mind. The papers are easy reflections. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2014<br>Class Name: RELC500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Can I take Professor Cole for every class?

He is extremely knowledgable and clearly loves what he does. He is extremely clear with examples. Every time I have ever emailed him, I have received a response within the hour (usually far less), which is super helpful.

He scribbles an outline on the board, which I found hard to read, and then paces around the room, which I found distracting. Also, theres a horrendous group project(45 min presentation and 10 page group paper) so if you hate those avoid this class. It counts for 25% of you grade YUCK!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2012<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Cole was very interesting and kept the class fun.

He keeps his classes interesting & is able to relate his teachings to real life experiences. His grading style I'd say is based off of what he expects from that particular student ie on a paper I tried really hard on & prepared for I got 100, when I didn't I got a 97.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2012<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Holy wow... must for a communications major.

I had Tim this year and his half of the class just ended. Where to begin when talking about Tim&#63; He's by far the best professor I have. By a country mile.

Take him!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/12/2010<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've only had one class of his so far, but already I know how much I like him. He jumped into his lecture on the first day, and I have to say I was extremely interested. He's incredibly thorough in his lectures, and really prompts students to take part. I'm excited for the rest of the quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2010<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT Professor!

You will learn a lot in this class that you didn't know. Attendance is not mandatory but I will reiterate what someone else said and claim that you won't want to miss class. Only 1 paper and 1 exam for his half of the class so you have to make it count. I would strongly suggest him, if you can take him do it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2010<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher I've had so far.

He talks nervously but intelligently, it's funny. I talked to him after class a couple of times about some topics that interested me and he expanded on what he taught and recommended books-- he's really knowledgeable and willing to help out folks interested in the class.  I'm thinking about getting his face tattooed on my hip.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2009<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His lectures were so interesting.

He didn't lecture much in this class, but when he did, he was thought-provoking and uninitimidating (which is rare at DePaul).  For everyone that is dreading to take your capstone, I highly recommend you take it with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2008<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teachers at DePaul.  He really knows his stuff and talks about it with a passion. I really enjoyed the lecture.  What is more improtant though is the fact that he is very understanding and willing to help you if needed. So do not hesitate to ask him question becaue it is your grade, and he will help you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2008<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was cool, accepted opinions, and taught in a way that was interesting. I actually learned something in his class. We discussed relationships for his half, and something always happens that makes me think about the things I learned. It was well worth the time spent. He's not too bad to look at either ;)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2008<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Keeps the class interesting and is clearly very good with the subject matter.

He has a talent for putting things into their simplest terms. I learned a lot in his class. He is also entertaining!

He was funny and made things interesting, and the reading really only came in handy when it came time for the midterm. Though when I approached him he seemed uninterested what I had to say, really didn't seem to care. He's a 50/50 I'd say.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2006<br>Class Name: CMN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is clear, organized, friendly, fun, and hot!
