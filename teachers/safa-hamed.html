If she is teaching.... Take her! she explains everything in a way that is easy to understand and shows you the simple way to solve the problem</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2013<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is one of the best professors at DePaul. She actually cares about the students and she wants you to succeed. Attendance is mandatory but you definitely need to be there anyway. She gives you a chance to demonstrate your understanding and will be there until you get it. I will definitely take more courses with her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2012<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Grade: Each 25% midterm n final, 50% HW, participation, n attendance. The single best math professor I have ever had the privilege of taking. Math has always been a personal challenge but she changed that. Really cares about her students. Her teaching is second to none. If you have the chance of taking her, do it before her class fills up.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2012<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Prof. Hamed for both MAT 135 and 136 over two different summers. She is one of the best math teachers that I've ever had. You have to do homework on MyMathLab, but it's actually helpful in learning the material. If you're confused, she'll help you until you understand it. I can't speak highly enough of her. She only teachers summers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2012<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is so sweet and really helpful. I hate math but I go see her before class and ask her all my questions. I am so happy I chose this class with her. You do all the class on MathLab, which helps you solve step by step, so thats good for me. Attendence in mandnatory. We use online book version so dont buy the hard copy, saves you $</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2011<br>Class Name: MTH095<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Let's just say, I learned more within the first four weeks of class than I did in 4 years in high school. I actually really enjoy math now, which is shocking. Best teacher to take Math from, hands down!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2011<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hate math and I'm terrible at it, but prof Hamed helped me every step of the way.  I didn't do very well on the tests or quizzes, but I did all the homework and showed up to every class and ended up with a B.  I wouldn't recommend any other professor for math</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2010<br>Class Name: CALC135<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOME!!!!!

Math is not my thing (at all), and I thoroughly enjoyed every second of Prof. Hamed's class. She has a great sense of humor and is also beautiful. She genuinely cares about her students and does everything she can to help the succeed. I would take any other class with her again if I could. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2010<br>Class Name: MAT095<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't do well only because I didn't apply myself or put forth any effort- in retrospect, it was a big waste of a good professor. She cares plenty for the students and their success. Her class was very easy and anyone can excel if they put any effort into the course.  She's also amazingly gorgeous.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2009<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No one should do bad in this class if they made any sort of attempt. She makes it so easy to do well, basically gives you the exam with her practice exams. If you understand the practice exam and acutally do the practice exam there should be no problem.She is very sassy. I enjoyed her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/26/2009<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SHE IS A GREAT PROF.

She grades fairly easy especially on hw and quizzes. There are 3 test she gets rid of your lowest one so that helps alot. Not a bad teacher knows her stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2005<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>THE ABSOLUTE BEST math teacher at DePaul.

She gave us a chapter quiz after the chapter test...huh&#63; She only has 30 mins. for her office hours and when you seek assistence, she tells you to see the tutor, who may or may not help. She's nice, but not thorough. I recommennd Zazi or Goes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2005<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a good teacher.
