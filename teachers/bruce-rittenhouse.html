Lectures are generally boring but informative. Likes to give &quot;case studies&quot;. Partcipation and attendance play a important role in your grade. Consists of a lot of boring readings. No tests or quizzes other than final which is another case study. Ultilizes &quot;Blackboard&quot; a lot.</div></div></div></body></html>
