She is one of those professors whose experience matters and she will give you every personal story she can to help you understand the topic. I have learned so much from her, she is tough but well worth it. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/23/2014<br>Class Name: INTC337<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I absolutely adore Professor Lucy. She is one of the most inspiring, intelligent, and wonderful professors in the INTC department at DePaul. She makes you feel like a colleague of hers and loves hearing the students speak and come up with their own answers to things. She is extremely funny and fun to be in class with. Highly recommended</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2011<br>Class Name: COM103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is excited about teaching. When you have an exam make sure you know what author from the readings she assigns said what. She has a lot of short answer questions regarding that.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2010<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is probably the kindest professor I've ever had. She is genuinely interested in the topic and has a lot to offer, being of a different culture herself. A very interesting and worthwhile class. I'm glad it was required for my major!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the nicest teacher ever!!

She encourages discussion, which I really like in a class.  The tests are not too difficult, she gives a study guide and she's always available for extra help.  Slight language barrier at first, but once you get to know her, you don't even notice it. I'd recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2008<br>Class Name: CMN328<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take this class it is horrible. The most boring class I have ever taken. Very hard grader 5 papers 3 pages ea.that are worth 50% of your grade and 2 pain in the @ss tests. The class is the history of rhetoric what a waste of 4 credits</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2005<br>Class Name: CMN328<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If I had more interest in the class, I would have done much better.

Her own experiences have a lot to add, and she has many anecdotes.  She speaks English well, but has a VERY heavy accent.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2003<br>Class Name: CMN275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was awesome!
