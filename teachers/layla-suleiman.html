Very helpful if you catch her during class but don't count on her to respond to your emails. She really cares about her students and what she is teaching, though she is incredibly busy. (I took her at Loyola, she also works for DePaul and the city of chicago) Tests aren't bad, info is directly from power points. overall, good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2011<br>Class Name: SCG610<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Suleiman Gonzales is the business! Very few professors can really teach methods and make it interesting. She is very knowledgeable and interested in helping her students get the most out of the material. She rocks!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/08/2009<br>Class Name: SCG895<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a true educator who cares for her students!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2008<br>Class Name: SCG406<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really enjoyed this class.  Infused theory with interesting discussion, examples, video clips, etc.  Received practical information in addition to theory (ie: 30 minute discussion of adolescent gangs).  Grading is easy if you do the work.  Only complaint: prof is late to class almost every day.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2007<br>Class Name: SCG406<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lots of theories. Kind of confusing explanations.  I always felt she was kind of rushed and never got to fully explain them.  Lots of reading.  Otherwise the class is pretty easy.  She is very knowledgable and very involved with adolescents.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2006<br>Class Name: SCG406<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's super cool and yet she is challenging.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2006<br>Class Name: SCG406<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you have the chance, take this professor.
