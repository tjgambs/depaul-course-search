She takes low level learning domain classes and treats them as major level classes. This class will reflect negatively on your GPA. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2015<br>Class Name: FCH101102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: C+</div><div id="right"><div>I absolutely love her. I took her course about two years ago, and to this day when DePaul students ask me who to take for French I refer them to her. I was one of the students who struggled a lot, but she is very good at recognizing your weaknesses and working to improve them. She will hold your hand thru it but you wont realize it until later. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2014<br>Class Name: FCH101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great professor who takes her work seriously and pushes you to do the same. Brings lots of energy to class. However just be warned that she's not very human--doesn't have compassion for students' struggling. I often noticed her being kind of cruel to students who were having a hard time. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2014<br>Class Name: FCH114<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a wonderful professor and a great French speaker. Take her for FCH113 and you'll probably do better. Be sure to do all homework assignments and show up to class-participation is important. Killer on spelling, grammar, and speaking. The language department has changed since, but overall it's a good class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2014<br>Class Name: FCH101103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm in love with this woman. She only comes across as sarcastic if you legitimately slack off. She figures out students potentials early on and will call you out if you don't work hard - as any excellent professor should.She's the best in the department.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2013<br>Class Name: FCH101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Andre is fantastic. She's tough but that's only because she hates slackers. If you want to learn the language definitely take her class. If it's only for a requirement choose someone else because she'll crush you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2013<br>Class Name: FCH103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had this woman for my Friday classes and couldn't stand her! She did way more criticizing than she did teaching. She ASSumed each student knew the same material even though we all had different professors for 101 and 102. She didn't give any real help until the quarter was almost over. Just don't take French at DePaul unless you really love it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2013<br>Class Name: FCH102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof.Andre is clear, conservative, & structured. However, her sarcasm, assumption of students' struggling = "slacking off," & condescending tone defaces the ideal teacher. Also, her dismissal of effort and creativity in favor of strictness & accuracy is NOT the answer to better pedagogy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2012<br>Class Name: FCH102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's great, very helpful! Definitely helps perfect your French.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2012<br>Class Name: FRNCH102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take French with this woman if you care about your GPA. Yes, she helps in terms of speaking and comprehension skills, but she is so knit-picky that it will ruin your GPA! She gives no partial credit, which was the biggest killer for me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2012<br>Class Name: FCH102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>so much love for this woman. I wouldn't have learned French as well with anyone else but her. Attendance is mandatory and greatly affects your grade, but she allows you makeup sessions. Also, do your homework and pay attention in class - she calls on EVERYONE so if you're not prepared she knows. Work hard and she will appreciate you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2012<br>Class Name: FCH102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Je l'aime. Wonderful woman. Difficult class. Enough said.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2012<br>Class Name: FCH103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Madame Andre! She's very helpful, but she's not for someone who expects an easy A. She makes you work for your grade which is what a great professor does.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2011<br>Class Name: FCH103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's very strict and attendance is mandatory. Participation is expected. She teaches at an extremely fast pace and expects everyone to keep up. If you don't then you fall behind very quickly and have to work even harder to keep up with the class. Do not miss class if you value your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2011<br>Class Name: FCH103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Andre is a wonderful person and should be rewarded for how hard she tries to get students engaged in her class. That being said, this woman scares the life out of me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2011<br>Class Name: FCH103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She expects more out of students than any other professor I've had. Don't take her 8am class because you'll never be awake to actually participate. Otherwise, she's warm and not exactly friendly, but approachable. You can ask her anything you want about class and she'll help you out. Just dont bum around because she'll kill you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2011<br>Class Name: FCH102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely hard. She's sassy too so if you dont know what page we're on in class, or have the wrong answer to a question you'll pay for it. She calls you out on everything in front of the class whether or not you're there. If you slack even for one day she'll hold it against you. She's dedicated for you learning and tries her best. I loved her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2011<br>Class Name: FCH101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Madame Andre taught a little too quickly for beginners. The class itself was very informative and engaging and I learned a lot. Unfortunately, the textbook package was very expensive and could only be purchased the the DePaul bookstore. She uses D2L a lot and has different folders for everything, which can be very confusing at times.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/04/2011<br>Class Name: FCH104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mme. Andre is the best professor I have had at DePaul. She taught me French so well that I now have to test out of the 104 level because my skills from 101-103 were so strong. Do your homework and stay focused in class, it is easy and fun and if you are a good class she will open up more! Love her!!! Take her if you love language!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2011<br>Class Name: FRENC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the best teacher in the Depaul language department for French! Her accent was superb, and I received a wonderful grade in her class! Je l'adore!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2011<br>Class Name: FREN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love her! Great professor; one of the best French-speaking teachers I've ever had. She gives a lot of work because she wants students to grasp the language well. You have to speak  in class to get the audio down, and participation is key. I took 4 years of French in high school from awful teachers who knew nothing compared to Andre. She's great!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2010<br>Class Name: FRENC103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very hard course. I had her for 102 and 103. She has a specific way of teaching and running her class, but once you figure it out, it isn't so bad. If possible, take her for 101, 102 and 103 and you will definitely learn some french. She's always willing to meet outside class for extra help as well. Get on her good side, or you will regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2010<br>Class Name: FCH103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have taken her for two quarters and I def. would like to stick with her. If you don't slack and show improvement you will be rewarded. She's straight to the point and passionate about teaching. She's usually pretty understanding too with assignments. take her! she's not a devil! Just be prepared to  participate.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2009<br>Class Name: FCH103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teachers I've ever had. She takes a geniune interest in each student and his or her learning. She knows what each student struggles with and tries to find ways to help. It isn't an easy class but she will do everything in her power to help you do well. She also gives a lot of easy extra credit points.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2009<br>Class Name: FCH103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a nice lady, but a very tough professor. She really wants her students to succeed and become fluent in French. If you're serious about learning the language - she's great. I recommend her. But if you're just taking it to fulfill a requirement, then maybe you should try an easier language.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2009<br>Class Name: FCH103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Andre is an okay teacher. She's Hatian, so her accent is a bit different than I'm used to, but not a big deal. She lets you email her everything until midnight the day it's due, so no cramming in compositions before class. Sometimes she's unclear, but will always clarify if you ask. I'd recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2009<br>Class Name: FCH102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the meanest teacher I've ever had! Seriously, she is the devil in the flesh! Do not take any class with her, ever!  If she's the only French professor for your course available, seriously, just don't take French.</div></div></div></body></html>
