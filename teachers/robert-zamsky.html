The poets we read include Spencer, Milton, Pope, Keats, Eliot, Pound, and Baraka -- pretty damned good &quot;reps of their eras.&quot;  Z is also HUGELY knowledgeable about his subject.  Really, students embarrass themselves when they pretend to know more than they do.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2006<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely one of the best profs at depaul -- super smart.  Write two explications, which you can revise, a midterm and a final.  He talks about prosody a lot (meter and rhyme, etc.), and reads everything from the Renaissance to contemporary poetry.  He writes about experimental poetry, so that definitely influences his teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2006<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His reading poetry class is great -- he covers tons of material and really encourages you to see poetry in a new light.  Be prepared to read a lot.  His expectations are also pretty high but he's always ready to talk about your papers and will let you rewrite them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2006<br>Class Name: COM104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a really smart guy and is always able to see the other side of an argument.  The class was all discussions and writing papers. Be prepared to write ALOT.. I've had the class for like 7 weeks and have written 8 papers... No tests, finals and midterms are case studies</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2006<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Reading Poetry w/ him. 2 midterm papers, 2 final papers. Although the daily grind was easy, he takes attendance, the poems he chooses are usually poor reps. of their eras, he isn't exceptionally knowledgeable of classic poetry, and he's a fairly tough grader. A nice guy, but boring and moderately tough to get an A in. Proceed w/ caution.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2006<br>Class Name: HON110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Zamsky is great- he knows a ridiculous amount about what he is teaching and is always willing to edit drafts of papers.

I would highly recommend him to anyone!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought I'd written a really awesome paper, then he covered it with criticism, and then I rewrote it into a better paper. I don't know what grade it got because that was my final paper. You should be able to handle criticism! Peer review sessions let me see how other people write; I didn't want to know. Missed class when his daughter was sick.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was a bit boring -- its on research and argument.  but he was great.  He comments on all the papers and tells you what you need to work on.  He really knows his stuff and is very helpful especially if you talk to him one on one.  I will definitely take his poetry class in the fall which I hear is great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an arrogant S.O.B.

His 366 class was great -- we read some hard poetry, but our final papers were on pretty much anything we wanted.  The class was a good balance of lecture, discussion, and small-groups.  A LOT of information, but very interesting.  You will definiely learn something in his classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor.

He is quite brilliant in a way but he's also narrow minded and uninterested in a dialogue that doesn't reinforce his own opinions. I personally liked him but keep in mind that he's not a poet, he's a critic- intelligent but rigid and uninspired.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2006<br>Class Name: ENG220366<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's got sort of a group of followers, and I am one of them. He is an amazing poetry professor...I've taken him twice and have no complaints. He will challenge you to think and write about your opinions, but will never shoot down a new or interesting idea. TAKE HIM IF YOU CAN...you will be inspired.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2005<br>Class Name: ENG219<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgeable and very passionate about teaching.

He is very smart and passionate about his material.  I think some students don't get his style -- he can seem arrogant because he directly challenges conventional expectations.
