Late everyday and she really piles on the work.  You won't learn any Italian but you will constantly be busy doing busywork.  She's the reason I'll never take a language class again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/28/2006<br>Class Name: ITL113<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Marta is such a nice person. She helps you out when you are having difficulty and praises you when you do well. She is a relatively easy professor so you could make little effort and still do well or you can actually learn the choice is up to you. The only thing I will say that can her classes would be improved if she speaks more Italian.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2005<br>Class Name: ITA113<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class, easy work. Show up and be willing to participate and you will get a good grade. If you really want to learn the language, you may want to take someone more strict. She makes class fun and holds a few out of class activities to broaden your cultural experience. There is more to a language than just the words and pronunciations.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2005<br>Class Name: ITA113<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Marta is very nice and I felt comfortable in class. I just wish we could have moved a little faster, but she is really easy and nice. I did not have any problems with her at all, but I would recommend taking Daniela instead because you might learn more.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2004<br>Class Name: ITA<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Marta does not know how to teach.  It was very difficult to follow what she was saying because of her accent.  If you want to learn anything take Gary or Daniela instead.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2004<br>Class Name: ITA111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take this teacher + do your work + show up to class = A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2004<br>Class Name: ITA111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you can memorize well, this professor is for you...i got an A in this class with no effort.

She is really sweet and understanding and clearly loves her job.  She does a great job teaching textbook work as well is giving cultural information.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2004<br>Class Name: ITA112<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Marta is so nice and tries to get the class to have fun, but her class is incredible redundant.  We learn the same thing 20 times in a row.  I learned more in high school language classes.  Very easy grader, not strict on attendance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2004<br>Class Name: ITALIAN<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Marta is the easiest Italian teacher, but also the one you'll learn the least from.  If you're looking to actually learn Italian, don't take her.  If you're just trying to fulfill a requirement, go ahead.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2004<br>Class Name: ITALIAN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No one knows what they are talking aboutif they do not think Marta is a great teacher.

As long as you do your homework and aren't completely dense or disrespectful, you will get an A. Passing the oral exams is so simple it's a joke. Take the night class and you have no practicum. Cestaro is almost Nazi-hard. Take Marta.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2003<br>Class Name: ITA111<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Marta's new and it's noticeable. She's super nice, but scatterbrained. She forgets what she assigned and loses papers frequently. Make copies of everything. Test, etc are straight from the book.</div></div></div></body></html>
