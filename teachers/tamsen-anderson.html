She doesn't read through your work and makes the assumption that one is a poor student and does not know the material. She does not grade the content of the paper. She grades the style of writing. Her expectations are a bit ridiculous and the writing style which she espouses is ugly and plain.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2013<br>Class Name: HAA280<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She "helps you" by reviewing your papers via email, then tells you to change all of it. Wants you to write like a robot with no variation in words. She focuses on how you write the paper rather than the content. She grades so hard it's ridiculous. Exams are unbearably hard. This class ruined my 4.0 gpa if that tells you anything.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2013<br>Class Name: HAA280<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't bother. Seriously. It doesn't matter what you do or how you do it, she'll grade you in a really rough way that doesn't fit the class [it's a 200 level survey after all]. She pretends to help & then smacks you down with totally unfair grades. I'm not meaning to whine, but I'm a very good student & worked very hard to be treated very poorly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2013<br>Class Name: HAA280<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid at all costs. Nice lady and wants to help, but her grading is ridiculous and harsh. She grades in a manner that is degrading to a student and demoralizing. Her expectations exceed her peers' and she is caught up in herself. She is a great teacher in the classroom, but she's highly inappropriate in her grading. I'm no idiot and I received a B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2011<br>Class Name: HAA377<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She definitely knows her stuff!

As for the mid-term/final you must memorize about 12 pieces from art history which can be daunting task for some.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2011<br>Class Name: ART666<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Talks too much.

It's difficult, but she's awesome. You have to memorize a lot, but it's definitely manageable if you study & she tells you exactly what you need to know for the test. She's very picky about the paper, but she's so helpful & will edit your drafts. She's strict, but funny & knows everything about art history</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2011<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm in her class right now (this quarter) and I have really enjoyed it.

She's clear, concise,& she knows what she's talking about. Is she tough&#63; Uhm, yeah&#63; But this is DePaul, not some 2nd rate public university & therefore she should rightfully expect the best from us. I got an A because I studied, worked hard, & I'm more than capable of writing clearly & effectively.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2011<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have no idea what the people are complaining about! This woman is passionate, intelligent, & she KNOWS HER STUFF! Art History is NOT a required course @ DePaul & if you're not a major in the discipline, DON'T TAKE THE CLASS! Dr. Anderson is wonderful, insightful, direct, and clear as a bell. If you actually WANT to learn, PLEASE take her class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2011<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The most arrogant teacher I've ever experienced.  Her lectures are full of dull and useless information that is frequently irrelevant to art history.  You're expected to memorize dates and styles, while completely ignoring political or social interactions of the era.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2010<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have a feeling some of the people rating her are just a wee bit bitter. She's a really nice person and she's ridiculously clear about what she expects. Her lectures are thorough and interesting and she literally tells you everything you need to know. Tough class though.

She failed me. She teaches the class like it's a graduate class. I think I missed one day and I even went to see her for extra help on several occastion.  Horrible grader!

If you write beautifully, with lots of language and detail, don't bother taking her class. She wants you to write like you are writing a machine manual. I thought it was an Art History class and not a Graduate level writing class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/29/2010<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extreamly picky grader but she is willing to spend 2hrs helping you so not unreasonable. Learned A LOT & got more out of her class then any other. I respect her a lot and she pretty much tells you what she expects. You need to study very hard but if you can't pull a B in her class then you don't belong in college anyway.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2010<br>Class Name: HAA300<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TERRIBLE! I attended all the classes participated every day and still got a D! If you are a free thinking, more artsey and less history DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS, I could not fit into her little box she wanted all of her students to be in! everything she wanted was ridiculous!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2010<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a total nazi.

She practically outlines your comparison paper with such detail that you only have to add some words. This said this is where she gets merit for being picky; she goes out of her way to tell you what she wants.Hard but definitely worth taking just take notes (tells you what to write/not)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2010<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE, WORST EVER, MUST BE MASTER WRITER READY TO PRESENT YOUR RESEARCH OR YOU GET AN F</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/21/2010<br>Class Name: HAA100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Anderson is a great teacher and is ready and willing to help her students with any problem.

One factual error on a paper and you get a C. Also, there are only three grades so if you do poorly on the midterm and her idiotic paper you probably WON'T pass the class.

She spelled out EVERYTHING that she wanted on the tests and paper, and I didn't have to do any work at all.  Barely studied, did the paper the night before it was due - and still got an easy A.

I thought the lectures would get boring, but they never did! She is so clear on her expectations that it is nearly impossible to fail anything in this class.

She truly wants the student to gain an understanding and knowledge about art history.  For Pre Modern Architecture she supplied handouts with vocabulary, images, names, dates, etc.  Her expectations are high, but she wants you to learn and succeed.  Feedback on exams/papers are in-depth and helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2008<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredibly intelligent and well spoken professor! Take this class if you truly enjoy learning. She expects a lot from her students, but is very clear about assignments/exams. She is extremely helpful and organized.

Sticks to attendance policy, willing to help her students.  tells you at the first class what she expects and why not to take the class. only four grades (midterm, final and two papers)  Grades the papers pretty hard, I was four lines short of three pages and she dropped my grade down</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/17/2007<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cold.  Very cold.  She knows what shes talking about but I don't think I ever saw her smile.  Everything is very organized and all of the information is presented very clearly, but I think she lost her soul many years ago.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2007<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved her and her class. On the first day she gives her students every reason why not to take her class, but it is worth it to stick with her if you have any interest at all in art history. She's reliable and clear about what she expects from her students, and that may be too much for some people. There are 2 3-page essays and two big tests-not bad</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2007<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is a great teacher and really knows her stuff, you will get a lot out of her class even if you dont like art.

While the class is very interesting and I thought she did a good job of teaching, I very much dislike her stlye of grading, and exams.

Secondly, Tamsen does NOT know her stuff... We constantly corrected her and she only acknowledged about half of her mistakes...

Oh yes, and this is coming from a student who got an A in her class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I Love her!! She is the best professor in Depaul and if I could take her in ever quarter I would. Sorry to those that don't like going to class but if you go to class and take notes you'll get a really good grade. She clearly loves what she does and really cares about her students. If you talk to her about your problems with class she'll help you!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2006<br>Class Name: HST<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class has a lot of info..but she is very helpful</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2006<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She grades very harshly on papers.

Has the best office hours ever at DePaul, and stays true to her word. Well there is 1 MT, 1 Final and two papers. She dropped 1 paper though.
