She is incredibly passive aggressive, rude, and talks to the whole classroom as if we were in pre-k. She thinks she's funny but she just makes it uncomfortable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2015<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>The readings felt pretty irrelevant. A lot of outside research was expected for the papers, and she always graded very specific and odd aspects of the papers. Not necessarily a super harsh grader (though this class did ruin my 4.0). Seems very condescending when talking to students, and I had a hard time developing any interest in the lectures. </div></div></div></body></html>
