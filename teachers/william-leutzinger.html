Class was pretty fun to go to, and it particularly focuses on the business side of telecommunications (not saying there isn't any theory involved, because there is). Quizzes are open notes and the final is take home. Also you have to do a presentation on a topic of your choice with certain specifications. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2014<br>Class Name: TDC364<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredible professor.  The spectacular part about Bill is that you actually learn an absurd amount in this class without even realizing it.  He is working in the field, incredibly knowledgeable and explains everything perfectly.    Quizzes are open note and final is take home. This class is a must take.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2012<br>Class Name: TDC464<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bill is a really cool laid back, relaxed kind of guy. His quizzes are open notes (so write what he says in the lecture to get an "A" on the quizzes). He brings in speakers to give you a viewpoint of the "real world". There are no breaks but lets you out early. His midterm is easy if you study the study guide and the final is take-home. Take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2011<br>Class Name: TDC460<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you really want to learn something about communication take him.He is very easy going just submit his assignments on time.
