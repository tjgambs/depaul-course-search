You have to study very, VERY hard.  Multiple choice exams but still, HARD!! She definitely knows her stuff though.  No homework BUT study!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2005<br>Class Name: BIOLOGY103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she was by far the worst teacher I've ever had.  she was the sole reason why I got out of biology and changed majors.  She completely ruined the entire subject for me forever.  Totally unclear, doesn't specify what she wants you to study, unfair grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2005<br>Class Name: BIO<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2005<br>Class Name: BIO224<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tooons of information is given is the short span of just one quarter.  She is nice, but do not take this class if you don't want to do a lot of work.  Because this class requires A LOT of work! Tests are extremely hard (whether you study or not)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2005<br>Class Name: BIO103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2005<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Quinn really knows her stuff and teaches very well and expects students to take the class seriously. Quizes every week are not bad but tests are tough. I learned a lot in her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2004<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take Bio if you're looking for a blow-off class, but Dr. Quinn does a great job explaining the material. She's really nice and grades fairly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2004<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a pretty good teacher. All her lectures are on PowerPoint, but don't let that fool you. You actually do apply what you learn in lecture during lab. Her tests aren't too bad if you study and pay attention in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2004<br>Class Name: BIO102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A good teacher but I hated the lectures. Straightforward, but at times condescending. Other than that, a good prof if you like powerpoint presentations. Tests are hard, so study study study.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/15/2004<br>Class Name: BIO103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr Quinn covers alot, but if you prepare, you are fine.  I got a B with a good amount of studying, but not over the top.  She tells you what to study, and then that stuff is on the exams.  Just get your stuff done and you will do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/30/2004<br>Class Name: BIO239<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I definitely recommend this professor.  She's very organized and lets you know exactly what will be on the exams.  While her tests are dificult, if you study, you will do fine.  She's great at getting the material across.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2004<br>Class Name: BIO103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I must say, I have trouble staying awake, even I heard when Dr. Quinn said what was going to be on the exam! Powerpoint, the notes are right in front of you, not hard to study, she explains everything, answers questions, and knows her stuff.take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2004<br>Class Name: BIO103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She goes through material very quickly. It's hard to keep up and remember and understand every detail. The tests are hard. The class average for one exam was low. There is so much information given and there are so many classifications/taxonomy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2004<br>Class Name: BIO103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has a lot of info in a short quarter, hard to understand and keep up with it all. Test are really hard. Multiple choice, essay, and fill in the blank. i suggest you get another teacher cause most of my class was failing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2004<br>Class Name: BIO239<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class. She's easy to listen to, but be sure to study for tests, especially the lab practical. And she looks exactly like the actress on Alias... I have a sneaking suspicion that she's actually a secret agent of ST6 using the &quot;professor&quot; ac</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2004<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. made everything really interesting, never a dull moment. gives real life examples.  test were straight to the point and was even better cus she told you exactly what is going to be on them. great teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2004<br>Class Name: BIO224<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher and very easy to understand. She's a hard grader and tests are very tricky!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2004<br>Class Name: INTROBIO<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an excellent teacher. She is very specific and gets right to the point. She always makes lectures interesting and easy to understand. Also, she always responds to email the next day and posts all lectures on blackboard before class.Great teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2004<br>Class Name: BIO115<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked this teacher.  She let us out of class early each day.  It was a powerpoint lecture everytime.  Super clear, and easy if you pay attention.  However, study for tests, because you cannot just wing it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2004<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she wasnt teaching bio 101 but helped during labs. i hate anything that has to do with science but she made things very clear to me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2004<br>Class Name: BIO100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher was terrible all she did was give lectures and talk the whole time. She never mentioned what the final or the midterm was about and all she did was talk! I would not recomend her at all she needs to give her students more information.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2004<br>Class Name: BIO115<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an awesome teacher that I would definately recommend!  Her lectures are absolutely awesome and she doesn't play games.  She will tell you exactly what you need to know for her exams, which are all True/False and multiple choice.  One of my faves!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2003<br>Class Name: BIOLAB<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Exceptional teacher and all around great person.  Knows her stuff, and gives great 'clincal' applications to her teachings!  Hope she stays all four years!</div></div></div></body></html>
