He tells you what will be on the quizzes and exams. No homework and you don't need the book. Offers lots of extra credit, and you get up to 6 points of extra credit on the exam just for having good attendance. Lots of energy, not a difficult class with this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2015<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Jin Choi doesn't have the skills necessary to be an effective teacher.  While he is knowledgeable about Statistics, that knowledge is not easily transferred.  He will overexplain fairly straightforward topics, but flies through actual problems with little explanation.  Also, his book is a required text (conflict?) and is written like he teaches.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2015<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Choi is awesome! His lectures were clear & he tries to keep it fun. Attendance counts as extra credit toward your exam grades. The weekly quizzes were pretty easy to get 100s on when you study your notes & the outlines he has online. He also posts practice questions for each chapter that help with studying for the tests & quizzes. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2015<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Choi is there for his students. Go to class, pay attention, study a bit on the side and you will do fine. He genuinely wants to prepare his students for the business world. He forces you to stay on top of the material by giving you ten question quizzes every week. Doing well on the quizzes will allow you to do well on the three tests. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2015<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Choi is a really good professor. He's funny and even though the lectures are long he helps get you through it. His quizzes can be tough but the tests aren't too bad. I'd take him again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2015<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Choi is THE BEST professor I have ever taken. He is very clear and makes the class easy to follow. Takes his time to go through each chapter making sure that the class understands the material. There is alot of extra credit on for every quiz, midterm and final. He even gives extra credit for attendance! Very smart with great credentials!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2014<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Moves very quickly through things. You need to stay caught up each week to do well. Definitely will show you any areas of stats that you might be rusty in.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2014<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr Choi is a good professor and a good person who helps his students.  This course requires a lot of work and dedication, but if you work hard an A is very attainable.  A lot of effort will be required if you do not have a strong background in calculus, statistics and high level math skills. All in all a tough, but fair class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2014<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Intense course that you will have to work hard to do well in.  Listen to his advice on how to do well: 1. Read the book & do the examples.  2. Listen to the lecture and solve the examples presented in it.  3. Do the homework. He cares and wants you to learn.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The material itself isn't easy, but he does a great job preparing you for his exams and lets you know when you expect a quiz. He provides an outline of what he'll cover in class and does a great job in explaining tough topics. Attendance is mandatory. I went to all classes, studied for the 3 exams, and reviewed notes before quizzes and got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2013<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is definitely the weed-out for the MBA program. Horror stories abound. Take Choi's online class and join a study group. You'll actually understand the concepts and be able to use them. This isn'y an easy course by any stretch, but he's the best professor to take.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2013<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wouldn't recommend, tough grader and he moves through material so ridiculously fast. Tough quizzes without notice and the class average was a 72%. I would take someone else for, what should be, an easy business core class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2013<br>Class Name: GSB400<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought Professor Choi was extremely reasonable and helpful for the numerous topics we covered in the class. It's a class for students who aren't familiar with basic calculus and statistics and while we moved at a very fast pace, we covered a lot of material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2013<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not an easy class, but the prof is very helpful and explains the material well.  I read some of the comments and wanted to add that there is nothing wrong with his English - I understood everything just fine.  He tries to help students as much as he can and jokes a lot to lighten up the mood.  I would take a class with him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2013<br>Class Name: ECON315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Choi is one of the best teachers I've had at DePaul. He is very clear when he explains things, and he lets you know what will be on the exams. The questioning on the exam can make you second-guess yourself, but if you study, you'll do well. He ties what he teaches into everyday life, and the class was extremely helpful. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Highly Recommend! I am in the online section which consists of weekly online homework from his book (30%), Midterm (35%), and Final (35%). Both exams are take-home and you have three days to complete them. He has videos to explain each chapter on D2L. He is really helpful if you have any questions, give you everything you need to succeed in class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2013<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The textbook and the professor's words are very inconsistant (and he wrote the textbook).

Jin Choi does not speak english well which made a hard class impossible. Tough grader and doesnt connect well with students.I took an online class and our class avg was a 74%, no curve. Dont ruin your GPA, Take with someone else!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2013<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I found professor Choi to be a great instructor! yes, at times the way he words the questions are hard to interpret, but he does a great job with the material (which is not an exciting topic). I took the online version of the class, HW due online every week, midterm and a final. the class is easy if you keep up w/the material. Highly recommend him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2013<br>Class Name: ECON315<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tells you what is on the tests if you pay attention. The way he words tests are a little tricky, but if you study you will get a good grade. 3 test and quizzes every week.

Do not take this man for GSP 420. He cheated students out of grades and failed many students in my class, making then re-take it. Not helpful and pretty offensive. STAY AWAY FROM JIN CHOI</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2013<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Annoying professor. He has such a big ego. Talks for hours about grades, tests, impossible to locate him outside of class.

Weekly quizzes, 3 tests. No textbook necessary. Come to class so you can earn extra credit. He has outline for each chapter so you can take notes during class. Tests are no surprises. A great man to get advice from!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2012<br>Class Name: ECON315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What I really like about this professor is that he relates everything to the present. No txtbook required.

Not only is Choi extremely responsive through email, but he wants you to "get it," and will explain things in such a manner where it is almost fun and easy. Work in a group on hmwks and ull be set!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2012<br>Class Name: ECON315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Choi is a baller. Extra credit questions on the test and your attendance is extra credit as well. 3 exams, no midterm, no final, but weekly "pop" quizzes, in which he warns you when they will be and when they are. You don't need the book and this is an easy class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2012<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved him, tests were super easy and he asks for feedback after you get them back, come to class and you get extra credit on the exams, pretty much impossible to fail his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2012<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2011<br>Class Name: QUANT450<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This prof clearly states what he expects of his students. If you meet those expectations you will survive.     The lecture is excellent, the video is a great back-up resource and he has some of the best problems to solve.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/11/2011<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want to be treated like a child take him. Don't listen to what he says in class about attendance. Show up to each class, study on your own. If you want to bump your grade, threaten a grade challenge and it will happen. Don't ask for what you earned, or he'll claim that it was a &quot;mistake&quot; even if he did it to more than 1 student.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/10/2011<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He teaches so clearly that you will understand the concepts very well. His exams are little tricky, but if you do all the homework and read the text book, you can easily get A. I highly recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2011<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall good prof., clear explanation in class, eager to answer questions. There is homework due every week, but it's fairly easy if you pay attention in class. His jokes are a bit goofy, but it helps make the dry material more bearable :-)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2010<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's just like every other Econ teacher at DePaul, and uses solely a PowerPoint. Oh, but he'll lie to you about the attendance policy. FYI, it's mandatory. And he has no email etiquette.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2010<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is a great professor I highly recommend taking him for he is very helpful and quite funny.

His test are very very tricky though. The material comes more easily for accounting/finance majors than it does for marketing. Gives EC for attendance which is a great incentive for coming to class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2010<br>Class Name: ECON315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor! Extra credit for attendance (up to 6 per test) plus up to three extra questions on the tests (each worth 2points). Class average on the second test was 80 so I don't know why people complain so much. I studied his notes only and received 103 on the last exam. He wants you to do well!!! take him!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2010<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice person who tries his best to have students get the lesson. Very responsive to questions. The tests are somewhat hard and requires heavy studying but he grades fairly which is good. The killer is the book he authored which is not that good and has too many holes for improvement.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2010<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Choi is great.  Don't try to pull anyting funny with this guy because his is firm on his policy.  He gives out extra credit and honestly wants to see his students succeed.

Take this class!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2010<br>Class Name: ECO325<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Choi is AMAZING!! I have never had a teacher who has cared more about his students and their success. This is not a blow off class, you must study. But his notes are all you need. Study those and you will get an A.

He told our class he needed a pepper on ratemyprofessor to show his wife...so there you go Dr. Choi!  Do not bother buying the book.  His fantastic notes are all you need.

He prepares lecture notes but they are unclear, and often you must memorize exact words.  Focuses on little details and not the main concepts.

He wrote the book for this course, and it literally takes you step by step (as the title infers) through the concepts.  Those who say he is not good either didn't put forth enough effort, or just didn't understand the material.  I recommend Choi.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2009<br>Class Name: ECON315<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>confusing style of teaching. the best thing to do is study his notes that he puts up on line. textbook is useless.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2009<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Go to class and do the homework and you'll be OK.  The topic (stats) isn't too relevant for most people in the class, but good knowledge to have.  I think most people dislike the subject not prof. Choi.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2009<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took the online version of this course and found it challenging, but worthwhile. As long as you finish the homework you should be fine. The midterm and final are take home and you get three days to complete them. They were both pretty hard, but he curved when necessary. Overall I enjoyed this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Expect a lot of humor (or attempts), tangential discussion, and very difficult final.  Quizzes and homeworks were tough, but easy to do well because they are take home and you can collaborate with classmates.  The final was very difficult and he grades on a straight scale, which can really hurt.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Let's be clear: there is is no good teacher of this course. There is only sucks & OMFG sucks. Choi wrote the book, which is useless & full of arcane math problems that do not advance understanding. He has a tendency to ask subjective questions on his homework. If DePaul wants to make this a mandatory couse, they could invest in actual TEACHERS!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's funny and knows the subject. Some people were frustrated with his communication skills. But, if they would have just asked questions, they would have gotten answers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Midterm and final plus opportunity for lots of points through homework.  The book is confusing and not helpful.  Professor is a good guy and at times when he walks through concepts and reviews what you've already learned he is helpful.  But, he provides slides/notes for each chapter and sometimes just goes through them and doesn't teach concepts.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Choi was great.  I took this as a distance learning class but he stil was around whenever I needed help.  His expectations are very clear and his syllabus and homework is fair.  The difficulty of the class all depends on what kind of a math background you have.  The final exam was somewhat difficult.  As others have said, he grades fairly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Choi is funny and light hearted.

It's pretty much a math class, with the difficulty level dependent on your background.  He's surprisingly laid-back and makes a real attempt to help you.  He's a fair grader as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class online, so studying was at my own pace.  The video lectures were helpful, but sometimes hard to understand.  Dr. Choi uses a lot of Power Points to supplement the textbook.  Homework is difficult, but manageable.  Final was extremely difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2007<br>Class Name: ECON315<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor, cares about what you think.  He is well-organized and lets you know what to expect before the course begins.  3 Exams only,pay attention in class,review notes and asks questions then you should be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My section was distance-learning the first half, then in-class the second half.  This is pretty much a math class, and Choi put forth a lot of effort to help the students.  He's also a fair grader.  The class has a lot of homework though and is pretty time-consuming.  The work is moderately difficult but that depends on your background.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The HW was extremely time consuming but manageable, but the final exam was by far the hardest exam I've ever had, and he gives very little direction other than &quot;learn everything in the book.&quot; Doesn't give extra credit & doesn't grade on a curve. Avoid this class and the professor altogether. If You must take it do not take this on-line!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2006<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>EXCELLENT Teacher!
