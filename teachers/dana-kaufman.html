Every class, there is a reading due, and some are very lengthy and difficult. Other than that, there are 3 quizzes and 2 written assignments in class based on the readings. If you read, you'll do good on the quizzes. She usually let us out early. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2015<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is not easy, and she will tell you that on the first day. Look somewhere else if you want an easy A. Besides that, I genuinely enjoyed listening to her lectures, Dana knows what she is talking about and that's clear. She keeps the class interesting, and the assignments are not bad at all. Make sure to study.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2015<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her for Intro to Mass Comm. She teaches the class from a law based perspective. Her assignments are very unclear, but if you want her help you have to go out of your way to get it - it's her way or the highway. She doesn't like answering questions over email, but designates time when you can ask for help. Do the readings, and you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2015<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Dana was a fun teacher. She is a fair grader but her quizzestests are tough so make sure to study up! Would definitely recommend taking her. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2015<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I wished someone had told me not to  take her class. The only good thing is you don't have to buy the textbook. Didn't learn much about mass communication. She won't clarify assignments and won't answer any questions you have. She is also a pretty tough grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/14/2015<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Expert in her field. I really, REALLY liked this class. It is not an Easy-A, you definitely have to work for it, but she gives you days just to ask questions. She doesn't post power points, so bring a laptop and take notes. She is funny and has so many examples to help you understand the material. AWESOME. Didn't use the book, lots of PDF readings</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2014<br>Class Name: COMM102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is amazing! Super helpful and understanding. There are a few quizzes throughout the quarter, but if you read you will be perfectly fine. It is all awesome material and interesting. She does not post power points, but gives us time to write everything. Sad she only teaches Comm102 now.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2013<br>Class Name: COM102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's tough- but so intelligent and knows what she's talking about. If you're not motivated she won't bother with you, but as soon as you make a visible effort she will appreciate it. Hard and honest grader</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2013<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She talks fast and won't give powerpoints out so it's important to be in class. She is a nice and knowledgeable lady but you really have to keep up with all the assignments or else you'll struggle. I liked her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2012<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dana was intimidating at first as some of the other reviews said -- but she was a great professor! She is very clear on what is expected and what she wants from you. You HAVE to read the readings provided! Midterm and Final are pretty easy essays. Loved this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2012<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dana is an awesome professor! I was a little intimidated at first but she knows what she's talking about and doesn't rely on multiple choice tests. The quizzes and papers are reasonable and she's a really loveable person. Take her for this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2012<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dana was absolutely amazing. She was very clear on what she expected, kept things interesting and always responded quickly to emails. You don't need the textbooks, but do know that there are a lot of articles you HAVE to read. Do the reading, though, and you will be perfectly fine in her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2012<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Highly recommended! She is VERY knowledgeable about this subject, her lectures are never boring, and she doesn't give multiple-choice tests. The class includes three short-answer quizzes, two short essay tests, and two formal essays. All of the quizzes and written assignments are basically just tests of whether you understood the assigned reading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2012<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was the greatest class I have ever taken. Professor Kaufman is incredible knowledgeable! You will learn so much from her. She speeds through lectures, so make sure to take notes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2012<br>Class Name: COM102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I regret not reviewing Dana right away after last quarter - PHENOMENAL: Fair, fun, and one of the best-educated profs I've had in three years. Read the material and GO TO CLASS - lecture heavy. Dana makes a 3-hour night jumbo feel like 90 minutes. ABSOLUTELY RECOMMENDED.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2011<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy if you come to class, but attendance not mandatory. Does not post anything on d2l, so bring a computer to class to take notes because she lectures 100 miles an hour with little regard for the students taking notes (TAKE THEM!). She lacks compassion and does not help students. But if you pay attention, attend and read you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2011<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She will change ur idea of what a college class should be: no lame lectures off a powerpoint! She knows the info for herself and doesnt give you the textbook version. She tells it like it is- so interesting! Easy A- come to class & read articles- no txtbk.6 quizzes- drops the lowest grade. 1 paper and take home final! A must for a CMN/PR/ADV major!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2011<br>Class Name: MSC230<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. knows her stuff however it is not taught thoroughly. Rambles stuff on the board and repeats herself alot, in lecture and powerpoints(not good).She is a chill person but kind of a tough grader seeing that she expects much more than what she actually asks you to answer on her assignment sheets. If its not necessary to take her class, don't.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2009<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What an intelligent person.  I wanted the lectures to go on and on.  You NEED to read and NEED to come to class, but if you do, it shouldn't be that hard.  She expects a lot from you and if you bring it, it will be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/02/2008<br>Class Name: CMN110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has a thorough knowledge on the topics in the class. While she may be a bit cynical, I enjoyed her lectures.  She also combines her lectures with quite a lot of media. Do NOT, however, think you can get by without paying attention to the lectures or the media she presents. No chance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2008<br>Class Name: FILM101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is one of the brightest, sharpest profs I've had. Definitely knows her stuff and doesn't put up w/ students' BS - which is way better than the opposite. I loved her class. I'm sure the negative comments are from people who can't deal with straight talk and accountability.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2008<br>Class Name: CMN110<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just do yourself a favor and take another professor. Simply not worth the aggravation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2008<br>Class Name: ART179<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best class ever. No text book required. She gives all the reading that she's testing from. Each class has a quiz based on the reading. Class is fun, and teacher tells all that has to be done to get an A.  Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: CMN110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I disagree with many of the below comments. I thought Professor Kaufman was a good teacher. She was very clear in her expectations and a fair grader. Her class was not difficult and I thought she was funny. I would definitely take her class again...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2008<br>Class Name: CMN110<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I posted the last string - it was 110 not 101 - my bad!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2007<br>Class Name: CMN110<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She says that attendance is not mandatory, but I would really recommend going.  The quizzes are easy as long as you read the material.  Her lectures are sometimes hard to follow.  The course material was really interesting, and we watched a ton of movies most of the time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2007<br>Class Name: CMN110<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>really intresting info! half the class we watched movies which were actually entertaining.

She did seem unavailable due to her busy schedule but she has an appreciation for nice weather and cancels class accordingly. The subject is interesting if you are in the right field...if you don't like film you obviously shouldn't take the class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2006<br>Class Name: CMN110<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No respect for students. Totally apparent that she would rather be doing anything but teach. Watch out for her class policy - she appears lenient at first b/c she has no attendance, but won't allow makeups for ANYTHING, even if they are documented medical reasons. Picks class favorites early on. I would never, ever recommed her to someone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2006<br>Class Name: CMN110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pro. Kaufmann has an interesting class, she likes input from other students as well. I believe she is very busy outside of class so if you have ques. try and ask someone else. Do the readings, show up on quiz days and take some time to put together a good paper your ok. A lot of people have some mean things to say but you'll be fine :) promise</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2006<br>Class Name: CMN110<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She seriously is not that bad. She comes off as a hard teacher in the beginning but by the end of the quarter she lets you out early. If you go to class and participate then she likes you and you'll get a good grade. Her quizzes arent that hard as long as you do the reading and she lets you drop the lowest one. Final is a take home essay.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2006<br>Class Name: CMN110<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is not half as bad as the other comments make her seem. Shes stuck up and thinks shes the sh*t, but just read the material and its an easy A. Sometimes she talks fast but half the information isnt important anyways. I would take another class with her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2006<br>Class Name: CMN375<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A real graceful one, Dana Kaufman.  She is the most condescending teacher I've ever had.  The class is interesting, but if you're not blown away first by her 1995 style, you will be by her arrogance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: ART379<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At first I thought class would be a blast because Kaufman seems quirky and interesting. However, a couple weeks into the quarter, I was totally turned off. Not helpful, professional, or even very smart... Kinda want my $$ back. Don't let her waste your time- avoid class with her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2006<br>Class Name: CMN271<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stay away honestly!Very unorganized, rude and downright unhelpful.Last quarter I asked her if she could return my final, she replied &quot; Won't be in the office til next year.&quot; Real ****. Also when we filled out the teacher evals last quarter she brought them to the office herself.Professors are not supposed to touch these,a real class act she is :(</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2005<br>Class Name: CMN271<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ok i'd say she's a definite bluffer...she likes to make her class sound like the hardest class at depaul, and that she WILL fail you (she mentioned that almost every class)...yeah,if you do the work you'll be fine and she likes hard workers,but she bluffs her *****iness like no other! kinda aggravating,not gonna lie...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2005<br>Class Name: CMN271<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm not gonna say she's a *****, but she is way overconfident, considering SHE DOESNT EVEN HAVE A phD!!!  She literally said at one point &quot;I know so much about film, it's sick&quot; and meant it.  Come on.   She's one of those people that likes to grade poorly to prove that she knows more than you (in the shallowest way possible)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2005<br>Class Name: CMN<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought she was great. She lets you skip class most of the semester. The discussions were interesting and as long as you read and do what she says... which is not that hard, you will def get an A!

Straight to the point, no nonsense, and really knows her stuff. Made class really interesting, and used great examples to get the material across.  Would take another class from her in a second.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2004<br>Class Name: CMN346<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVE HER LOVE HER LOVE HER  Definitely from the North Shore--reflects on the way she thinks and all.

I absolutely love Dana. She is extremely knowledgable about the subject matter and very interesting. Her exams are tough, but if you go to class and take good notes you'll get an A. She's great!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2004<br>Class Name: CMN346<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2004<br>Class Name: CMN346<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doesnt know what the hell she is talking about!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2004<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2004<br>Class Name: CMN346<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not as bad as everyone makes her out to be.
