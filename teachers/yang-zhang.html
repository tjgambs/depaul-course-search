After getting used to it, the class wasn't that bad. He is thorough in his explanations and helps you if you ask. Attendance is not mandatory but go or you'll fall behind.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2008<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nearly impossible to understand but he writes everything clearly on the board. His quizzes and midterm are too easy and his final ends up being way too hard. This class was a breeze except for the final which was weighted 40%. He allows notes. Extremely nice and understanding. Would recommend. But beware of the final!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2008<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really easy class, attendance not mandatory.

You can't understand a word he says, and he can't understand a word you say. Unless you already know the material, you will not pass this class. Even the easy material he made impossible. Take Denis Miller instead!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2008<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>take this class. He is a fair grader and gives extra credit. He cares that his students understand the material.

Even if you know nothing about calculus you will do good.  The class is basically designed for you to get an A. The night class gets a little frustrating at times because you cannot understand a thing he says. But don't worry about that because he writes everything he says.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2008<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing teacher.
