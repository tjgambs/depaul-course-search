Quizzes are not reasonable and are designed to trick students rather than test them.  He has a grader who has done a poor job, both incorrect and slow grading.  His slides and sample code are helpful.  He means well and I enjoyed the class, but there are improvements to be made.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2015<br>Class Name: 300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Good luck.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2015<br>Class Name: CSC471<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>2nd class with him.  He's perfectly fine in weekly classes.  Good luck getting a hold of him outside of that.  I sent exactly 3 messages about serious class topics (detailed issues I was having with an app, a quiz being graded incorrectly) which he never felt the need to answer.  Paying 3K per class, I should not need to beg you to listen to me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2015<br>Class Name: SE433<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Really not crazy about this guy, he mostly reads slides and his lectures are extremely boring.  His tests are difficult and he doesn't put enough emphasis on that which he tests on.  Most homework assignments are not very helpful with regard to the testing material.  The textbox is nearly useless and is not an easy read either.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2014<br>Class Name: CSC403<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The final exam was a complete nightmare.  He tests on material only vaguely related to what we spent hours going over.  Teaches you one thing, then exams you on something else, and then wonders why he has to curve it because everyone failed.  I learned a decent amount from the class but the exam was COMPLETELY absurd.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2014<br>Class Name: CSC403<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely horrible. Made class extremely hard. Class averaged 60% on quizzes. It was not yet an awful class until the exam. It was almost 20 pages. There was nothing in lecture/quizzes that prepared us for many of the questions. I took tons of notes that ended up being  useless. He is average as a teacher and truly horrible as an exam maker.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2014<br>Class Name: CS403<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is organized, passionate, and cares about his students. The only downside (which could be an upside) is that he just lectures and there is little class participation. He follows the textbook to the T, but he makes things very clear. The topics that he talked about were asked on my latest interview. I would take another class with him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/21/2013<br>Class Name: CSC403<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Data Structures. One of the worst classes I've had in my life. Lecture often didn't prepare us for the homework. The final was a disaster. No one finished it. I think uncurved, the majority of the class failed it. Wish I had saved my money and slogged through the Sedgewick book on my own, since that's what class amounted to. Nice guy, awful class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2013<br>Class Name: CSC402<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Watch out for this professors tests.  If it is a Java course you have him for, his tests will be fully focused on Java code and none of the concepts or definitions that are being taught in the class.  Reading the book isn't going to help you, but understanding the concepts he is teaching in the lecture and applying it to advanced Java programming.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2012<br>Class Name: SE433<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't like his old school teaching style. Not cooperative and you have to do the majority of the work by yourself. I can just get the book and struggle though it all by myself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2012<br>Class Name: SE433<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor. Explains everything in a very simple and coherent manner. Knows what he's talking about and is very fair when it comes to grading. I can safely say I learnt quite a bit from this class and the assignments he gives prepare you for real world scenarios. Looking forward to taking his Agile Development class next semester.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2011<br>Class Name: CSC433<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Constantly extends the dates for assignments which is cool when you're 18 but when you're an adult, working full time, and taking grad classes at night, you expect a real world schedule that doesn't benefit the lazy, it's maddening. If grad school is your bridge to the professional world, his assignments bridge away.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2011<br>Class Name: SE433<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jia is a top notch professor at DePaul and you can tell he has a lot of passion for software engineering. He tends to side track a lot and has fairly high expectations for students to learn on their own. This class is half coding half written assignments. Barely touches the surface of unit testing. Lots of discussion on theoretical principles.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/14/2008<br>Class Name: SE425<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Also SE431</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/01/2006<br>Class Name: SE452<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. My only problem was I already knew a lot of the material--despite that he kept it interesting and made learning the stuff I didn't know fairly simple. Other students seemed to like the class as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2005<br>Class Name: SE491<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>friendly, smart</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2003<br>Class Name: JAVA<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>wonderful teacher, great communication, very thorough exams, learned a great deal.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2002<br>Class Name: SE452<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Explains concepts very clearly</div></div></div></body></html>
