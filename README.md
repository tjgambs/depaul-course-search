# depaul-course-seach

The DePaul Course Seach website is meant to help DePaul students prepare their course selections for the coming quarter. 
This website provides an easy to navigate interface while giving the student more information about all classes and their
corresponding professors. This website has ratemyprofessor integrated which makes it so useful. Students are able to sort
the tables ascending or descending by clicking on the headers. Students can also sort multiple columns by holding down the
shift button then clicking multiple headers. Enjoy :)
