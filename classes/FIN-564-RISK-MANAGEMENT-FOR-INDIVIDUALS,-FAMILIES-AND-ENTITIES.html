The course starts with insurance markets and insurance products.  After the discussion on insurance as a risk management tool, the discussion shifts to topics in financial risk management, including risk tolerance and asset allocation in a mean-variance framework.  The remainder of the course adopts an integrative framework for managing other risk factors; such as those generated by uncertain earnings, mortality and longevity - that are not present in an institutional investment setting and discusses the role of financial risk management and insurance products for hedging those risk factors.  At the level of the individual, the course views total wealth as a combination of financial assets and human capital and develops portfolio allocations and strategies for risk management accordingly.  For families and entities, the focus is on asset-liability management as a tool for portfolio allocation and risk management.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/thomas-edwalds.html">3.6</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>25204</td><td><a href = "../teachers/thomas-edwalds.html">Thomas</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/thomas-edwalds.html">Edwalds</a></td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>201</td><td>25204</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Tuesday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
