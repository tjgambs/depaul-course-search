Lectures and class discussions will address how modern art, often oppositional and contradictory in nature, responds to, reflects, or builds on the effects of modernization (i.e. urbanization, industrialization, and global capitalism). Modern art objects will be read for both stylistic innovation and for connections to, and commentaries on, specific historical developments. Significant themes to be addressed include the character and history of the avant-garde, the relationship between high art and mass culture, the changing identities and aims of the modern artist, and the institutional basis of art production.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/joanna-gardner-huggett.html">4.56</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/joanna-gardner-huggett.html">Joanna</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/joanna-gardner-huggett.html">Gardner-Huggett</a></td><td>10:00 AM</td><td>1:30 PM</td><td>201</td><td>20425</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Joseph</td><td>Socki</td><td>1:00 PM</td><td>2:30 PM</td><td>202</td><td>26092</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday,Thursday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
