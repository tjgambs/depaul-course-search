The course has several goals. The first one is to develop some basic communicative skills in Spanish as a second language. These include but are not limited to the following sample abilities: taking about feelings and mood changes, talking about what people do to and for each other, expressing wishes and desires, narrating present and past actions, describing current events, using vocabulary related to professions and daily life.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/jennifer-whitelaw.html">4.2</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/jennifer-whitelaw.html">Jennifer</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/jennifer-whitelaw.html">Whitelaw</a></td><td>9:40 AM</td><td>11:10 AM</td><td>201</td><td>21107</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
