Through fiction, drama, biography, autobiography, film, audio recordings, and gender, the course explores representations of the diva in literature, art, and popular and high culture. The goal of this course is to investigate the ways that "diva" has actually been code for women (and sometimes men) behaving outside of societal norms. Students will do this both historically and thematically, uncovering a path in which "women behaving badly" are routinely censured, and silenced. Students will also investigate how women both resist and re-appropriate this label.This course also seeks to explore the lives of both extraordinary and ordinary women, contextualizing the historical moments that they both contested and were sometimes consumed by.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/robin-mitchell.html">4.6</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/robin-mitchell.html">Robin</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/robin-mitchell.html">Mitchell</a></td><td>2:40 PM</td><td>4:10 PM</td><td>201</td><td>21373</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday, Wednesday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
