Accordingly, this course traces the life-cycle of a dating relationship. Specifically, this course begins by examining initial interactions that are potentially romantic and could turn into dating interactions. Next, the course focuses on how people engage in dating relationships and the factors that influence relationships. Finally, the course concludes with what happens after dating (i.e., long term commitment/marriage, relational termination, or the death of a partner).
