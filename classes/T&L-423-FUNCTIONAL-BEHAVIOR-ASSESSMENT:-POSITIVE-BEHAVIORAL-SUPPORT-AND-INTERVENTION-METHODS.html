Grounded in principles of Applied Behavior Analysis, the philosophy of the course is based on the premise that understanding the underlying causes of children?s externalizing and internalizing behavior enables the teacher to utilize appropriate techniques in conducting behavior intervention and classroom management. Using Positive Behavioral Support and Functional Behavior Analysis (a competency required for all teachers under the provisions of IDEA), students will learn how to design and develop a Behavior Intervention Plan. Diverse methods for addressing a variety of behaviors are explored and practiced through field-based assignments that include application of behavioral assessment and intervention tools, as well as techniques. Understanding the impacts of current legislation, policy and research on practice is fostered and developed.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/mojdeh-bayat.html">4.93</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/mojdeh-bayat.html">Mojdeh</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/mojdeh-bayat.html">Bayat</a></td><td>5:30 PM</td><td>8:45 PM</td><td>201</td><td>26443</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
