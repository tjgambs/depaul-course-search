Students will complete a series of assignments that will utilize different methods of finding inspiration to make a cohesive, narrative work.  Various methods used in both commercial and independent productions will be presented as examples, and pre-production work from both live action and animated films will be viewed throughout the quarter.  Students will create several storyboards for short films, write treatments, and research design options.
