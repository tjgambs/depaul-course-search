In this interdisciplinary class, students will explore the historically contingent nature of musical and poetic convention, changing ideas of love and gender relationships, and the importance of biography in the reception of love songs. While the course will have a broad historical scope, an emphasis on modern popular music will allow students to apply critical reading and listening skills to the music they already appreciate.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>4</td><td>Anna</td><td>Schmidt</td><td>2:40 PM</td><td>4:10 PM</td><td>201</td><td>26375</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday,Thursday</td> </tr>
