Students will apply basic music theory concepts to the work of prominent popular songwriters from the late 1940s through the 1980s, a period of stylistic unity that shaped contemporary popular music. Orally, and through transcriptions and written analysis, students will discover musical characteristics that define historical styles, and pay particular attention to distinctive traits of individual artists. A typical class will consist of discussing recordings, transcriptions, and artist interviews as a class or in groups.
