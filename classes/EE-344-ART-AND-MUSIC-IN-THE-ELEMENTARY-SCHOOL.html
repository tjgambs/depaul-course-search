Students will  explore a variety  of art forms and disciplines to develop a critical aesthetic and artistic vocabulary.  Students  learn to help children utilize artistic media in the  exploration and expression of thoughts and feelings.  Emphasis is placed on  design, construction, and implementation, and assessment of authentic conceptual classroom arts activities that integrate the arts with other classroom curricula.  Daytime clinical hours (10) are required during this course.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>24391</td><td>Rachel</td><td>Harper</td><td>8:30 AM</td><td>11:45 AM</td><td>201</td><td>24391</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Friday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
