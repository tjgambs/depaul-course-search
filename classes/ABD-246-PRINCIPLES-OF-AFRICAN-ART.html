The course will focus on the arts of royalty as a means by which to introduce basic concepts and larger issues within the field.  The arts of groups who borrow from royal iconography, such as diviners, religious cults, societies of elders, and others, will also be investigated.  Themes pertinent throughout the course include issues of gender, colonialism, cultural interaction, and historical change in both visual art and the nature of kingship.
