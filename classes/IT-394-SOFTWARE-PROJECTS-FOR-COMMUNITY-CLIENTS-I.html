The second quarter will be IT 395. You will earn four quarter hours of credit for each quarter for a total of eight quarter hours of credit.  You must complete both quarters to receive any credit. We work with a community service organization, chosen with help of the Steans Center for Community-based Service Learning.  As a community-based service learning course, students will have the opportunity to assess urban community needs in technology, and use problem-solving methods and strategies to make a substantial difference in an inner-city community group, usually by developing an application or a web site.
