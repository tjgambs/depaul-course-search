Originating over 220 million years ago, they dominated earth's land biomes for over 150 million years and diversified to include the largest land animals in earth's history, a wide range of acquatic groups, and even a diverse clade capable of flight (the birds). Consequently, mammals remained in the background as small nocturnal creatures during the dinosaurs' long reign. Only after a cataclysmic extinction event 65 million years ago involving most dinosaur groups did the mammals diversify into modern groups including our own primate lineage. This course will introduce students to the remarkable dinosaurs, tracking their origin, surveying their success, and evaluating their decline. Learning will emphasize investigation of the forms, function, and variation within the major dinosaur groups as well as the connections of dinosaur evolution to diverse factors such as climate change, ecology, biological competition, and mass extinction. The course learning activities will encompass discussions, readings, lectures, labs, internet resources, museum resources and original inquiry.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>Kevin</td><td>Downing</td><td>6:15 PM</td><td>9:30 PM</td><td>801</td><td>26670</td><td>O'Hare Campus</td><td>Tuesday</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>Kevin</td><td>Downing</td><td>6:15 PM</td><td>9:30 PM</td><td>802</td><td>26671</td><td>O'Hare Campus</td><td>Tuesday</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>Kevin</td><td>Downing</td><td>6:15 PM</td><td>9:30 PM</td><td>803</td><td>26672</td><td>O'Hare Campus</td><td>Tuesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
