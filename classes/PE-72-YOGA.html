Participants will develop skills to deepen conscious awareness and focus through asana practice (physical practice of yoga), body alignment, breathing techniques, and relaxation. The emphasis of the class will be on how to properly practice yoga, how to incorporate it into daily life, and how to safely teach asana. Course modules will include physical practice, handouts, support materials, and a quiz. Students will be required to attend and participate in class. The development of an independent home practice of yoga outside of DePaul will be necessary for success in the course.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>2</td><td>Staff</td><td>Staff</td><td>9:40 AM</td><td>11:10 AM</td><td>201</td><td>24584</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
