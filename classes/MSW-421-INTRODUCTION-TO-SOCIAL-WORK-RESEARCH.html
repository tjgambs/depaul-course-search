MSW 421 presents the conceptual foundations and methods of research in order to assist students with integrating research knowledge with professional social work practice and ethics. The course focuses on the quantitative and qualitative methods. The course covers the research process from problem identification through the conceptualization of research questions, sampling, design, measurement, data collection, analysis, and dissemination of findings. Additionally the course pays specific attention to ethics in research and issues of race, class, gender and sexual orientation.
