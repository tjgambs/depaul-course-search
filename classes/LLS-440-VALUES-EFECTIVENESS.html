When individuals expand awareness of their own choices and recognize the choices of others, they can live their own lives more effectively and successfully mediate conflicts with others. Central questions include: What should I do in this situation? Why did he/she/they decide to do things that way when it seems so clearly wrong to me? Seminar sections in this domain might address topics such as ethical reasoning, decision-making, values-clarification, priority setting, courage in action, etc.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Gabriele</td><td>Strohschen</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>201</td><td>23526</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
