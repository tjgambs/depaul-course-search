Theory and practice principles are woven into course assignments and required field experiences designed to observe, teach, and reflect upon instructional decisions made for individual as well as groups of children. Prevailing curricular and instructional models (e.g., code-based, meaning-oriented, balanced) and their histories are compared and contrasted. The influences of development, home language(s) and dialect(s) (especially those of U.S. metropolitan areas), and educational settings are studied and applied to candidate instructional planning and teaching.  Case studies and lesson planning facilitate the application of course content.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/marie-donovan.html">4.58</a></td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/marie-donovan.html">Marie</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/marie-donovan.html">Donovan</a></td><td>8:00 AM</td><td>11:10 AM</td><td>201</td><td>24387</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
