HC 168 JAMAICA: WHO TALKS TO WHOM IN SCHOOLS AND CAFES?
"Through onsite visits to schools and public places in Kingston, Mandeville, and Ocho Rios, Jamaica, participants in this course will study intercultural communication by observing verbal and non-verbal interactions in various contexts. Participants will examine communication dynamics in informal settings, such as cafes, plazas, and music venues, and in the formal setting of schools and universities. Using concepts from assigned readings, participants will analyze how different socio-cultural factors interact to shape individuals and interaction patterns in urban and rural Jamaica, as well as in the United States.

Prior to departure, participants will work collaboratively to develop culturally sensitive observation criteria for evaluating and comparing communication and interactions. On-site they will dialogue about the observations and interpretations with University partners from the host country. This course, though ideal for educators wishing to understand the role of language and cultural in different settings among multicultural groups, also provides a background for those interested in sociolinguistics, intercultural dynamic and multiculturalism abroad and at home.

Individual projects due upon return from the study abroad will further allow students in other fields to explore communications in their particular setting."
