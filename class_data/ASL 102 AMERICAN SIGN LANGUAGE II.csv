ASL 102 AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE II
"This is the second Basic American Sign Language course in a series of ASL courses. Students will develop expressive and receptive ASL skills through discussions of topics such as living situations, family and occupations, and daily routines or activities. In addition, students will develop storytelling skills. Throughout the session, readings about Deaf culture will also be incorporated since a language cannot be separated from its culture."
