ARB 105 INTERMEDIATE ARABIC II
"Intermediate Arabic II is the second course of three intermediate Arabic courses that focus on taking students to the advanced level of proficiency by expanding their knowledge of Arab culture, building their vocabulary, and developing their grammar skills. Intermediate Arabic will focus on broadening students' knowledge of the Arabic language beyond the daily life topics. Students will be introduced to examples of authentic materials of Arabic Literature that include topics of general and professional interests, in order to increase students' comprehension skills and prepare them to understand the literary and cultural context of the Arabic language. In addition, this course will emphasize two main points: (1) how mastering grammar concepts is crucial for understanding Arabic texts as well as for communicating clearly in speech and writing; and (2) how the derivation system is key for developing vocabulary. ARB 104 or equivalent, including placement test or permission of instructor, is recommended."
