PRF 122 MOVEMENT I
"Second course in a 3 course sequence.  Two quarters of movement based on the technique of yoga as a means for the discovery of body mechanics, physical alignment, self-use, and over-all self awareness. One quarter will continue with the elements explored in yoga but will be more focused on freeing the self through the use of music, movement improvisation, and a variety of coordination skills."
