LL 140 WRITING WORKSHOP
"The Writing Workshop will help students be more confident, efficient and effective writers through individualized support from a writing instructor. Each student will choose at least one academic writing project to draft in the course and will work with the instructor to accomplish this goal using a structured writing process.  If it fits in their plan, students may use the Writing Workshop to work on papers for competence in other courses or through the ILP process. Depending on the competence(s) chosen, the student will complete writing assignments in the field of arts and ideas, human community, scientific world, or the student?s focus area."
