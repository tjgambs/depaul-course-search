SW 337 THE HUMAN GENOME AND ITS IMPACT
"This course will address the principles of genetics with an emphasis on the genetic code of the human genome.  In this course we will examine: how the genetic code is stored, how it is used, how it is evolving, how it is passed from one generation to the next, the consequences of genetic code errors, the medical, technological, legal and ethical issues associated with the human genome. We will discuss how we can, and how we should, use the information on the human genome."
