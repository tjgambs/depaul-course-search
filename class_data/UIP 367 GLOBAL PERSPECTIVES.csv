UIP 367 GLOBAL PERSPECTIVES
"Global Perspectives is designed to support students' developing viewpoints and experiential reflections during an intensive internship in Honduras. Students will explore case studies, commentary, research, and personal interviews in order to draw conclusions and apply what they've learned to their own future careers.  Students are required to work 100 hours.  Attendance at an internship orientation meeting is required. . All of our 4-credit UIP courses fulfill the JYEL learning requirement. If you have completed the requirement already, the course will be counted as a general elective course."
