"LL 250 FOUNDATIONS OF ADULT LEARNING: DEVELOPING PERSONAL, PROFESSIONAL AND EDUCATIONAL GOALS"
"In this required course, students use structured reflection and analysis to assess themselves as learners, write learning goals, do preliminary research in their focus area, meet with their mentor, establish an academic committee and plan the remainder of their undergraduate program.  They master the notion of competence and identify ways of achieving it through prior and future learning. The course includes organizing a portfolio that will be an ongoing resource to support and document students' accomplishment of their learning goals. Students should take this course early in their program so they have a clear pathway to graduation. This course satisfies two competencies: L2 (Foundations) and F1 (Focus Area Planning)."
