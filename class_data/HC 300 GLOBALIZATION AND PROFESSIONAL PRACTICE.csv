HC 300 GLOBALIZATION AND PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE
"For decades scholars have observed a growing body of evidence and employers a growing body of experience of significant changes in the way that international business is conducted. These changes in the business world, brought on largely by globalization, present new challenges. These challenges require staff with specific skills related to global competence in order for the business to remain competitive. The goal of this course is to help students to cultivate and/or refine the skills and capabilities necessary to succeed in today?s global work environment.  Organized around four learning units and one major project, the class will provide each student with extensive content and resources; it will also provide a forum for assessing the competences necessary to attain success in a global workplace and a method for honing those skills each student needs to cultivate."
