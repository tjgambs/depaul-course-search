The expected movement in these variables is important for business and consumer decisions.  The Fed has been criticized as of late for policies that put us into the recent financial crisis and for policies that do not appear to be getting us quickly out of the current slowdown, but instead are setting the country up for higher inflation.  This course will focus on the theory and evidence of what the Fed does (and other central banks do), why they do it and how what they do affects our well-being. It is meant to demystify their policies by providing a rationale behind their statements and actions. Unlike most courses that rely on textbooks, this course will have numerous topics and readings that do not yet appear in traditional texts.

In our current experience, more families differ from that model than comply with it.  Family structure is evolving.

What influences family structure? Do economics and education make a difference?  Are race and ethnicity important factors? What about gender, personality and religion? Is the two parent family necessary? What role do grandparents and great grandparents play in the changing family? Perhaps the most important question we can ask about the family is what comes next. What are the many ways in which families might be redesigned in the future? How do these changes impact individuals in society?

For example, narrative and narrative performance are increasingly being used as part of medical curriculum, as a means to train health care professionals to understand the experiences of their patients, encourage deep listening, and foster different professional-patient relations. For cancer, HIV/AIDS, and other patients, performance becomes a means of speaking into mainstream and dominant discourses of health and to actively shape discourses from their own subjectivities. This increases the visibility of health care experiences in their gendered, sexualized, and racialized dimensions. Finally, narrative and narrative performance offers an additional means of visibility in catalyzing change in public, legislative, scholarly and relational arenas.","tags":"Class Status, Location, 5:45 PM, Class Section, 9:00 PM, Teacher Last Name, Class End Time, Class Start Time, 25966, Loop Campus, Teacher First Name, Monday, William, 4, 201, N/A, Days, Baglia, Class Number, Overall Rating, Credit Hours, Open","url": "classes/HTHC-525-NARRATIVES-IN-HEALTH-CARE.html"},

They will investigate how the ancients used traditional narratives and images to explore, explain and experiment with ideas about themselves and their surroundings in those contexts. Learning about how myth is variously interpreted (as for example by means of theories of myth-interpretation) as well as basic methods of literary criticism (e.g., analysis of language, content, structure, etc.), students will employ ways to identify, understand and interpret the different types of communication present in myth-literature. As they move chronologically through the ancient world students will observe how myths change to reflect differing individual and collective concerns, as well as the specific interests (and so the significant aspects of discourse) of authors and audiences as conditions change. Students will also learn about literary genres, including poetry, tragedy and prose, their properties and distinctions and discover how genres also reflect audiences and times. Students will read and evaluate modern views of myth in order to understand how myth is open to multiple interpretations and upon what sounder bases myth is to be interpreted.

They will be able to describe the plots of the three epics and know the main- and mid-level human characters, gods, and goddesses. They will be able to define and better understand the meanings of hero and heroism. Students will be able to express mature appreciation for the epics as whole works. Learning how the epics are variously interpreted as well as basic methods of literary criticism (e.g., analysis of language, content, structure, etc.), students will employ these as ways to understand and interpret the poems. As they read, learn and evaluate modern views of the epics, students will also acquire better means to distinguish critically between views and interpretations. A strong emphasis in this class will be upon the vital connections between past and present, and how students can become more aware of and understand important lasting concepts such as heroism, leadership, self-definition, etc. Finally, students will relate these stories to modern story-telling in order to understand how the heroes of the ancient Greeks live with us today. In short, they will interpret what epic poetry offered ancient listeners and what it has to teach modern readers.

We are, in fact, dependent for survival upon climatic conditions remaining within certain rather narrow ranges of the possible variation.

Climate stability over the last 4,500 years has permitted us to invent cities and engage in agriculture and hydraulic engineering, science, and many other activities which we recognize as civilized and like to think of as advances.  However, in an extremely short period of time, only two centuries, we have reached a stage of interaction with the climate which jeopardizes the very regularities in climate on which we depend. In order to understand what our options are we must learn to understand the climate system within large interacting frameworks of geography, geology, chemistry, physics, and ecology over long spans of time.  This level of complexity urgently calls on us humans for an exploration of a robust Earth-oriented ethic.  In this course we will build from simple observations to more complex understandings and the exploration of possible futures with scenario thinking.

In Everyday Ecology we will analyze our energy use patterns and explore practical alternatives.  The word ecology originates from the meshing of two Greek words meaning the study of homes.  Although the main focus of this course is the individual household, another ?household? we must take into account is the economy. Ecological economics examines how both disciplines need to look toward the other to be viable long term. We will examine options to bring the earth household (ecology) and the human household (economy) together for the benefit of both. This course observes how ?man? is connected to the world around him. It allows us to see our options in response to growing concern over global climate change. Through readings, field trips, activities, discussions and an analysis of our personal use of energy, this course enables  us to become increasingly aware of ecological issues.

Through group work we will determine a framework for ethical thinking and will apply this framework to specific situations facing the theatre profession today, ultimately determining whether or not the result is an ethical decision.","tags":"Lincoln Park Campus, Class Status, Location, Class Section, Teacher Last Name, Class End Time, Class Start Time, Teacher First Name, 1:00 PM, 4, 25425, Alcorn, 201, N/A, Days, Tuesday, Thursday, Class Number, Overall Rating, 2:30 PM, Narda, Credit Hours, Open","url": "classes/THE-214-ETHICAL-DECISION-MAKING-N-THE-THEATRE.html"},
{"title":"THE 215 PLAYS ABOUT SPORTS","text":"There is a curious relationship between sports and theatre; that is to say, the inherent theatricality of sports and the inherent athleticism of theatre.  A significant component in this relationship is the concept of performance and what that entails.  We speak of high-performance cars and trucks, we applaud and then discuss, blog, and tweet (sometimes to an extraordinary degree) the performances of both athletes and actors, we talk about academic performance, we see performing seals, dolphins, and whales at Shedd Aquarium, a member of the clergy performs a wedding ceremony, and the list continues.  A highly contested term, performance is bound to the team role as it relates to sports, theatre, and everyday life. What is your role on the team?  What role were you cast in?  What is your role in the company?  The team role is aligned with function and also with the context in which the role is played.More than anything perhaps, both sports and theatre deal with highly charged relationships.  In the plays that we will examine in the course, it is the sport itself that serves as both the context of and trigger for the relationships that are created, strengthened, weakened, or in the worst-case scenarios, totally shattered.","tags":"Lincoln Park Campus, Class Status, Location, Class Section, Teacher Last Name, Class End Time, Class Start Time, Teacher First Name, 25426, 4, 201, Louis, Days, N/A, Tuesday, Thursday, 4:10 PM, Class Number, Overall Rating, Contey, Credit Hours, 2:40 PM, Open","url": "classes/THE-215-PLAYS-ABOUT-SPORTS.html"},
