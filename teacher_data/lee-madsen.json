Growing up with so many diverse experiences, not to mention location changes, clearly helped establish and broaden his vision as a filmmaker.\n \nBy high school, Lee had already appropriated his older brother's video camera and begun making short films with his friends. What started as a hobby, eventually lead him to formally studying directing at the New York Film Academy. After school, he moved to Los Angeles and started working behind the scenes in film and television, continuing his education at UCLA's film extension program. His directing career started with a 40-minute award winning short, Becoming Irish.\n \nOver the past 10 years Madsen has written and directed three feature films Players, Happy In The Valley and Hated - all of which have received international acclaim (winning over 15 festival awards) and distribution deals. Players is distributed by Screen Media and Universal Home Entertainment and aired on National TV (ABC). Hated is distributed by Filmbuff, a top distributor of streaming content, and is available on iTunes, Amazon Prime, Hulu and other streaming platforms. Happy In The Valley is distributed by Indican Pictures and premiered on The Movie Channel - January 2015.\n\nIn 2013 Madsen relocated from sunny Los Angeles to Chicago, where he recently completed filming and editing his new short film/tv pilot, \"Chicagoan\", and is currently working on his next feature project, The Translator, a Science-Fiction Adventure. \n \nMadsen and his wife Beth recently had their first child in February 2014. They consider Chicago the greatest city in the world (except for the potholes)."}
