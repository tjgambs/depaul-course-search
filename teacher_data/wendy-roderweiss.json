She spent over a decade in independent film, working in virtually every department.  She decided to leave the daily grind of production work to focus on her own projects as well as making documentary films for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.\n\nShe has written and produced numerous short films that have shown at film festivals across the country. Wendy, along with partner Natasha Bayus, completed a feature length documentary on hospice nurses in 2012 and continues to work on a comedic short film series based on the five stages of grief. The first film in this series, 'Stage One' is distributed by Ouat Media and premiered on Movieola in 2012.\n?\nShe also has a passion for audio, and with the group Higher Mammals has contributed to NPR's All Thing's Considered, Day to Day and Radio Lab. She produces a variety of podcasts about medicine and is developing a new science podcast for kids called SHABAM!  Most recently she produced the audiobook \"Concrete, Invisible, Bulletproof and Fried: My Life as a Revolting Cock\" with Chicago Musician Chris Connelly.\n\nWhen not working on her films, Wendy can be found teaching at DePaul University, hanging out with ER docs, singing Soprano in whatever chorus will have her, and talking motorcycle tech with her family at the ?Bonneville Salt Flats (Where they broke a land-speed record--thank you very much!)\n?\nShe also hates Cilantro.\n\nwww.contrarianfilms.com"}
