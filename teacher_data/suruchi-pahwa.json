The next thing I knew, I was pursuing my Masters in Film and Animaton at Rochester Institute of Technology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have had the opportunity to work on games for a portable gaming system called  Play PorTT along with several commercials and DVD's for Children. My Short Films have won many awards and entered several Film festivals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I love Music, Traveling, Hiking, Food and Off beat movies."}
