Recent works explore memory and longing through constrained spaces, videos of stillness and light, transformed neighborhoods, and reconstructed classical narratives. She loves books as much as you do, elementary level science projects, and talking to people about what they love.\n\nChelsea grew up in Michigan, and returns often. She earned an MFA from The University of South Florida in interdisciplinary studio. As the founder of Neighborhood Watch: Projection Walk she immersed herself in the projects of other artists and communities to grow and adopt and open grassroots approach to producing public art on a pedestrian scale through site specific installation with video. Later, in Chicago, as a board member of Experimental Sound Studio in Chicago, IL, and Member of Spoke Chicago an experimental studio and exhibition space, Cossu honed the balance of rigorous investigation, structure, and chance in experimental fields. She is seeking the continuation of these ideals in her personal artistic practice. Currently, Chelsea lives and works in Chicago as a Lecturer in DePaul University\u2019s College of Computing and Digital Arts, and tries to be a part of as many experimental pursuits as time allows."}
