He creates award winning video content for B2C and B2B organizations. However, he believes that it\u2019s all about B2P,  business to people. It\u2019s about connecting to every audience in an affecting way that drives engagement regardless of what a business or organization does.\n\nAnd to drive that engagement, Ken believes in the power of story as presented through authentic, dynamic video content.\n\nIn a long career filled with many highlights, he is successful not only because he\u2019s on the cutting edge of technology and technique but also because of his ability to find the heart of a story is enhanced with each passing year.\n\nKen likes to daydream (sometimes too much) while riding the commuter train from his suburban home to his office in Chicago. And his favorite season is summer, for watching blockbusters in IMAX, and picking  fresh tomatoes from his backyard garden.\n\nConnect with Ken on LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/storyview\nSee StoryView\u2019s work at: storyviewllc.com or vimeo.com/storyview/videos"}
