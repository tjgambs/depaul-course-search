He holds an MFA in Film/Video, and a BA in Biology.  He is happy to have spent so much time deep in the sciences, as the scientific process heavily influences his filmmaking.  He enjoys writing and directing both fiction and nonfiction films, though the past few years have brought him more opportunities to practice and polish his skills as a cinematographer for his own and others\u2019 documentaries.\nHe loves to travel and experience different cultures.  Before beginning graduate school, he lived in China and taught English.  While there, he never did see the Great Wall, but did enjoy long afternoons in tea houses talking politics with retired teachers and former sent-down girls, and late nights discussing the concept of \u2018liberation\u2019 with Tibetans over beers.  Documentaries offer him the kind of travel opportunities he craves; to access, experience and learn from people and places on a level of intimacy rarely granted to someone from someplace else.  So far, filming has taken him to Russia, England, Israel, Palestine, India, Japan, Ecuador and around the United States.  The world is filled with inspiring people doing amazing things; he'd like to meet them all."}
