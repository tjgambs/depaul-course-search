My dissertation dealt with modeling edge plasmas in fusion devices.  After completing a 3 year post-doctoral appointment at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, I worked as a Project Engineer at Schlumberger Oil Well Services,  doing research on neutron logging tools.  I subsequently joined my Alma Mater as a Visiting Research Associate in the program for Arms Control, Disarmament and International Security, while simultaneously teaching Calculus and Nuclear Engineering.  I finally joined DePAUL CTI in the Fall of 2000 and have been teaching various courses in Computer Science, E-Commerce Technology, Computer Graphics and Animation, and Human-Computer Interactions on a part-time basis. I am also a full time Mathematics professor at the City Colleges of Chicago, based at Harold Washington College.  I teach various topics, including Statistics, Trigonometry and Calculus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"}
