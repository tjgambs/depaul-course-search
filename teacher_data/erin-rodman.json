As a writer, Erin is a Nicholl Fellowship semi-finalist and a Family Friendly Programming Forum award winner, and has written scripts for companies including Zentropa Entertainment and Disney International. Erin also has an MFA in Screenwriting from Loyola Marymount University, an MA in Film and Television Studies from the University of Glasgow and has been a lecturer in film at the University of Strathclyde in Scotland.\n\nBut it all started with Erin's first internships and production assistant jobs, a rite of passage which includes riding in an ambulance with a bleeding stuntman dressed as a cowboy, shopping in LA for a producer in Montreal for items featured in the NY Times, and nearly being fired because there were just too many tomatoes in that director's salad. Erin currently lives in Los Angeles, loves every bit of show business and does a lot of hiking because it's sunny ALL the time."}
