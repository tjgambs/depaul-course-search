I have a BS in Psychology/Political Science from the University of Iowa, a MS in Computer Information Systems from Regis University, and have completed all of the course work for an MS in Strategic Intelligence from the Defense Intelligence College.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Professionally I have been in the information technology field as a consultant and permanent employee for over 20 years.   I have been involved in all phases of the SDLC during the implementation of both client-server and web based applications accessing Oracle and MySQL databases.   Prior to that I spent 12 years in the USAF as an Intelligence officer specializing in Imagery Interpretation; I separated and went into the reserves where I retired in March 2004 as a Major after 20 years of total service.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Personally, I like to play most sports, but focus on golf in the summer and bowling in the winter.  I am married and have four children; two boys and two girls."}
