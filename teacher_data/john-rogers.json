{"department": "School of Computing", "phone": "(312)362-8334", "email": "jrogers@cdm.depaul.edu", "biography": "&lt;p&gt;\nThis is my twenty-first year at DePaul.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\nI hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Universtiy of Chicago (1995).  I also hold a Master's Degree in Computer Science (IIT, 1986) and a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Studies (Northwestern, 1978).\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n  I have taught in a variety of settings, including in industry (Texas Instruments), at a community college (Triton College), and as a graduate student at U. of C.  Since coming to CTI/CDM in 1995 I have taught numerous undergrad and grad courses.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My primary research area is computational complexity but I'm interested in constructive logic, graph theory, and computability theory (until recently called recursion theory).\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\nI am also very involved with understanding how information technology is used by community-based organizations (CBOs) in providing their services. In cooperation with DePaul's Steans Center for Community-based Service Learning, I have worked with CBOs in Chicago's West Humboldt Park neighborhood.  In December, 2004, and again in June, 2006, I went on faculty/staff trips to Kenya.  \nDuring the summer of 2014 I spent four weeks at the Ghana Technology University College in Accra, Ghana, co-teaching a web programming course.  I hope to develop further DePaul's relationship with GTUC as both schools have much in common in terms of approaches to teaching.  \n&lt;/p&gt;"}
