I've always drawn comics, and have always been searching for ways to put them out... contributing to school papers, making school papers when the school didn't have one, and making my own mini comics. Since Milwaukee I've lived in Portland Oregon, where I drew my first book Spiral-Bound, and Brooklyn, New York, where I drew the Unsinkable Walker Bean. I've recently moved to Chicago, Illinois, where I'm working on the second Walker Bean book. It is a very vibrant and supportive community of cartoonists here in Chicago, and it is the perfect place for a midwestern boy and his dog to draw and play fetch. \n\nI was the recipient of the Will Eisner Comic Industry Award for Talent Deserving Wider Recognition in 2005, and was nominated for the best Children's Album Eisner in both 2005 and 2011. I was one of four illustrators honored with the Maurice Sendak fellowship, it's inaugural year in 2010."}
